Along those lines...ever feel like you\\'re being gaslit? And not just by other people but also by yourself?\\n\\nI have spent most of my life suffering from one sickness or another. I\\'ve been diagnosed with migraines, anemia, PCOS, and Hashimotos. But mostly I\\'ve been diagnosed with nothing. After 37 years, I finally feel like I\\'m seeing a pattern and maybe it\\'s actually been the same sickness all along. But I can\\'t seem to break free from the mindset of \"oh, it\\'s probably from \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\"\\n\\n*My teeth hurt:* You probably have a sinus infection; You should brush and floss more; You\\'re aging\\n\\n*My sinuses hurt:* It\\'s the weather; You have a sinus infection\\n\\n*My throat hurts:* You shouldn\\'t smoke; It\\'s the weather\\n\\n*My eyes are full of gunk:* That\\'s normal; Clean your contacts more\\n\\n*I\\'m so tired:* It\\'s winter; Everyone\\'s Vitamin D is low; You\\'re aging; Everyone\\'s tired\\n\\n*I can\\'t breathe:* You\\'re overweight; You have anxiety; But does your chest hurt too?\\n\\n*I can\\'t do that much in one day:* You\\'re lazy; You\\'re depressed\\n\\nMaybe you have a magnesium deficiency? Maybe you have Lyme? Maybe it\\'s adrenal fatigue? Maybe it\\'s this? Maybe it\\'s that? Maybe it\\'s nothing?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe other day I was on the phone with my dad and mentioned to him that even though I don\\'t have a diagnosis for Sjogren\\'s yet, I\\'ve started to do the things I can to feel better. I am using every trick I can find. (I currently have two humidifiers pointing at my face and I can breathe without thinking about it for the first time days!) And then I found myself telling him that I might be wrong. Maybe this is just making me feel better because of the power of suggestion. Maybe it\\'s placebo effect. (I love placebo effect, by the way. It works even if you know it\\'s placebo! That\\'s fantastic!) And he was there, playing devil\\'s advocate for each of my symptoms and possible solutions. Making me feel, once again, like I\\'m making a big deal out of everyday pains and looking for patterns where there are none. He wasn\\'t being mean. But that\\'s all I\\'ve ever known - \"helpful\" people looking for ways I\\'m not sick while I\\'m talking about ways I am.\\n\\nWhy do I keep doing this to myself? Why do I let everyone else do it to me? I feel like crap. I struggle to breathe. I struggle to eat. Sleeping is about the only thing I can do pretty well right now.\\n\\nThis is real.

After that, I faced a lot of backlash from my mother and mother in law...

But how they are regulated in these patients is still unknown.  \\n>  \\n>Previous research identified a subunit of the Gq protein, called G*α*q, as a player in rheumatic diseases like lupus and\\xa0rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients were assessed for total and domain scores on the ESSDAI and the clinical ESSDAI (ClinESSDAI).

       " 'Personally I think the biggest issue that led me down this path was constantly getting lung and bronchial infections and UTIs that the doctors never told me about they just constantly prescribed antibiotics, I am nearly always feeling like trash and healing pretty damn slow along with always being covered in bruises and feeling dehydrated and unable to keep up with it. Things got way worse after I had my son in December of 2016, I’ve always had intense dental problems proper hygiene aside, countless dollars in dental work growing up. Constantly peeing from drinking so much water and still feeling thirsty, but all in all I developed a condition called Recurrent Corneal Erosion, and haven’t found anything on it in regards to Sjogrens. \\n\\nHas anyone else discovered their “underlying” and debilitating condition from extreme eye complications? I’ve almost needed surgery multiple times, and had countless emergency visits where my optometrist comes in on a damn holiday just so I can get antibiotics and a bandage lens placed. I’m always getting fluids in urgent care or the ER no matter what I drink. Summer is the worst. My oddest symptom is probably issues with hyperpigmentation and other various skin abnormalities. Addison’s disease is still being looked into by Endocrinology. \\n\\nI’ve seen a neurologist, cardiologist, gastroenterologist, optometrist, PCP, endocrinologist, and now awaiting Rheumatologist. I’ve even been referred to infectious disease specialists because my doctors were so at a loss. Forgive any improper terminology as I’m admittedly ignorant at times haha. \\n\\nAbout 4 months ago my GI symptoms got so severe from undiagnosed Celiacs that I got my GI referral, I’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy even to rule out the big bad C word since I also had pretty intense and intermittent rectal bleeding (sorry tmi) I lost about 30 lbs in a month and a half and that’s the other kicker I’ve been trying to pin down the cause of, I can eat exorbitant amounts of junk food and calories and MAYBE gain 3 lbs. it’s a constant battle to stay at my weight. My stomach is perpetually in upset in one form or another, I feel internal tremors and bizarre movement and popping sensations beyond normal gas bubbles. Then I developed heat and exercise intolerance problems and tachycardia that comes and goes, debilitating nausea and light-headedness, I’m actually wearing a ZIO patch for a week (primary wanted a month but we agreed on a week) that they are hoping to determine if it’s POTS or SVT from.\\n\\nMy CBC and Metabolic panels constantly come back “mostly” normal. My MPV and Anion gap are always very elevated and my RDW is recently getting pretty low. My kidney function seems to flip back and forth a lot in terms of functioning “too” well I was told and then being not so great. And I’ve even developed this bizarre Myoclonus (suspected terminology via consult the neuro hasn’t seen it but it started months ago as a twitch in my left thigh and has massively escalated, awaiting seeing my neuro again since it started becoming a daily problem) basically I’d have such odd muscle spasms/jerks that would cause me to repeatedly fall down or nearly fall down. I’m taking a low dose of Keppra that the ER prescribed with neuro consult to manage it because if I take more than half a pill of the Keppra I sleep for 4 days straight, I’ve noticed I’m highly sensitive to narcotic pain medication and medication with a sedating effect of any kind even antihistamines. I always wonder if that’s in part due to my dehydration problems. \\n\\nI have bizarre lines and ridges going both directions in my nails and my nail beds are shrinking by the day which is a more recent symptom, evidence of early clubbing in my nails even documented in ER and was curious if anyone else had a similar presentation of symptoms with their hands and nails.\\n\\nAll in all I have minimal background info on what the systemic results of this illness are and how it’s impacted others lives, I have nobody with anything close in my life and it makes it an even bigger struggle, so if anyone has tips or methods on explaining how this is so debilitating in everyday life in a way close ones and family members can grasp I’d also be eternally in debt. I get constantly belittled and insulted by my father that I live with due to being a single mother and I get called lazy and stupid and everything else in the book, they don’t understand the extent of my health problems and it’s a burden how much help I’ve needed help caring for my son at times, the guilt is causes is unrelenting. Luckily my son is beautiful and happy. My father has outright said it’s all in my head and the doctors will never find out what’s wrong with me and they never have gotten it right when I was young even, I was diagnosed with complex partial right temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy at the age of 3 that mostly produced absence seizures in the day and convulsive nocturnal ones that caused me to wet the bed until I was nearly 15.  A heart murmur that repaired itself, and like violently intense ADHD, I was heavily medicated on stimulants as a child just so I could attend public school and then my health was so poor as a teenager (mental and physical) that I had to do high school at home. I have a slight lazy eye that’s trained (mostly). But overall nothing too outrageous. \\n\\nMy period started in like 4th grade which is relatively early and puberty hit me like a damn train. I get frequent painful symptomatic ovarian cysts but do not have PCOS. One instance of one rupturing and almost requiring surgery a couple of years ago. Intestinal problems around 18 that almost required surgery (impaction more or less I ate something that wasn’t food.) I’ve never had great health but it isn’t horrible in my opinion. Within the past months my period has gone from heavy and like clockwork to short, late, light or not even there, I get cramps between periods all the time and I can’t get my OB who is also my PCP to listen to me about how it isn’t normal or okay.  Because there’s a lot of other health problems going on he just doesn’t want to unless I make a separate appointment and even then he won’t indulge me FULLY. So it’s a waste of my effort and money and time. \\n\\nI attribute it in part to being born of a mother with gestational diabetes and in turn I was born 10 lbs and 3 months early, massively underdeveloped heart and lungs, NICU for a week before I could be handled. Lack of oxygen while my heart was restarted multiple times is a suspicion for cause of my epilepsy. Basically I was trying to breathe amniotic fluids still when I needed to breathe air, is how it was explained. I was born not breathing. \\n\\nI always have had deep curiosity about preemies and their likelihood to developing health problems later in life but I never find much online, however in my instance I feel there is a connection. Maybe that’s just for peace of mind though.\\n\\nThis has just been a crazy diagnostic ride, first they thought PID, then eosinophilic esophagitis, then diabetes, then MS, Parkinson’s, they’ve looked into so many freaking diseases and whatnot it’s a miracle my insurance hasn’t committed homicide or canned me somehow. Sorry for the poor format and post construction as I’m managing a turkey of a two year old and am on mobile! \\n\\nAlso I’m curious about age of onset, as I’m a 26 y/o female. Symptoms that were more severe such as RCE developed over two years ago and have just gradually worsened. It’s taken 3 months for my doctor to even take my concerns seriously even with CONSTANT trips to urgent care and the emergency room for one problem or another, did anyone else face dismissal from their PCP?\\n\\nLooking forward to some feedback and I hope everyone is doing well with their symptom management and treatment and making the best of the weather as well! You all are amazing! ❤️ Is this post is out of line in any way just let me know and I’ll remove it!',\n",

       " \"What causes Sjogren’s? The simple answer is there isn't a consensus on what causes SS. \\n\\n“Researchers think Sjögren’s syndrome is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Several different genes appear to be involved, but scientists are not certain exactly which ones are linked to the disease, because different genes seem to play a role in different people. For example, there is one gene that predisposes Caucasians to the disease. Other genes are linked to Sjögren’s syndrome in people of Japanese, Chinese, and African American descent. Simply having one of these genes will not cause a person to develop the disease. Some sort of trigger must activate the immune system.\\n\\n\\nScientists think that the trigger may be a viral or bacterial infection. It might work like this: a person who has a Sjögren’s-associated gene gets a viral infection. The virus stimulates the immune system to act, but the gene alters the attack, sending fighter cells (lymphocytes) to the glands of the eyes and mouth. Once there, the lymphocytes attack healthy cells, causing the inflammation that damages the glands and keeps them from working properly. This is an example of autoimmunity. These fighter cells are supposed to die after their attack in a natural process called apoptosis, but in people with Sjögren’s syndrome, they continue to attack, causing further damage. Scientists think that resistance to apoptosis may be genetic.”\\n\\n[Source](http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/sjogrens_syndrome/#cause)\\n\\nResubmitted since I can't count.\\n\",\n",

However, my scalp has itched like I had lice or something for months now (don\\'t worry, I for sure don\\'t have lice haha). I\\'ve used head and shoulders shampoo, hair and scalp masks, exfoliating my scalp etc etc etc. There\\'s no dandruff-- I\\'m not shedding skin.

Has anyone found any solution?\\n\\n2) I have tried all sorts of lotions--- from regular bath and body works stuff, to non scented gentle lotions and baby lotion, to medicated lotions, and still my skin is super dry. This happens particularly around any joints--- behind and to the side of my knees, my elbows, my ankles, my shoulders. Nothing seems to work. I even tried vaseline and just ended up a greasy mess.\\n\\n3) My mouth isn\\'t just getting dry--what saliva I do have is getting thick and very mucusy. It attaches to my throat and creates little bubbles of air and sometimes seals off my sinus passages. It\\'s almost impossible to dislodge from coughing because it sticks like glue but when I DO manage to cough something out, it\\'s completely clear but very viscous in texture. Sometimes, it will happen so suddenly that it will make me gag. I almost threw up in my car today, and I DID throw up a few days ago because of it. There is no actual sinus drain to speak of, no stuffy nose, so it\\'s not sinus drain/snot/phlegm. I\\'ve tried biotene and while that works while I have an actual dry mouth, when I have this weird thickness in the back, the biotene seems to bond with it and make it thicker. It\\'s weird and gross.\\n\\n4) An abundance of Tonsil stones that aggravate my throat and a dry cough that has been going on for years.

I believe MMP9 starts the inflammatory cascade that results in the substantial dysregulation of the immune system (increased IL-6, increased CRP, increased BAFF, increased CXCL5, b12 deficiency, decreased Mucin production, etc) which result in salivary and acinar glad destruction.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe main phenotype for Sjogren's is post-menopausal women; I propose for this cohort it is Estrogen reduction that results in persistent MMP9 elevation, as Estrogen represses MMP9 activation.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668239  Vitamin D deficiency also elevates MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12454321 so Vitamin D-deficient, post-menopausal women might be doubling-down.  A high-fat diet also increases MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935427 so it could be that any combination that brings MMP9 levels above a critical point induces the persistent dysregulation found in Sjogren's.  All 3 combined would be fairly common among American women.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIn my wife's case, she is Vitamin D deficient but not post-menopausal; she only has oral mucosal involvement with no ocular presentation really.  Enamel defects that leave her susceptible to cavities and periodontitis; for her I propose P. Gingivalis which upregulates and cleaves MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939075/.  P. Gingivalis also rewires Toll-Like Receptor responses, leading to neutrophils stuck in an inflammatory state: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4071223/, and P. Gingivalis neutrophils are impervious to IL-10 induced apoptosis, allowing them to survive longer: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308905/pdf/0650.pdf In addition, P. Gingivalis-primed macrophages promote Tolerance mechanism, unlike naive or tnf-a co-stimulated: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158629\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nFor non-post-menopausal, with involvement in ocular (and/or oral presentation) I propose HSV1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873454 \\nor P.

My biggest issues have been mild dry mouth (which, coupled with long-undiagnosed bruxism, has led to a lot of dental problems), fatigue, and dry eyes. The thing that made me think I might have Sjögren's in the first place is that when I cry, I don't actually produce tears.

Besides all the scariness that is autoimmune in general, the increased risk for lymphoma, and other potential nastiness, I am absolutely *devastated* by the thought of never crying again. I'm an emotional person, and right now am also clinically depressed. I have absolutely ached for the catharsis that comes with crying these past ten years.

She lived with it for a little bit but then started noticing that she had swollen lymph nodes on her neck.  She didn't have a primary doctor at the time so she just got one that seemed close and had a few positive reviews.  The doctor was a nightmare.  Basically passed her off to a surgeon who biopsied the lymph nodes but couldn't find anything. Basically both of them said her problems were in her head.  At this point though, she started having extreme stomach pain. Especially if she ate certain foods.\\n\\nShe got a recommendation from a friend to go see a gastroenterologist who recommended she go to a rheumatologist (at first was gonna make her wait 2 months before seeing her but got lucky and there was a cancellation) . That person then asked her if she had gotten a lot of cavities lately.  She had just started going to the dentist this year after a long period of having no dental insurance. She had 10 cavities.... With this info, the doctor decided she probably had Sjogrens.They did the tests but made her wait a month before discussing the results. In the meantime they got her on those anti malarial drugs and the anti dryness drug.  \\n\\nWell during that time, the gastroenterologist finally got her in to do a endoscopy. They found that she had h. pylori.  She had been tested a couple of times prior (i forgot to mention) but no one had found it those times.  \\n\\nThen just last week after all this waiting and jumping around from doctor to doctor, they finally gave her the verdict that she indeed has SSA + Sjogrens.  Although the doctor was great in diagnosing her, they didn't really give her any advice or comfort, they just gave her a print out from that Sjogrens foundation site and sent her on her way.  \\n\\nAnywho, that's the story.

I recognize that my depression is situational but what to do when the situation causing it is incurable?  \\n\\nI was happy to see 2014 go.  I\\'ve spent way too much of that year either in bed or at the doctors.  It wasn\\'t all bad.  I did get remarried... to the man of my dreams, my high school sweetheart who is forever patient and supportive even if my main issue is a bad mood.  I was eager to start 2015 and finding new ways to meet my goals of feeling better and being able to do more with my family and try to get back to work.  \\n\\nSjogrens sucks.  I never aim to spend my time in bed, but I always end up there.  I mopped my kitchen floor.  It desperately needed it and I couldn\\'t stand feeling useless and it falling to my husband to come home from work only to have do what I can\\'t.  It doesn\\'t seem like much ... simply mopping a floor.  Who doesn\\'t mop their kitchen floor?  With 4 little ones in the house it needs to be done daily but it often gets pushed aside.  Then I can hear my mother as if she\\'s looking at my floor in disapproval saying \"I know you don\\'t feel well but you need to just decide you\\'re going to take care of your business and get it done\".  I love her but she sooo does not get it.  She likes to compare my fatigue with her staying up and hour or 2 later than usually because they had friends over for dinner.  I\\'d love to have friends over for dinner but not with my dirty kitchen floor!\\n\\nI was determined to start the year with a clean kitchen floor.  It wore me out.  My shoulders swelled and ached. I can deal with that.  I got comfortable and tried to relax with the kids ... the feeling of having a clean kitchen floor beat the misery my body was in.  But then the back pain started.  It was bad.  I soaked in hot bath, took my pain meds and retreated to bed-only it didn\\'t help and I couldn\\'t sleep.  All of sudden at 4 am, I couldn\\'t stop peeing.  3 trips to the bathroom in an hour each time with a bladder that felt like it would burst and on the 4th it hit me.  My urine had been getting darker and darker over that hour.  It didn\\'t concern me at first because I drink a ton of water all day but all of a sudden I couldn\\'t relieve myself.  The back pain instantly worsened and I thought I was going to throw up but then finally relief ... I was able to empty my bladder only to find blood clots had been blocking the flow.  The darkening of my urine was blood and the pain in my back from my kidneys.\\n\\nWhy would I attribute this to mopping my floor?  Because it happens every time I exert myself.  Only the last time I thoroughly cleaned my house, it was pancreatitis.  Before that it was pneumonia-twice.  And on 5 occasions in 2014, cleaning was immediately followed by shingles.  Not to mention the spontaneous bouts of lactation-that\\'s right...I said lactation.  Only my youngest child is 5 and I\\'ve never breast fed so my breasts do not like lactating.  I became engorged and had to buy a breast pump and take antibiotics for a month.  My doctor was speechless.  \\n\\nI have organ involvement and physical stress makes my immune system angry.  My recent marriage means my insurance has changed and now in the midst of new symptoms-potentially serious, I have no doctor.  Primary doesn\\'t take my new insurance and my rheumatologist unexpectedly closed shop.  I will be out of pain meds by Monday and anyone whose dealt with chronic pain knows that look you get from a doctor who doesn\\'t know you when you say you need a narcotic refill.  \\n\\nMaybe 2015 will not be my year after all.

Sjögren’s (SHOW-grens) syndrome is an autoimmune disease, a disease in which the immune system turns against the body’s own cells.

I found some Refresh Omega 3 preservative-free single-use drops at the drugstore yesterday when I was shopping to find what everyone said (but I’ll keep going down the list to ultimately try everything recommended). I put them in several mins ago (one ampoule per eye), and I can seeeeeeeeeee!!! The relief didn’t just instantly vanish like with my old natural tears drops!

No flowery soap, restrictive clothes, etc. I see rheumatologist in a few weeks and will bring it up with him I think, seeing as that he'll answer my random questions when other docs won't (Quite efficiently, too). \\n\\nI think I might be starting to get some dryness issues. I'm in my early 30's hormone levels are normal. Does using stuff like Replens help with preventing yeast infections? I'm doing some trial and error with lubricants during sex (Still getting a little pain there). The infections do seem to pop up a few days after, and husband doesn't have any yeast issues. Gynecologist brought up using Diflucan or something similar for a few months. I'd rather not do that if there's a less invasive solution.\",\n",

       " \"Hi. I don't know if I should post to this sub, chronic pain, or some other because I still dont have a formal diagnosis. For the past three weeks or more, I have been having a high level of pain focused on one joint. I hadn't been in to see my rheumy in a year bc it has been almost 3 years since the start of my health issues and I had gotten tired of the endless doctor merrygoround with little other than treating the symptoms and no official answer. In the meantime, I suffer and people around me think I am making it up, faking, being dramatic or whatever.  \\n\\nThis makes me so mad bc I used to be so active. \\n\\n3 years ago(ish): I had formerly trained in Tae Kwon Do and had made the switch to jiu jitsu. I also did yoga. And volunteered an as ESL teacher while homeschooling my son and working a part time job. Then I was exposed to TB through one of the refugees I was tutoring. I did not get TB, but I did begin feeling tired and achy all the time. Next thing I know, I can't buckle my seat belt without pain.  I blamed it yoga injury. Then all the other symptoms started. Dry eyes. Pain in more joints. I got a staph infection from my dry skin splitting open and exposing me to a round of it going around at work. But I didnt know it was staph at first.\\n\\nI went to a doctor who said the dry skin was due to winter (without looking at the site). He gave me a steroid cream to apply and gave me a sample of Lexapro bc apparently when women complain of pain and discomfort, they are just depressed. The steroids made the staph infection go wild. \\n\\nIn the meantime, I went to a hand surgeon about what I was now sure was carpal tunnel bc my right hand was hurting pretty badly within 5-15 minutes of typing. By this point, I was having hand weakness and burning in my arm. No sign of anything on x ray. I was referred for an EMG and some nerve issues were found. By now, the staph infection was still undiagnosed. \\n\\nI kept using the cream and I started being unable to walk correctly.  I was sent onto neurologist after the arm EMG bc of my complaints of impaired walking and arm pain, burning and tingling who dismissed my complaints rather quickly and rudely after mri revealed no plaques. At this point, I was tested for various things. I had a positive ANA result and was sent to rheumy. No other issues showed up in bloodwork other than low vitamin D and I was told to take otc meds for joint pain and given vitamin d rx.\\n\\nAt a certain point, I went to a different primary doc. He diagnosed the split skin issue as being colonized with staph. Not mrsa thankfully. I was given two different antibiotics. I had the worst weakness and walking issues clear up. It took eight months from my first complaint to this point.  \\n\\nOnto eye doc. Dry eyes confirmed by Schirmers and staining.  This was not enough for a formal Sjogrens diagnosis. Was then sent to have lip biopsy which I skipped due to doctor exhaustion at this point. Neurologist was an a-hole during one of my appointments and I don't cope well with people's attitudes. \\n\\nETC ETC Fast forward, given gabapentin for ongoing neuropathic pain. Told to take aleve for joint pain which made various joints feel hot achy and 'cottony' --dont know how else to describe it. Like they were stuffed with cloth but in a restrictive uncomfortable way. Not a fluffy padded Charmin way. Also diagnosed with Reynauds, but only after providing doctor with photographic evidence of fingers turning blue in an air conditioned office at work. Was given nifedipine. Side effect was a migraine that felt like childbirth via my skull. I've had a kid, so I know what that feels like.  \\n\\nFast forward 2013: I get tired of people saying things like, maybe you have fibromyalgia, and they say it condescendingly, with a sneer, like its code for hypochondria. I quit going to docs, quit taking my gabbers, even though they did lessen the arm burning and pain. Suffer. Start drinking more. Gain 11 lbs. I am short and so this is a lot of extra weight for me. Quit yoga. Quit activities. Lay in bed for hours and hours at a time in a combination of fatigue and depression. \\n\\n\\n2014: January, fatigue again. Skin splits in original site. The steroid cream first stupid doc prescribed me thinned my skin. It splits really easily all the time now.  Gets colonized again with staph. Also gets a new and improved mystery rash which spreads all the way to my nether regions bc dry skin is near my hindquarters. Antibiotics again. At least it didn't take eight months for them to do something about it this time.\\n\\nThen a new and improved finger pain comes around. My pinky knuckle. It feels broken. But I didn't do anything to break it. No sleeping anymore. I now have two different kinds of pain on one arm at the same time, non stop. I feel that I am going to go crazy. Go back to the one sympathetic doctor I have, my rheumy. She gives me a gentle lecture for being gone for a year, puts me back on the gabbers and takes xrays and new bloodwork. I was sure the knuckle was broken. Or fractured. Or inflamed. Something. Anything.  Nope. Xrays are normal. Bloodwork--effing normal. No markers of inflammation or others show out of range. She sends me home with a sample of Voltaren Gel, which i immediately begin using and seems to make no difference but comes with an awesomely worrisome side effect warning list. \\n\\nSo now what? Today the hand started swelling and I was glad. I took photos of it bc this is what I now feel I have to do to get someone to believe me other than my husband.  I dared my hand out loud to swell until it burst open bc then someone would have to do something about it. Something other than NSAIDs. I don't know which doctor to even go to about this. Its like being stuck in a hellish loop of choose your own medical adventure. Do I go (back) to a hand surgeon to see if its a tendon issue? Do I go to a new, hopefully non a-hole neuro and see if it is the neuropathy worsening and bringing some new complication? \\n\\nAnd in the meantime, I want to scream at anyone who dares to be skeptical about my condition when I used to train martial arts with grown men and I got a kick out of fighting and getting knocked around and knocking people back too.  I have had a child, bicycled to work for fun, P90x and all other sorts of extreme type workouts, taken various hits and soreness of all kind and not taken any sort of pain med for it other than a hot bath and gone back for more. So yes, when I say I can't use this hand or even put it through my sleeve without it hurting, it really does hurt. \\n\\nForgive my wall of text. This has been a long time coming and the first time I've gotten it all out. \\nTLDR: This stuff sucks. It hurts. We still don't know what all 'it' is and I am frustrated by it all.\\n\\nCan anyone please tell me if when their hand swells and hurts if they went through anything like this where there was no sign of explanation on the xray but it still ended up showing up on paper through bloodwork later? Tired of not knowing what is going on. Sorry for such a long post. I am angry and in pain.\",\n",

I've tested positive for Wegener's for about 18 months and have had one retinal vein occlusion (blood clot in the retina). I started developing Sjogren's-like symptoms 90 days ago. I also live with mast cell activation syndrome (aka MCAS), fibromyalgia, dysautonomia/POTS, and other chronic illnesses.\\n\\nGot a corneal burn (both eyes) in mid-July 2019 from accidentally looking in the direction of a ceiling light fixture while I was trying to check out some bugs on the ceiling. My eyes have never returned to normal, despite steroid eye drops. Still on steroid eye drops and started Restasis a week ago, all under care of an excellent ophthalmologist. He's the doc who told me my eye issues were autoimmune-related and asked me to discuss it with my rheumatologist.\\n\\nSaw rheumatologist a week ago and he thinks I have lupus and Sjogren's, and am teetering on the edge of Wegener's. I'm descended from the lineage of a consanguineous marriage (my maternal great-grandmother married her 1st cousin), and my mother's side of the family has a lot of genetic and autoimmune diseases as a result, unfortunately.\\n\\nI have to wear sunglasses at all times, indoors and outdoors, except in my apt., where I've changed all the bulbs to 15 watt bulbs. I still have to look away from my lighting fixtures, since the bulbs are all exposed and even at 15 watts, if I look at the bulb I'll get a corneal burn all over again. It doesn't matter how many Refresh drops I put in...severe light sensitivity remains. Doc told me it will take Restasis at least a month before it starts helping.\\n\\nI can't drive -- my sunglasses are not strong enough for me to drive west during the 2nd half of the day when the sun is setting...and I have very dark, anti-glare lenses. I wear a wide-brimmed hat to block light that my sunglasses don't, like light from above my head or sunlight coming at me from the side, which can get behind my sunglasses. \\n\\nI asked my docs (rheum & oph) if over time the Restasis would restore my previous tolerance for indoor and outdoor light...they said they don't know.\\n\\nFor those of you who have lived with Sjogren's for a while, how do you tolerate sunlight? How do you drive if you can't tolerate sunlight?\\n\\nA week ago my mouth and throat started to get dry. Sometimes I can't taste my food. And sometimes I have a chronic, light dry cough.\\n\\nAny advice regarding sunglasses and driving is very much welcome!\",\n",

And then my feet peel, just like after a sunburn. My skin has been tested and no fungus is present. I mostly wear flip flops to avoid the burn but my feet still peel, just not nearly as bad.

Thyroid cancer. They no longer cared about my salty mouth and cancelled my appointment with the ENT to discuss lip biopsy. The head and neck surgeon who removed my thyroid told me not to do the lip biopsy because I'd end up with a permanently numb lip. I think it was his office who cancelled my ENT appointment. That was 2017.\\n\\nCurrently, I'm coughing, short of breath, occasionally tingly feet, hands, and even lips. Some weird chest pain with breathing. I had the same thing happen in 2014 and no one ever figured it out. It went away on its own after a month or so.\\n\\nI have a congenital heart defect (discovered through all the testing in 2014) and my cardiologist just ruled out my heart as a cause of my current breathing issues.  I read something here about bronchiectasis and small fiber neuropathy. And now I'm wondering. I usually don't bother going back to the doctor's office because they can never seem to figure me out. \\n\\nI have one other weird symptom: my knee often hurts but it's not an injury type pain.

After my ESR came back high twice, he referred me to see a rheumatologist.\\n\\n*I was waiting a long time for that appointment because the healthcare system in Ireland is in shambles. When I got to see the rheumatologist, they said I am \"prone\" to fibromyalgia, dismissed my persistently high ESR and CRP as \"normal\" and sent me packing.\\n\\n*after complaining to the hospital about how woeful that appointment was, I received a new appointment for a second opinion. The second rheumy was lovely. Very helpful and keen to get to the bottom of the issue.\\n*He said he thinks that I have Sjogren\\'s syndrome. I am inclined to agree - lots of my symptoms that were never explained by fibromyalgia are explained by the diagnosis of SS. \\n\\n*Nothing\\'s definite yet. more tests need to be done. But its so odd having a potential diagnosis when you\\'ve been floating through uncertainty for years. It\\'s weird looking back on things that have happened (my tongue and glands randomly swelling, for example, and having a fever with no other symptoms) and thinking \"well shit, that could be caused by Sjogren\\'s.\"\\n\\nWell, thank you for reading... that was a ramble!\\n',\n",

That said, I'm still having a ton of joint pain and my dry eyes are becoming a huge problem despite my cocktail of drugs (plaquenil, exovac, and restasis). My rheumatologist said that he's going to try to get me into a clinical trial for a new drug they're developing for primary SS patients that he thinks is quite promising AND that the study will pay for extensive blood work not typically covered by insurance, a lip biopsy (to hopefully definitively make the diagnosis) and the drug, and I will be compensated for my time! I'm pretty much over the moon and I hope I qualify for the trial. \\n\\nHere's the question- What's your daily regimen in terms of managing the symptoms of your SS?

I'm having some side effects though- itchy skin (no rashes yet), extreme sensitivity to sun, and now I have this horrible burning sensation on my outer labia. I'm only 26 and I have had some issues with getting wet during intercourse previously, but this is next level. It feels like a chemical burn. It hurts so bad I can't even wear a panty liner or pad with it because it irritates it further. I have been tested previously and have no STIs and haven't had sex in over a month anyways. My Rheumy said that it's probably a yeast infection and unrelated to the plaquenil, so I have an appointment on Monday with my obgyn. But I've never had a yeast infection like this. No discharge, primary complaint is horrible burning/dryness/itching made worse by touching it. My mind is going two places though: could this be merely a symptom of sjrogens although not the typical presentation? Or a side effect of a generic version of plaquenil?  Anyone else have experiences like this with sjrogens? \\n\\nUpdate: All tests for yeast/bvi/stis came back negative. This is the 2nd time this has happened.

I went to the optometrist, he looked at my eyes and immediately sent me to the ophthalmologist, where he found several hemorrhages in my right eye.\\n\\nAfter undergoing a ton of blood tests, it turned out that I was positive for an autoimmune disease and was sent to a rheumatologist, where more tests were conducted. It was yesterday when he confirmed that I indeed have SS and was vitamin D deficient. \\n\\nMy symptoms today are primarily dry eyes and mouth, and indigestion. \\n\\nI have intermittent joint pain in my knee, shoulders and elbow, but I don't know how much of that is due to normal body pains and what, if any, can be attributed to SS.

My doctor prescribed me Plaquenil and Salagen, but in some of the research I read that others weren't able to deploy because of the medication.

He called me back saying to just quit taking the Plaquenil (which btw I did several days ago, but maybe it takes time for it to leave your system) and just wait until my next appointment. He said he wouldn't prescribe me anything else at this point because all the other drugs are much less well-tolerated. He also said I should just go to my primary care doctor, who I know will tell me to go to my rheumatologist and send me away after 5 minutes. \\n\\nI'm just frustrated and depressed... I really had high hopes for Plaquenil and it seemed to me that so many people have had great results with it with almost no side effects. Of course, I can't be sure that it's the Plaquenil causing all of this, but I honestly really hope that it is, because if not it means I've developed some new chronic complications. So what next?

       " 'Testing- Being properly diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome can be difficult. The average time between the onset of SS and a diagnosis is 4.7 years. Part of this delay is that there isn’t a single test that can confirm a diagnosis of SS and that it can appear differently in different patients. Instead doctors depend on several tests and a physical examination. Blood tests includes blood tests for ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody), RF (Rheumatoid Factor), SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La), IGs (Immunoglobulins) and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate). Ophthalmologic tests for SS include Schirmer Test to measures tear production and Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green Eyedrops to examine the surface of the eye for dry spots. Dental test for SS include salivary flow which measures the amount of saliva produced, the salivary scintigraphy which is a nuclear medicine test that measures salivary gland function and a salivary gland biopsy (usually in the lower lip) which confirms inflammatory cell (lymphocytic) infiltration of the minor salivary glands.\\n\\n[Source 1](https://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens-syndrome/sjoegrens-faqs)\\n\\n[Source 2](http://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens-syndrome/diagnosis)\\n',\n",

I have always had dry eyes and mouth, as well as swollen salivary glands and other issues, but I thought it was normal because I had no frame of reference. This has been the norm for me since I was about 12. I had only gone in the past 6 months because of joint issues I thought were unusual for my age/fitness level.\\n\\nHonestly, it was something I was more excited/happy about since I felt: hey! There's medication (started Plaquenil) and now I have a rheumatologist to help take care of me, and possible prednisone for really bad days. The day that I had gone in I was feeling great and NOTHING hurt, so rheumatologist said that my joints seemed good.\\n\\nBut today it's completely different and I'm really, really upset for the first time. \\n\\nI have fenced for fun and semi-competitively for about 2 years now. It's something that I'm very passionate about and love. For those who know nothing about fencing, there are three different types: epee, foil, and sabre. Each has slightly different rules, target areas, and ways to score on the opponent. I fence epee, and today I was going with a friend to an all sabre practice.\\n\\nI went there, I felt immediately out of my league, didn't like the coach although I loved the fencers, and starting struggling after my 3rd bout. Everything  I was using just started to hurt: my wrist, fingers, ankles, elbows. I still kept going because I felt like I'd get judged if I had stopped and it was a great opportunity that I would have missed, but I should have. \\n\\nI was miserable. I didn't know how to deal with it. I spent most of the time on the verge of tears and trying not to let other people see it. I wish that I had had the prednisone, but I hadn't gotten or filled the prescription since they only order it as needed. I'm calling tomorrow and leaving a message to see if I can have a few on hand because I was 3 hours away and it all just hurt.\\n\\nI don't know how to handle this. At face value, Sjogren's doesn't seem so bad: dry mouth, dry eyes, whatever. But over the past couple of months the amount of joint pain has increased making it harder and harder to do what I love. Some people noticed because at one point, my friend got me an immobilizing wrist brace, which was great because I couldn't move it, but I can't find a way that I feel comfortable describing what's going on when they ask if I hurt myself. \\n\\nI just feel like all I did was come off as a poor sport, I'm in pain, and I'm not really happy right now.\\n\\nSorry if this is confusing, it all just happened and I don't feel like editing.\",\n",

       " \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nSorry if this is long, I felt it would be best to describe my problems thoroughly. I'm just curious about some problems I've been having for a little over the past year that have been driving me wild and if it could possibly be related to sjogrens. Some of these problems began after having a Septoplasty about a year ago so I have no idea if they could be related to that.\\n\\nEdit: If it is helpful at all, I am a 21 year old male living in the Midwest of the US\\n\\nDryness related symptoms:\\n\\n* **Dry eyes:** This one I've actually had as long as I can remember. It isn't very severe but I find it get's worse in the winter and is at its worse when I'm in public walking around for an extended period of time and when I first wake up in the morning (if i don't use eye drops first thing in the morning it feels like there's shards of glass in my eyes). I had Lasik about 4 months ago and a very common side effect is dry eyes but surprisingly I've actually noticed a slight improvement in my dry eyes since getting it.\\n* **Extremely** **dry throat:** This one is almost unbearable. I will wake up every morning with the back of my throat completely barren, 0 moisture. It hurts very bad but thankfully get's better if I take a hot shower and inhale the steam.  It also happens less frequently at random times during the day.\\n* **Dry mouth:** This one is also not very severe and isn't as frequent as the others. My mouth will sometimes become dry and will not improve no matter how much water I drink. Between this and the dry throat I am almost always consuming liquids.\\n* **Dry nose:** I often wake up with dried blood in my nose\\n* **Dry skin:** I have to moisturize daily, especially my arms, hands, and face.\\n\\nI have tried many humidifiers, none of which help at all. My home even has a humidifier built into the heater/AC.\\n\\nEdit: For the mouth/throat related symptoms, I feel it is worth mentioning I have trouble with tonsil stones so that could be the cause.\\n\\nOther symptoms:\\n\\n* **Mild Raynaud's Syndrome:** This also started directly after my surgery. Last winter, completely out of the blue, my fingers began turning solid white whenever I got cold. It was only about 3 of my fingers. This winter, it hasn't been as severe. My fingers have not turned white but my hands are cold 90% of the time and go numb.\\n* **Joint/Muscle pain:** These aren't new symptoms either. I get debilitating pain in my elbow and knee joints along with pain in my arm muscles. It happens fairly infrequently though, maybe once a week. I have no joint swelling.\\n* **Fatigue:** Have very little energy and often feel tired despite having not done anything.\\n* **Post Nasal drip:** Ever since my septoplasty I have had globs of snot pouring down the back of my throat. I spit up probably 10-15 loogies a day. It's also annoying because due to the dryness of my throat they often become dried and stuck to the back of my throat causing discomfort.\\n\\nI recently had a lot of blood work done due to the joint/muscle pain and fatigue, some related to autoimmune disorders (mostly pertaining to Rheumatoid arthritis). Nothing seems to indicate any autoimmune dysfunction.\\n\\n* **ANA:** Negative\\n* **ESR:** 2 (range <15)\\n* **C-Reactive Protein:** .4 (range <8)\\n* **CCP Antibody IGG:** <16 (range <20)\\n\\nWould these symptoms be a strong case for sjogrens and is it a possibility despite the blood work? None of my symptoms are very debilitating, they all seems somewhat mild but are very annoying. I would appreciate any insight you have to offer.\",\n",

No joke. 10 days of antibiotics for a staff infection in my submandibular glands lead to thrush.

That let to a Sjogrens diagnosis. My bloodwork wasn’t positive for the ANA markers but my aPS/PT Igm was crazy high. I’m kind of freaking out. I had no idea that inflammation was happening so what else is being damaged in my body? I don’t know what all of this together looks like or what that high IgM number means.

I couldn\\'t see anything and would rub them incessantly (bad, I know) for days until it would go away.  They would swell up and look like I had been hit in the face.  No amount of moisturizing drops would help.  It was terrible!  I assumed it was because my contacts were irritating my eyes, but it persisted to a degree even after having LASIK.  (When I had the LASIK, my eye doctor was struck by just how dry my eyes were.  He put in punctal plugs, aka tear duct plugs to help keep the moisture in.  That has helped tremendously but, *boy*, was it unpleasant to have those 8\" needles going into my eyes)!  :O\\n\\n**TEETH**\\n\\nIn the last 6-7 years or so, I\\'ve started to develop cavities along the gumline of my back teeth despite brushing daily and flossing regularly.  My mouth is often bone dry despite using Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash and drinking tons of water.  These cavities seem to spread much faster than the kind that form on the top of the teeth, causing me to require several extractions.  I never used to get these gumline cavities in the past until about 7 years ago; now they\\'re the only kind I get.  I do eat a lot of sweets as a side effect of my medication, so I\\'m sure that contributes somewhat.  \\n\\n**SKIN**\\n\\nIn the last 2-3 years, my scalp has become incredibly dry as well.  It was always oily due to my super-fine and oily hair, but now it\\'s dry and full of large dandruff flakes.  My hair stylist actually thought the dandruff was lice until I explained that it wasn\\'t.  I\\'ve never been so humiliated!  Aargh!  \\n\\n**OTHER SYMPTOMS**\\n\\nDuring this 7-10 year time frame, a few other worrying symptoms have cropped up.  Vaginal dryness being one of them, but also total loss of sex drive (due to vaginal dryness? Or not?  I\\'m not sure).  My abdomen has become bloated and I\\'ve gained weight I can\\'t seem to lose no matter what I do.  And I\\'ve always had \"irritable bladder\" aka burning caused by certain substances like caffeine & not drinking enough water.  All my blood tests & routine checkups come out normal.      \\n\\n**POSSIBLE CAUSES**\\n\\nI know these sound like definite Sjogren\\'s symptoms, and maybe they are, but there are some other things that could be muddying the waters.  \\n\\nFirst, I live in a desert climate that is sunny 360 days a year and gets about 1/2 inch of rain per year...if that.  Summer temps get to 120 degrees regularly.  In short, it\\'s hot and dry here, unlike the place I grew up.  Some of these symptoms began when I moved here, such as the dry eye flare ups.\\n\\nSecondly, I take a lot of medications that can cause dryness as a side effect.  Here are just a few that come to mind:  dicyclomine, oxycodone, propylhexedrine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine succinate, cannabis & Prozac.  Most of these are taken daily or semi-daily for medical conditions.\\n\\n______________________________________________\\n\\nI know everyone\\'s symptoms are somewhat different, but how much of this resonates with you Sjogren\\'s folks?  Did your symptoms set in over a long period, or did you just wake up with the disease?

       " 'Primary vs secondary- Sjögren’s is usually classified by a clinician as either primary or secondary. Primary Sjögren’s occurs by itself and secondary Sjögren’s occurs when another connective tissue disease is present.  Both are systemic diseases, meaning they can affect many systems in the body, and they occur with about equal frequency. The primary form causes early and gradually progressive decreased function in the lacrimal and salivary glands, and can include a variety of extraglandular conditions. The secondary form occurs in people who already have another autoimmune connective tissue disease, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These people then develop dry eyes or dry mouth.

Everything was negative (although there has been some confusion with my thyroid - it was underactive, now it's normal, and we're retesting next week).\\n\\nI initially went to the doctor because I thought I had oral thrush - I had white patches, dry mouth, some minor itchiness. It turned out NOT to be oral thrush. To be honest I still don't know what it is - I'm going to a dental specialist on the 25th and will hopefully find out then. Nobody has been able to explain the dry mouth, though. I've been dealing with dry mouth for about a year now, sometimes better, sometimes worse (has been worse lately). I don't know if that is related to the white patches or not? An ENT and my dentist thought the white patches could be food related, possibly a new allergy, or somehow due to my fissured tongue. They couldn't explain the dry mouth. I was not taking antibiotics or anything else until recently (taking nortriptaline now, which might explain why it's been worse?). I have a dry cough sometimes as well, usually in the mornings.\\n\\nI've also been seeing my doctor because I've been experiencing fatigue for at least 7 months. It has improved over the last couple weeks for no apparent reason, which has been nice, but I'm worried it's going to come back, and I wish I had an answer for why I was experiencing it in the first place.\\n\\nI've also had mild joint pain in my hands for as long as I can remember.

This is the only thing that seems to explain my dry mouth, fatigue, and joint issues, but I'm not a doctor or any sort of health professional so I really don't know.

In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899-1986), an ophthalmologist in Jönköping, Sweden, observed a patient with low secretions from the lacrimal (which produce tears) and salivary (which produce saliva) glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca to describe the symptom of dry eyes (Keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, most of whom were postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 50 of whom also had arthritis. His subsequent follow-up conference trips pertaining to his paper led to an international interest in Sjogren’s syndrome.

Briefly mentioning that I have a very dry mouth and  must get up several times every night to drink, I asked if this could be caused by some medications I used to take some years ago, which had that as a side effect. Doc said no, that they would not have that effect years after I stopped taking them, and that the only disease she knew that could cause this was Sjogren's, but that she did not think I have any other symptoms. We go through common symptoms and I also have dry eyes (I am constantly having pain in my right eye, she told me maybe a year ago that this is due to dryness), I have a dry and sore throat; I don't think I have joint pain, but I do have other bodily pain, e.g. chronic shoulder pain and tendonitis, have issues related to digestion. Blood tests have recently shown some changes related to my lungs and white blood cells (if I understand the latter correctly). The worst thing though is none of the above, but that I feel so tired, both physically and mentally. Googling for symptoms in the past, Sjogren's did come up a few times, but I don't think I really wanted to seriously entertain the thought. Now, however, I am quite sure I have it.  \\n\\n\\nWas working on my MSc thesis, about 5 years ago, when I remember things changing (I am now in my mid-thirties). I didn't notice any dryness in my mouth, as I was on those medications that already gave this as a side effect, I just remember going from being healthy and active to becoming very tired. Had been tired and depressed before, so my strategy was to take it easy for a while, until my energy levels would become normal again, but it's like they just never did. While waiting for things to change I became seriously delayed with my thesis, in the end I just had to force myself to get it done, it was a daily struggle. Since then I have been working as a PhD candidate for a few years, it has been hard. I don't have the drive and motivation I used to have, I can't really work for 8 hours anymore (because of the flexibility of my position I have tried to work less on weekdays, but also work on Sunday's). It's like there are not enough hours in the day (even though I mostly just work, make dinner and walk my dog). I used to run 5-6 times a week before I started to change (feel sick), and have recently started again (progressing very slowly since I have chronic tendonitis). While I do feel better about myself and my body, I found myself frequently Googling if it is normal to feel so tired after exercise. Usually I come home feeling good, but wanting to go to sleep.  \\n\\n\\nI have to switch jobs soon, have been dreading working a 9 to 5 job, and now I will also need to spend some time finishing my PhD on my free time. Want it to work out, but I am anxious about the future (e.g., can I complete my PhD, will I be on sick leave a lot, will I end up on partial disability?).  I own a house with my partner who is a student, so I need to work full time. Ideally I'd like to run my own company so I can have more flexible working hours (I have been thinking about this for the past year), but I don't think it will be possible for at least a few years.\\n\\nI know I need to go through the tests and get an official diagnosis, so I guess that's what's next. Of course I can not be 100 % certain that I have Sjogren's, but I feel quite certain. I don't know how long it will take for me to get a diagnosis, but probably some time (the public health care system in my county is not known for its efficiency). Being tired and under a lot of pressure had left me with a negative outlook on life. I had recently started to feel better, but it is now hard to accept that I could be chronically ill. Will do my best not to overthink this while I am still waiting to be diagnosed. Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading. Any feedback is also appreciated.\",\n",

I am also cold all the time unless the temperature gets above 80 degrees. This started more recently a few months ago.\\n\\nI may also be having problems with my throat which just started. I don't seem to have a problem swallowing but I am getting some random sharp sensations in my throat that has been going on for about a month.\\n\\nDefecation can be painful and there is often a lot of blood on the toilet paper and sometimes in the water.

Some time after that the pain and blood started. I wonder if my body is not producing mucin in the digestive tract. I've told my primary care physician about all these problems. He referred me to an ophthalmologist and they had no idea what was causing the eye problem. \\n\\nI've also had fibromylagia, for  over 10 years which includes jaw and neck pain and a lot of other pain and unusual neurological sensations and too many other symptoms to go into here. These sensations feel like numbness below the eyes and wet water sensations in the legs or other places. I also have ringing in the ears.\\n\\nI had a metal wire fixed retainer made of stainless steel put in my mouth about 15 years ago when the health problems started. I just recently realized that the nickel in there could cause an immune problem causing fibromyalgia and other problems so I had it removed about a month ago. I'll see if any of my problems go away.\\n\\nI'm scheduled to see my primary care doctor again to follow up in a few weeks. How do these symptoms, especially the digestive ones relate to Sjogrens and your symptoms and history?\\n\\nThank You\",\n",

I did a PFT/CPEX (pulmonary function test/cardiopulmonary exercise test) and the breathing capacity still came up around 40%.

I had some blood tests at the eye hospital a few years back (don’t actually have the results so don’t know which tests but I know they were looking for Sjogrens) which were negative but obviously false negatives occur! \\n\\nI have appointments with both my consultants in the next month and really want to push for further testing as my eyes are getting worse but don’t know how to bring it up without being treated as a hypochondriac. Any advice much appreciated. ',\n",
       " \" \\n\\nBackground:\\n\\n32F, Dx with Primary Sjogren's in 2016, also have PCOS w IR.\\n\\nWhen I was initially dx, I had bloodwork done and had a weak positive ANA but it had a cytoplasmic speckled pattern. I had a positive result for SSB (repeated many, many times) and elevated C3. I went on a steroid taper for the elevated C3.\\n\\nSince diagnosis, I went on plaquenil 400 mg a day and recently gabapentin for muscle spasms and migraines.\\n\\nThis fall, I started having episodes where I would wake up in the middle of the night with a horrible stomach cramp that I couldn't speak through, run to the bathroom, and basically leave a toilet bowl full of blood. This happened to me about 3 times. I also have an ongoing issue with fissures, which my colorectal surgeon says looks like a pattern of autoimmune issues b/c they are on the anterior wall which is very unusual unless you have autoimmune issues in that arena.\\n\\nBasically my GI/ colorectal person suspects lupus and a rare complication called bowel ischemia. My Rheumy saw me at the end of December and thought more like IBD, which runs in my family. I have been limited in my diet lately- a lot of things make me have stomach cramps or diharrhea. I have been basically eating pasta, chicken broth with white rice, rotisserie chicken, very cooked canned vegetables, and occasional mashed potatoes. Anything else causes me distress.\\n\\nMy Rheumy did bloodwork in late December but seemed unconcerned but she ordered more than normal. Anytime I have had an abnormal lab (high C3, other issues) her nurse just calls me and tells me what prescription they've phoned in, answers questions, etc. I got a call today that I have to go in and see my rheumy at the soonest possible appointment and essentially that they aren't really going to tell me what's happening or post my results to the portal. Now I have to wait until Monday. I am super pissed and very concerned. I wish they would just tell me what's wrong and then I can come in to follow up. They don't even call if labs are normal so I know something has to be off.\\n\\nHave you ever had this experience? Am I super off base to be pissed and (very) worried?\",\n",

       " 'Hey all, I\\'m new here.  I may have Sjogren\\'s but I have not been definitively diagnosed yet, I\\'m still in the very early stages.  I just saw my optometrist last week and while this disorder has been on my radar, I purposely avoided mentioning due to being wrong in the past and just described my symptoms to her.  Thankfully she volunteered the possibility of Sjogren\\'s with instructions to see a dentist before coming back to coordinate with her again.  So, that was a huge relief.\\n\\nHere\\'s the short list of what\\'s going on with me: dry, gritty eyes including waking up in the middle of the night feeling like my face is packed full of cotton; dry, itchy nose; history of apthous ulcers and dry mouth, which seem to be worsening; issues swallowing food and pills, voice hoarseness (I used to love to sing, lately I\\'m finding it painful); angular and possibly exfoliative cheilitis; GI issues including dyspepsia, gastritis, IBS, gastroparesis, GERD (these have all been diagnosed by my GI doctor); worsening asthma and increasing respiratory infections despite zero IgE-mediated allergies.  A few years ago I began having gallbladder attacks and had it taken out, only to find it was inflamed but acalculous.  I have a mental health history as well (mostly depression and anxiety) which doesn\\'t seem to help anything.\\n\\nMy frustration with all of this is that most doctors I\\'ve seen only treat one system for symptoms. I get that, they\\'re experts in a specific field and have so many patients to handle.  And while I can\\'t say I like all of my doctors, I do genuinely believe they don\\'t write me off.  They\\'ve put me through a ringer of tests, but everything comes back normal or inconclusive.  I just don\\'t understand why I feel so bad if everything is within normal parameters.\\n\\nAnyway, I apologize for that wall of text.  I\\'m trying not to let this get me down but it wears on you after a while, and I\\'m honestly afraid of pursuing this only to be told, yet again, that the bulk of it is in my mind.  I have a young family I need to be there for, I\\'m back in school for a health science program, and I live an active lifestyle.  I don\\'t want to let this, whatever it is, defeat me.\\n\\nSo, I guess in addition to being a vent, I had some questions.  1) I had angular cheilitis several years ago that wouldn\\'t heal for about 3 months.  I attributed it at the time to vitamin deficiency from a vegan diet and haven\\'t had issues since returning to a more standard diet.  More recently though, I seem to have \"flares\" of painful exfoliative cheilitis and patches of dry numbness or red painful patches on my tongue.  Can these issues flare and remit, or are they pretty much constant once you develop them?  2) I became pregnant with my youngest following a bad \"flare\" 2.5 years ago.  She seems to be a healthy almost 2-year-old today.  She had no issues at birth and hasn\\'t had anything pop up in any well checks.  Should I be at all concerned about heart block at this point?  3) How much does family history play into this?  My paternal grandmother had plaque psoriasis and my father may as well.  Additionally my maternal grandmother complained frequently of dry eyes and mouth, but I don\\'t believe she was ever diagnosed with any autoimmune disorder, so perhaps it was just genetic or age-induced dry eye.\\n\\nWow, that was a lot.

My health/mental health and life is in shambles right now, and I am about 100% sure I am suffering from autoimmune disease. Let me preface that I am female and just turned 30 years old back in January. Also, this probably will be a lengthy post, as this has been an ongoing struggle.\\n\\nFirst off, I am not sure which auto immune disease, however, I am suspecting Lupus, Hashimoto's, or Sjogren's. My symptoms include: neck stiffness, neck pain, particularly under my jaw and under where my ears connect, sometimes the pain is severe, sometimes it's a nagging type of pain, also it is usually accompanied by heat and a burning sensation, in which my face and neck area will get hot, to the point I have to splash water on my face or press something cold. My face stays red, which people comment on, however, I am also pale and have freckles, I have redness on many areas of my body. I also get a low grade fever that accompanies this. I am also experiencing joint stiffness in my hands, feet, and one of elbows. The joint stiffness is mostly in my finger joints and toe joints, particularly when I am laying down for bed. Also, when I I lay down to bed, I am experiencing horrible calf and foot cramps, and man they are annoying and painful! The cramps are more recent and more frequent. I am having some stomach issues, as well. For example, I used to have a very normal bowel movements and solid, but I'm now experiencing constipation issues and a tugging feeling or full on my right side. I also previously suffered from debilitating menstrual periods. I once had a period last nearly 5 months, another for 3 months. Until recently I battled through this for years and years, with no luck. I am now on Nuva Ring and so far, they are controlled and normal. I am also having skin issues, which I believe to be from a compromised immune system. I ended up in the ER last year with swollen, red, itchy, and painful calves and feet. The  ER doctor (who was an absolute nightmare) said it was cellutis and gave me nothing and did nothing, sent me home after my bloodwork came back normal. OH, how could I almost forget..the horrendously dry skin! I have always been on the dry side, but damn, my skin is a desert! I also exfoliate like crazy..so much skin! These are most of my physical symptoms, although, I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. \\n\\nI am also experiencing (feel like I have typed that word 100 times just in this post, sorry) mental health problems, which I have dealt with since my early teens, but nothing has been done till recently, which leaves me where I'm at now. Last year, I finally found a wonderful, yet expensive GYN and have had bloodwork, pap smear, and vaginal ultrasounds performed. Everything has come back clear  (including all past paps). I was for certain that everything I have been slowly dealing with and accumulating was stemming from gynecological issues, now I am not. I am seeing a new GP and had more routine bloodwork done last week and was given Paxil and Atenolol, my BP was high. Before this past year, I have not had a steady GP, only a GYN. I have told  my GP my issues, but what do I specifically need to do? I also do NOT have insurance, my boyfriend/fiancé of 10 years is pretty much taking care of the both of us, as things have hit such a head that I am unable to work and have put grad school on hold.

I've tried cutting out gluten, dairy, caffine, all medications beside the ones for dry mouth and although it helps with the ibs I'm still really dried out.  I've gone to a lot of doctors and they tested me for sjogren's and although they said my test showed inflammation in my salivary glands they don't think it's sjogren's and they prescribed me salagen and evoxac and it helps sometimes but I still feel miserable from being so dry.

I noticed this after having slept with a fan blowing in my direction for just under a week, but the dry throat persists.

Other than that I haven't felt like my eyes were particularly dry and I don't experience the stinging any other time during the day.\\n\\nThe only other thing is that a couple months ago I noticed a painless, pea-sized bump in front of my ear where the parotid gland would be.

Also the sandy feeling I feel so similiar with. Also yellow/green fluid stuck in the eyes? Still have bit dry eyes after not smoking, but no more sandy eyeburns, use oculotect only when waking up.\\n\\nAlso, I drink a lot of water. I need at least 0.3-0.5 litre before I go to bed to satisfy my mouth. Sleep quite bad, always feel tired when I wake up.\\n\\nAnother thing is my fatigue. I sort of have bursts of fatigue? Mostly at 15:00-16:00 or after lunch I just want to lay in bed and really have to lay dwn. Goes hand in hand with very dry mouth.\\n\\nFor the rest I do not really feel muscle pain or in joints. Not noticably.  Also had eczema sinds  birth basically. Since I quit smoking way less redness in face but still a little bit. And stretch marks everywhere even though I gained just 6 kgs.\\n\\n Except for my eyes everything seems mild compared to you guys, so I wonder if this could be it.

I am wondering if anyone out there has experience with gym routines and Sjögren’s, or just staying physically active in general while managing the disorder. \\n\\nIdeally 3-4 times a week, I try to do ~30 minutes of cardio (elliptical, stair stepper, jump-roping seem to be the most doable), and like to do moderate strength training and toning (usually using cables/machines, as free weights often cause too much pain in my hands). My fitness goals are fairly modest— I’m not looking to bulk up into a body builder or anything, just trying to stay in shape, keep my heart healthy, and ward off the fatigue that often follows sustained periods of inactivity. \\n\\nI’ve tried consulting my rheumatologist (who is never very interested in answering my questions), as well as personal trainers at my gym (who have been incredibly responsive and compassionate, but just don’t know enough about the disorder to really help).

I’m dealing with my hands going numb a lot and shooting pains in my arms. Swelling in my right foot. Tight shoes. The worst is trying to blink in the morning, my eyelids feel like sandpaper’s against my eyeballs. How did we end up this way! I take Plaquenil and my muscles aren’t as sore to the touch as they used to be. My shoulders and neck were the worst, hot to the touch. I lived in agony most of last year, I realized a connection between a severe headache, red eyes, fatigue and muscle soreness and weakness. I was down for about a month. I was so sick. Finally got a damn diagnosis. Turns out all these years there was an explanation for fibromyalgia. I’m relieved to know I wasn’t imagining it! Hang tight and know you are not alone!

It’s been 4 years since my diagnosis, I’m 29 now, & I’ve struggled greatly with this (I’m a very seasoned baker & home chef) but when I eat these things I’m guaranteed parotid swelling for at least 2 days. It does still happen occasionally even at my strictest, usually in the morning if I go too long without eating or drinking anything after waking. Hot compresses & massages help with pain. I usually just try to force myself to produce saliva when it happens, unless the pain is really too much to handle. \\n\\nMy biggest issues are dry eyes, fatigue, dehydration, & joint pain. I currently don’t see a doctor, I haven’t found one that I like. I control my symptoms through diet, exercise, & stress management. Good sleep is really important too. \\n\\nI also take A LOT of supplements. Like, probably way too many. The one supplement I cannot live without is TheraTears Omega 3 tablets. If I forget to take them in the morning, I definitely notice throughout the day. I’ve taken other fish oil/omega 3 supplements that are more potent/from whole food sources/organic/etc, but for some reason I’ve seen the best results with these. I also use the Thermalon Dry Eye Compress twice a day. I saw it recommended on here & decided to give it a try, the combination of the fish oil tablets & the compress  has really helped with the discomfort of dry eyes.  Some other supplements I highly recommend: Vitamin D is also a life saver, most people with autoimmune conditions are extremely deficient. Collagen & turmeric are really good for inflammation, I drink a golden milk latte every night before bed. \\n\\nStaying hydrated is extremely important. I drink over a gallon of water a day & my thirst never feels quenched. I live in South Florida so that doesn’t help either. My electrolytes are always low too, coconut water helps with this.\\n\\nAs far as work, I’ll be a SAHM for another year, so I can’t give advice there, unfortunately. I will give this added advice that you didn’t ask for,  it really helps to have someone you can relate with. The hardest part of all this for me really has been that no one understands. It sucks being so young dealing with a chronic illness. I get so much shit from family members & friends who just don’t understand when I’m having a flare that I’m not being lazy or bitchy, I’m just experiencing severe pain & fatigue. A lot of them are unsympathetic the my dietary restrictions too. I’ve had a couple flares due to family members lying about ingredients at family functions. So, that can add to stress which leads to inflammation & flares. My mom was also diagnosed with a few autoimmune diseases at 24, I confide in her a lot. My husband is really supportive too. \\n\\nAnother bit of unsolicited advice: stay on top of your dental care. It was actually a very perceptive dentist that led to me get diagnosed. I had severe gum disease at 24 years old & my dentist was determined to figure out why because I didn’t consume a lot of sugar & my teeth themselves were in great shape. She did noticed my saliva was a weird consistency & after a few days of research she called me suggesting I get tested for Sjorgrens. After a deep cleaning of my gums, I now go for cleanings every 3 months. I oil pull every morning & brush with activated charcoal. My gum are now back to normal & healing. \\n\\nSo yeah! I guess that’s my take, sorry it’s so lengthy. Good luck! You’ll get through this. ❤️\\n\\nEdited to add this: idk if you’re into alternative medicine, but my sister in law is a Chinese medicine practitioner & suggested I try acupuncture. She had a patient with sicca that found relief from her symptoms with acupuncture, but that was not the case for me. Due to my chronic dehydration, both times were extremely painful. I’m totally into alternative medicine & as mentioned, I’ve had great results from lifestyle & dietary changes, but just use caution & do your research if going down that route.',\n",
       " 'I started getting parotid swelling at 18 and it got progressively worse until I was 21/22. Finally i figured out that it was diet related. I eliminated many processed foods, gluten, and most sources of dairy from my diet, started drinking more water, started exercising, and did not have the swelling again until about 2 years ago (I’m 38, so went about 15 years without having it). I have it off and on now but not near as bad as back then...I’ll just feel a slight sense of fullness under my ear for a day or 2, and then it’ll go away. For me, touching it and rubbing it makes it worse. If I feel anything there, I just very gently rub some coconut oil with essential oils on the skin along my jaw and then don’t touch it for the rest of the day. The oil seems to loosen things up, and isn’t as irritating as massaging and messing with it.\\n\\nDo you wear blue blocker glasses at work? Can you adjust the light on your computer screen? I think it’s fine to tell work you have an autoimmune disease and need to attend certain doc appts. You can explain it to them, but be prepared that they still may not really understand or relate. Unless they have a similar illness, or have a close family member or friend who has, a lot of people just don’t get it. If you feel your job isn’t a good fit, then I’d look for a different one that might be better suited for you. If you’re able to work though, I would. Having the structure of a job is not a bad thing. You need something flexible enough that you can take time to go to appts, and also with hours that allow you to come home and make yourself dinner and get to bed on time...no 50 hour work weeks.',\n",

The sports mouth guards  just fall out as I sleep, but they are a lot cheaper and might work for you.\\nThe really strange thing that actually does seem to help is ear drops.  I think mine are for swimmers although motion sickness ones work too.  I started using them for vertigo/dizziness, but they somehow seem to help with jaw pain?

If your dr doesn't diagnose you based on negative lab results, you can either point out research showing that [bloodwork isn't always an indicator](https://labtestsonline.org/conditions/sjogren-syndrome), ask for other tests (such as a [lip biopsy](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/11/15/lip-biopsy-sensitive-diagnostic-criteria-sjogrens-syndrome-study/) or [Schirmer tear test](https://www.healthline.com/health/schirmers-test)), or you could always see a different provider that is more open.\\n\\nAs far as tooth decay, that is an issue with Sjogren's (dry mouth). I'd recommend adding a daily fluoride rinse, as well as getting fluoride treatment at your dentist. The dentist normally only offers the flouride treatment for kids, so you may need to ask about it.

Many people with SS don’t do well with gluten, even if they don’t have celiac. My first symptoms were peripheral nerve issues, and off and on swelling of the parotid when I was 19/20. I always had bad tension headaches as well, but I don’t know if that was related...maybe. No one knew what was wrong with me at the time, and I never even saw a rheumatologist. That was before AI disease was as big as it is now. I was just a mystery case. I went to an acupuncturist, since my regular doctor and neurologist were no help to me whatsoever and just ran pointless nerve studies on me and told me I had pinched nerves. The acupuncturist told me to stop eating bread (wheat) and to eat rice instead. I took his recommendation, and then cleaned up my whole diet and started exercising too. I did still eat wheat every once in awhile, but it was usually in homemade bread and small quantities. I stopped eating pizza, fast food, I stopped drinking, and stopped eating sugar. I did not have a thing wrong with me for 15 years. Now, I’m 38 and dryness issues have creeped up on me the last couple years, and a rheumatologist says I have this disease. I’ve been living with it in the periphery these years, and wish it would have stayed away for good 😐 So, we’ll see where I end up too, as I have a lot of years left as well. \\n\\nI do think there’s hope though. My husband has had ulcerative colitis for 10 years (while I was well, he was sick) and is in remission after going on the keto diet. He has taken imuran for several years, which def helped, but after a year of keto, he had a normal colonoscopy for the first time this year. Sorry for the novel, but just saying, never give up! I think medication and diet should be used together. I completely disagree with people who say AI cannot be helped with diet, because I’ve seen it. But I also think meds are beneficial. Good luck...25 is still so young, your body will respond quickly to any positive changes! \\n\\nEta: Also, I do wonder what role hormones have to play on SS. Almost all of my well years, I was either on birth control, pregnant (best I’ve ever felt), or breastfeeding.

My left knee, calf and foot when numb for about two months last year right before I found out I had Sjogrens. I suffered with Hashimotos Disease, (autoimmune hypothyroidism l) since I was nine. I was always very sick. Fatigue, recurrent strep throat, pharyngitis, laryngitis, chronic otitis media (ear infections) had to have multiple tube placements and those issues lead to 90% autoimmune hearing loss in my left ear. After being diagnosed with Hashimotos there were times I would be in stores and felt like I was going to pass out. Anytime I went into stores with flourescent lighting my eyes turned bright red. This is a symptom I suffer now, with Sjogrens and I wonder if I’ve had Sjogrens for a long time. Every tooth I have had a filling in it. I had all of them worked on after having my son at 17. A mouth full of metal dental cavities is terrible for you too. I’ve been to every kind of doctor. I have severe constipation. GERD. Recurrent lung infections. Misdiagnosed pink eye before I knew I had Sjogrens. Antibiotic drops did nothing so I now realize I needed a steroid because my eye was so swollen that I look like a monster. I’ve been tested for everything. Even celiac. My son is 14 now but back when he was 2 and 3 I suffered severe abdominal pain that put me in the ER many times and they could never figure out what it was except one time they found it was pancreatitis. Asked me if I drank a lot of alcohol and I do not. I believe now it was autoimmune. Around that time I was really sick and was tested for the bird flu that was going around and it came back negative. I now believe it was a flare up. I’ve been tested for Lyme disease, I’ve had nerve conduction tests, MRI’s anything, you name it. I have a problem with dehydration and feel I never can drink enough water. I’ve suffered many UTI’s and as of recently I will get what feels like a UTI, but it will pass. I think I get temporary inflammation in my bladder and urethra. I’ve had a stressful week and am having a flare up with a headache, severe fatigue and blurry vision. I have had an SSD application ongoing for four years and was just denied. I am bipolar i, with obsessive compulsive tendencies, PTSD, intermittent explosive disorder, anxiety, panic attacks, and an unspecified personality disorder, they told me my Sjogrens and other issues aren't severe enough however if you read through the disability guidelines when you have two autoimmune disorders that lead to other issues like chemical imbalances in the brain that can cause anxiety and bipolar you are supposed to be approve. See the problem was I had an asshole psychologist that I met one time and he noted I appear to have nothing wrong with me. He totally fucked me. So I have to refile for SSI and I will be approve but am screwed out of 4 years of back pay. No one wants to fight it because there are other things in my record that do not look good like things that happened when I was manic- got into drugs - self medicated my own pain - things like that. It's been a very hard road and it's hurtful for people to point out like there was a picture on my Facebook that I cooked dinner. I do have days where I am able to do things like this but still struggle. Before I found out about the Sjogrens I literally could not function or move from a chair. The headaches, the eye pain and redness and blurry vision, the muscle pain and weakness, thank God for Prednisone! I see a new doctor here in my city we have an entire network of Autoimmune specialists. (Pittsburgh had some of the best doctors) I am also seeing a new rheumatologist. I am constantly judged because of my age (31) and prior history. You know the history where I kind of gave up on how shitty I've felt my whole life on top of traumatic things that happened which led me to toxic relationships that added to my PTSD. I also get a light buttery fly rash on my face. I get short of breath too and I believe that I have lupus and I am hoping my new Dr gets to the bottom of it. Today is bad, my vision is blurry can't keep my eyes open, no appetite, soreness in my left hand and wrist with shooting pains, and I can't find my damn glasses. Ugh!

Know your activity limits and try to stick to them. For me, I experience a form of what I\\'m guessing is post-exertional malaise. If I do too much one day, I might suddenly \"crash\" partway through the day. Or, I might not actually feel the fatigue until a day or two later, where I can barely get out of bed. Planning for this and trying to space out activities instead of cramming them into one day helps a lot.\\n\\nGive yourself permission to take breaks, even if they seem ridiculous. I have been known to sit on display chairs at Target for good chunks of time while shopping, or sit on a curb while taking a walk, or turn my breaks at work into shut-eye breaks with noise cancelling headphones on (set the music to a playlist of something calming and then something that will wake you up at the end). \\n\\nIf you are able, use services to give yourself a break. Uber and Lyft if you are too sleepy to drive, Uber Eats or pizza delivery if you really can\\'t cook, Instacart for groceries, etc. I use these pretty sparingly but they are a great resource. \\n\\nI also tone down my activities in general, or find ways to make things less fatiguing. One really good one - use a chair. I have a chair next to my bathroom counter, and I sit while doing makeup or other beauty/self care things. I have been known to bring my chair in the kitchen, and sit to prep and cook (a stool or drafting chair is best for high counters). I also sit while putting away laundry. \\n\\nAnother trick is to combine low-energy days with calm work days. I work a desk job as well as a work-from-home side job. On my fatigued days I will work on my side job when I get little spurts of energy. I keep my laptop on a little cart next to my bed and work completely laying down, with several pillows propping up various body parts.\\n\\nI also adjusted my hobbies. I used to love to go on very long walks, but I can\\'t handle this as much anymore. Instead, I take walks around my neighborhood, so I\\'m never too far from my house. It got boring, so I started playing Pokemon Go again to have something to look forward to while walking. \\n\\nI also play a lot of open-world video games, again usually while laying down. I keep a lot of water, eye drops, and a humidifier nearby. \\n\\nFine tuning your medication is important. For me, I have to take my medication an hour or two before bed, or they make it hard for me to get up in the morning. Also, take supplements if you need them. Fish oil has helped me a lot. Get a blood test to check out your vitamins and minerals and correct anything that might be low, like vitamin D.\\n\\nBe sure you\\'re staying hydrated however you can. Plain water doesn\\'t always do it for me, so I mix my own electrolyte drinks using lite salt (salt and potassium, it\\'s at the grocery store with other salts), magnesium (Natural Calm), and some flavoring like lemon juice or sugar free syrup (e.g. Raspberry Torani). I try to avoid excess sugar but sugar free Powerade is also really good.',\n",
       " \"To be honest, I know this isn't going to be able that everyone likes or can take, but I've just had to get a lot better at minimizing stress. \\n\\nFor me, a large part of that was quitting my very stressful job. For the foreseeable future I'm a house spouse and focusing on myself. I understand that I'm in an incredibly privileged position to be able to do that and that not everyone can or even wants to do that. I never thought that I wanted that for myself. My spouse and I had some very honest conversations about what was important to both of us and came to the conclusion that while the money and security that my job gave us was very nice the stress my job gave me far outweighed the benefits. \\n\\nSince quitting my fatigue has been far more manageable even though I definitely physically do more work than before. The mental and social load I was taking on at work was that high. I also get the freedom to move things around to accommodate good days and bad days. \\n\\nAnother thing that I've had to do is be really circumspect about the extraneous things that I allow myself to take on. For example I'm a volunteer at a local nonprofit, and while I feel like I'm qualified to do more than I'm doing now I simply know that if I take on more than what I'm already doing then I won't be able to do it reliably and still take care of myself. I have to reserve extra time to take care of myself that I don't always need but sometimes is essential.\\n\\nThe last big thing is that I try to swim at least twice a week.

       " 'I can echo what most other folks have said for the most part.\\n\\nPacing (have you read about \"spoon theory\"?) is key. The next biggest thing is forgiving yourself. \\n\\nAs far as medications and supplements, try to avoid any that make you more fatigued. I have painful neuropathy on top of sjorgren\\'s. I\\'ve found that tramodol is effective to some degree, but it makes my fatigue so much worse. I had it almost under control between pacing and supplements, and that all went to hell when I started tramodol (and now I can\\'t stop it cold turkey because I\\'ve developed a dependence - it only took like 2 months!)\\n\\nBe aware of dysautonomia, its way more common in sjorgren\\'s folks than most people realize. Orthostatic intolerance and POTS can contribute to feelings of fatigue. You can boost your salt and potassium intake (if you can swing it try Nuun electrolyte tablets - take two in some juice sometime and see if it makes you feel any better - otherwise try gatorade, pedialyte, or just putting some sea salt in some juice and drinking it). If you read about it, and think you might have it, or find that electrolytes help, a tilt-table test is the best way to get a firm diagnosis. There are a few drugs that can affect your blood pressure that your doctor might prescribe that can help. I take florinef, its a hormone that makes your body hold onto salt, and it puts a minor dent in my sumptoms, when I remember to take enough extra salt.\\n\\nSo beyond that, when things are\\nreally bad, I take modafinil (provigil). Depending on your doctor and insurance (and where you are in the world) it might be easier or harder to get than something like adderal. I buy it without insurance at Costco (its like 45 bucks). The up side of it compared to typical ADHD drugs is that it doesn\\'t give you withdrawl symptoms. Its easy to take a day or two off or just take it as needed like I do. In fact, you can avoid tolerance buildup by taking frequent breaks (my doctor told me to take a day or two off every 7-10 days). Its weird stuff, so be careful with it, but it has a really good safety profile. Avoid other stimulants like caffeine if you can while on it - if I\\'m not careful I can end up with major insomnia (what\\'s weird about it is that its not insomnia in the sense of \"I\\'m frustrated because I\\'m tired but can\\'t sleep\" its more like \"sleep!\\nI don\\'t need no stinkin\\' sleep\").\\n\\nSupplements are my main defense against my autoimmune and pain-related fatigue. I take caffeine in the form of cold-press coffee concentrate I make myself (its my morning coffee, usually just need it once a day). I add l-theanine, it seems to \\'round out\\' the caffeine effects, makes things less jittery. \\n\\nAlong with that, I take B-12, NALT, magnesium l-threonate, and citicoline.

I tend to get so dry at night my mouth and  nose get inflamed and it wakes me up, or it triggers my sleep apnea. In either case my fatigue ends up being way worse in the morning. Sleeping with a humidifier helps a lot.\\n\\nAlso for sleep is magnesium.

I also sometimes get very weak so getting up is actually difficult because I don\\'t have the strength to. \\n\\nHere are some things that I\\'ve found that seem to help:\\n\\nGo to: Set two alarms. One for about an hour before your regular one. When the first one goes off, I wake up but I\\'m still stiff, weak, and tired.

I like Natural Calm.\\n- Potassium. You can use \"lite salt\" which is in with the table salt at most stores and is half potassium and half regular salt. Or a banana with breakfast.\\n- Muscle relaxer. I take a pretty low dose of Flexeril every night before bed and as needed during the day. It helps oodles with stiffness. \\n- Gentle stretching or yoga at night. I don\\'t do \"flows\" or anything complicated. I like the basic stretches where you hold poses. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube is really good, she has videos for lots of trouble areas.\\n- A gentle walk at night or early in the morning. Just take it slow and stretch as you go. \\n- Thicker blankets or even weighted blankets. I keep my room pretty cool and I have a fairly lightweight but thick duvet. Something about the weight of it pushing on me seems to help prevent me from tightening up. \\n- If you have a lot of stiffness in your back or shoulders, adjusting pillows and getting massages helps. Also watch your posture during the day. \\n- If the stiffness is in your legs, look at your footwear and consider something more supportive. Consider elevating your legs during the day, massaging them, or wearing compression socks. Depending on the underlying issue they can help in different ways.',\n",

People play off the symptoms but they don't realize how much it really affects us.  Luckily my wife saw the difference between my good days and bad days and encouraged me to see a doctor.

I'm not sure if it's the Sjogren's or another one of my conditions, but I definitely get something like post-exertional malaise (PEM), that comes on 1-2 days after really pushing myself. There are days when I wake up and I'm too weak to get out of bed. I also experience bad brain fog, to the level of confusion and not always making sense when I speak. My coworkers delight at how I type up extremely detailed notes on various tasks and processes and share them with everyone - but I rarely tell them the truth, that I need them to remember all the details of how to do my job.\\n\\nI tend to spend the whole weekend in bed or laying on the couch. Some weekends I will spend half the day out shopping where I'll walk quite a bit, but I usually don't tend to have the energy after a long work week to do much else.\\n\\nIn the past, I used to work multiple jobs and go to university. I would be out and about every day from 6 am to midnight, working my butt off. When I first was diagnosed with my first autoimmune condition, I just had no energy anymore and was having the weirdest symptoms. Later I was diagnosed with other conditions and I had to start pruning down my schedule and finding more flexible options to finally graduate a few years ago. I'm lucky and grateful that I was able to work something out, but I'm sad that I couldn't do everything I wanted to at the level of excellence I aspire to.\\n\\nAnyway, anecdotally, eating low-carb, drinking a ton of water, taking my medicine, getting enough sleep, and avoiding over-exerting myself (especially in hot environments), - trying not to get to the point where I'm sweating heavily and breathing very hard -allows me to have a good level of energy, where I can get quite a bit done. On good weeks, I try to go for a 2-3 mile walk 4-5 times per week and go to yoga 2-3 times per week. On really good weeks, I go for walks every day and go to the gym (yoga and strength classes) every day. For me, true cardio (running, spin class, ellipticals, etc.) is out (it can literally take me days or weeks to recover from the PEM), but I have pretty good endurance for less exhausting exercise, and I find that the more I do it, the better I feel and the more I can handle.\",\n",

Sjogren’s seems to be associated with Thrush, which is the rash many patients seem to suffer when chronic mouth dryness is an issue. \\n\\nThe gray discoloring could be caused by medication or even food dyes that don’t easily clear away because saliva isn’t being produced.\\n\\nI’m not a doctor, so I’m just repeating the culprits that I’ve read about while researching my own symptoms.\\n\\nIt’s great to ask your dentist about the issue, but you should have your doctor take a look at it and maybe culture it if they suspect fungal or bacterial infection. You can go to a walk-in clinic to get quicker answers to that problem. You don’t want to let infections get worse, because they will stick around for ages if you don’t nuke with the appropriate prescription. And they can get painful in time, so please get that checked as soon as possible.\\n\\nMy best advice to you is to sip water all day. Tiny sips help make up for the lost saliva, which can help with digestion, too. That’s a big problem for me in the long run, and you really don’t want to deal with paralyzed stomach/motility issues.

He simply had zero capacity to care for me and also had zero capacity to understand how much energy and caretaking he required to keep him functioning since he was our sole breadwinner.  Since the divorce I can see how much the marriage was preventing me from focusing on taking care of myself.  If you've been trying to see things from his point of view for 5 years and he is blocking your efforts it doesn't seem like he is as interested in being a helpful partner as he is in using your illness as an excuse for his own issues.  It is possible you are focused on him becoming the kind of partner to you that he is demonstrating he can't be.  If you do go back into counseling perhaps the focus should be on you, your health and what the best path forward is to improvement.  The answer you might come up with could be that you are better off without someone who isn't capable of being the partner you need.\",\n",

I got a nebulizer and chest vest, and take mucinex, to help relieve these secretions. Also have to actively pay attention to infections etc and treat immediately.

Along with this, I had severe light sensitivity so badly that I had to wear my sunglasses all day long, even indoors. I immediately made an eye appointment for two days later. The doctor ran some tests and told me my corneas were severely scratched. He prescribed me Prednisolone eye drops (to put in every hour) and Neomycin Ophthalmic Ointment (to put in at bedtime). Neither of these helped at all. I went back to him 10 days later, and he told me to continue the drops but stop the ointment. Still no change. Finally, after 3 visits to him in a month, he referred me to a retina specialist for December 18th to check for retina damage that he might not be able to see. \\n\\nThe specialist was in the room for about 4 minutes, told me there was nothing wrong with my retinas, laughed at the original ophthalmologist’s diagnosis of scratched corneas, and said I likely have diabetes or had a mini stroke. He suggested I get a physical. So that’s what I did on December 27th. \\n\\nThis physician ruled out a stroke immediately, thank goodness. He ordered bloodwork and wrote on my symptoms “joint pain”, which I didn’t originally complain to him about because I just figured that was from being slightly overweight and sedentary. He said that my insurance would cover the cost of the ANA test if he wrote that down, so I didn’t argue. I had 7 vials of blood taken. Since it was the weekend and New Years, I didn’t get an answer for another week. The doctor called and told me that my bloodwork came back positive for an autoimmune disorder suggestive of Sjögren’s. I had never heard of that, but upon reading about the symptoms, it started to make sense, as I have a dry mouth and nose also. He referred me to a rheumatologist, but that appointment isn’t until June (as I’ve read is typical for it to take up to 6 months to get in). \\n\\nI watched a lady’s video on YouTube (can’t remember her name) and she mentioned that changing to a keto lifestyle has improved her symptoms.

You're going to have to be seriously diligent about applying lotion. Its just one of the lesser known symptoms of Sjogrens.  I apply after every shower (and before bed in the winter/dry season) and I keep lotion in my purse for my hands after every hand wash.  \\n3. Talk to your doctor about pilocarpine.  My rheumatologist prescribed it to me for up to 4 times per day and I started with just once in the morning and eventually added one more at night. Its made a HUGE different for me.  I had the mucus issue that you have, but I also developed a dry cough that I couldn't kick and the pilocarpine fixed both.  I still keep the biotene spray in my purse for emergency issues, but I rarely need it now unless I have a really bad flare-up.  \\n\\nSo, I don't want to be a dick about this, but you really do need to prepare yourself for the reality of your situation regarding doctor's visits.  I see my rheumatologist 4 times per year, my optometrist twice per year (to check for retinal damage from the plaquenil), a neurologist once per year to watch for signs that my sjogren's caused neuropathy is worsening, and I get dental cleanings 3-4 times per year because low saliva production can cause increased plaque and gum decay.  On top of that, I found that even with treatment it became very difficult for me to keep up with all of the things that I was doing before, especially at work, because of the fatigue.  I don't know how I could have functioned without an army of doctors helping me with suggestions for my issues.  \\n\\nAt the very least I have to strongly urge you to find a better rheumatologist to help you get to the point where you're maintaining your sjogrens symptoms bearably.  You almost certainly need to be on medications (probably starting with plaquenil) and you need to have your vitamin levels checked as that many autoimmune patients don't process dietary vitamins (especially Vitamin D) as well.  Sjogrens can cause brain fog and fatigue, but Sjogrens + low Vitamin D was way, way worse for me.  If your doctor is not taking your concerns seriously its time to move on, no matter how many times it takes.  I know it doesn't feel that simple, especially if you're living in a rural area where there aren't many options, but spending money on a doctor who isn't helping you is not just demoralizing, its pointless.\",\n",
