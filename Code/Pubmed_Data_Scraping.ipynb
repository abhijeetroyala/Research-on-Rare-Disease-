Recently, Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome combined with localized nodular AL amyloidosis has been noted. Here, we report Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome cases showing multifocal nodular AL amyloidosis and the followed benign course. <b>Materials and methods:</b> We investigated the clinical pictures and histopathological findings of three cases with both presence of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome and localized nodular AL amyloidosis, paying a special attention to the distribution of amyloidoma. <b>Results:</b> All three cases were middle-aged females. In two of three cases localized deposits of AL amyloid preceded Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome. Amyloidoma was detected in scalp, eyelid, cheek, larynx, trachea, lung and breast, and around these amyloid-deposited lesions infiltration of plasma cells was seen. Pulmonary amyloidosis was consistently accompanied with parenchymal cystic lesions, but this amyloidosis did not produce any significant respiratory symptoms. Some of large pulmonary amyloidomas showed cavity formation and subsequent shrinkage. In two cases amyloid deposition was found on gastric mucosa. Two cases received small doses of oral prednisone, with no further appearance of amyloidoma. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome-related plasma cell disorder may be responsible for the formation of this unique multifocal nodular AL amyloidosis.\\'\"',\n",

Three HIV-infected patients (two children and one adult) and three middle aged female patients presented with parotid and submandibular cysts, two of which were bilateral along with submandibular (one each in the HIV and the autoimmune group).

Of the other three cases of Sjogren syndrome, two were primary and one, secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. All the cysts regressed completely with treatment of the respective diseases which was confirmed by ultrasonograms. Lymphoepithelial cysts are produced by release of serous secretion by the acinar and ductal cells within the epithelial islands in the process of their destruction. Possibly, antibody mediated increased secretion in the initial stages also plays a role. Lymphoepithelial cysts of HIV patients may occur in the course of treatment, not necessarily in the beginning, though it resolves spontaneously.

       " '\"\\'The Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the ALDH3A2 gene, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). FALDH prevents the accumulation of toxic fatty aldehydes by converting them into fatty acids. Pathogenic ALDH3A2 variants cause symptoms such as ichthyosis, spasticity, intellectual disability, and a wide range of less common clinical features. Interpreting patient-to-patient variability is often complicated by inconsistent reporting and negatively impacts on establishing robust criteria to measure the success of SLS treatments. Thus, with this study, patient-centered literature data was merged into a concise genotype-based, open-access database (www.LOVD.nl/ALDH3A2). One hundred and seventy eight individuals with 90 unique SLS-causing variants were included with phenotypic data being available for more than 90%. While the three lead symptoms did occur in almost all cases, more heterogeneity was observed for other frequent clinical manifestations of SLS. However, a stringent genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was hampered by the considerable variability in reporting phenotypic features.

       " '\"\\'<b>Purpose:</b> Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome is a rare, autosomal, recessive neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in the <i>ALDH3A2</i> gene, which encodes the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme. Deficiency in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase results in an abnormal accumulation of toxic fatty aldehydes in the brain and skin, which cause spasticity, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, and other clinical manifestations. We present the clinical features and mutation analyses of a case of SLS.<b>Materials and Methods:</b> The family history and clinical data of the patient were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patient and her parents, and next-generation sequencing was performed. The candidate mutation sites that required further validation were then sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatics software PSIPRED and RaptorX were used to predict the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins.<b>Results:</b> The patient, a five-year-old girl with complaints of cough for three days and intermittent convulsions for seven hours, was admitted to the hospital. Other clinical manifestations included spastic paraplegia, mental retardation, tooth defects, and ichthyosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed periventricular leukomalacia. Genetic screening revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene: a frameshift mutation c.779delA (p.K260Rfs*6) and a missense mutation c.1157A\\\\\\\\u2009>\\\\\\\\u2009G (p.N386S).

We identified five mutations in ALDH3A2 gene including a novel one and suggest a founder effect. Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of lipid metabolism caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene that codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase and result in a triad of ichthyosis, spasticity, and mental retardation. Clinical, radiological, biochemical, and neurophysiological evaluation in ten SLS patients descending from seven unrelated Egyptian pedigrees was followed by Sanger sequencing of ALDH3A2 performed by ABI 3500. All patients presented with SLS triad; ichthyosis, spasticity of four limbs and hyperreflexia with an intelligent quotient (IQ) ranging from (39 to 69). Other manifestations were dysmorphic features, seizures, and skeletal and ophthalmological affection. Mutational analysis of ALDH3A2 gene revealed three missense, one splice site, and one novel stop codon mutation; c.991G>T (p.E331X). Biochemical studies showed decrease of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. Our results reinforce the distinct clinical, radiological, and biochemical features of ALDH3A2-related SLS which are the clue for targeted molecular testing. Moreover, we present additional unreported clinical findings and a novel mutation thus expanding the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of this rare disorder.\\'\"',\n",

Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is one such disorder, which is caused by mutations in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3A2. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying SLS pathology has remained unknown. In this study, we found that Aldh3a2 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons in the mouse brain, and neurons of Aldh3a2 knockout (KO) mice exhibited impaired metabolism of the long-chain base, a component of sphingolipids. Aldh3a2 KO mice showed several abnormalities corresponding to SLS symptoms in behavioral tests, including increased paw slips on a balance beam and light-induced anxiety. In their brain tissue, 2-hydroxygalactosylceramide, an important lipid for myelin function and maintenance, was reduced by the inactivation of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. Our findings provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for neural pathogenesis caused by lipid metabolism abnormalities.-Kanetake, T., Sassa, T., Nojiri, K., Sawai, M., Hattori, S., Miyakawa, T., Kitamura, T., Kihara, A.

       " '\"\\'Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder featuring cerebellar ataxia, early-onset cataracts, chronic myopathy, variable intellectual disability and delayed motor development. More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression. \\'\"',\n",

Here, we used an adoptive transfer model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome to determine if female mice harbor a sex-specific defect in salivary-gland-protective regulatory T (Treg) cells. Transfer of cervical lymph node (LN) cells from female NOD mice into sex-matched NOD-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) recipients resulted in sialadenitis, regardless of the presence or absence of Treg cells. In contrast, transfer of cervical LN cells from male NOD mice into sex-matched NOD-SCID recipients only resulted in sialadenitis when Treg cells were depleted before transfer, suggesting that male NOD mice have functional salivary-gland-protective Treg cells. Notably, the host environment affected the ability of Treg cells to prevent sialadenitis with testosterone promoting salivary gland protection. Treg cells from male mice did not protect against sialadenitis in female recipients. Testosterone treatment of female recipients of bulk cervical LN cells decreased sialadenitis, and Treg cells from female mice were capable of protecting against development of sialadenitis in male recipients. Hence, our data demonstrate that female NOD mice develop sialadenitis through a defect in salivary-gland-protective Treg cells that can be reversed in the presence of testosterone.\\'\"',\n",

Both Ro epitopes were strongly recognized by almost all pS patients, independent from EGM, while these antibodies were absent in RA patients. Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome and RA patients have distinct serological profiles when analysing RF and Ro-specific antibodies. A longitudinal study of switched RF isotypes in pS patients is worthwhile from an immunological point of view, but its value is limited regarding identification of pS patients prone to developing EGM or RA patients prone to developing secondary sicca symptoms.\\'\"',\n",

It is an inborn error of lipid metabolism caused by biallelic mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene encoding the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase that plays a pivotal role in metabolism of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols. In this report, we describe the clinical, neuro-radiological and molecular findings of 35 patients with SLS. All patients shared the typical clinical manifestations of SLS including spasticity, ichthyosis and intellectual disability. Brain MRI demonstrated deep while matter affection in all patients that varied in severity. Mutational analysis of the ALDH3A2 gene revealed 16 distinct mutations including 11 previously unreported ones. Three mutations (p.S365L, p.R9* and p.G400R) were recurrent in our patients with frequencies ranging from 12 to 24%. Interestingly, patients carrying the two new mutations p.R9* and p.G400R shared similar haplotypes suggesting possible founder effects in our population. In conclusion, we present a large cohort of patients from the same ethnicity with the characteristic clinical and brain imaging findings of SLS but with variable inter and intra familial severity and expressivity.

LPR was diagnosed with positive scores on the Reflux Symptom Index and Reflux and Reflux Finding Score, corroborated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or 24-hour pH-metry. Salivary EGF concentrations of both unstimulated and mechanically stimulated saliva were established using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the significance level was set at 95%. Twenty-one patients and 19 controls were studied. All patients had LPR and 60% also had GERD. The mean salivary EGF concentration of unstimulated and stimulated saliva in the control group was 1,751.37 pg/ml and 544.76 pg/ml, respectively. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary EGF concentrations in the study group were 2,534.65 pg/ml and 920.69 pg/ml, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant.

The pulmonary manifestations of primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome may be categorized as airway abnormalities, interstitial pneumonias, and lymphoproliferative disorders; in each category, bronchiectasis or centrilobular nodules, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia are common. These manifestations do not usually occur in isolation; they are concomitantly seen with other types of lesions. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and amyloidosis are key components of lymphoproliferative disorders, and MALT lymphoma should always be considered because its morphologic characteristics are similar to those of benign lymphoproliferative disorders. Amyloidosis is rare but important because it carries a risk for underlying MALT lymphoma or plasmacytoma, and it may lead to hemoptysis during biopsy.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autoimmune disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, 80 missense mutations have been identified in association with the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 3 Family Member A2 (ALDH3A2) gene causing SLS. Disruption of the function of ALDH3A2 leads to excessive accumulation of fat in the cells, which interferes with the normal function of protective membranes or materials that are necessary for the body to function normally. We retrieved 54 missense mutations in the ALDH3A2 from the OMIM, UniProt, dbSNP, and HGMD databases that are known to cause SLS. These mutations were examined with various in silico stability tools, which predicted that the mutations p.S308N and p.R423H that are located at the protein-protein interaction domains are the most destabilizing. Furthermore, to determine the atomistic-level differences within the protein-protein interactions owing to mutations, we performed macromolecular simulation (MMS) using GROMACS to validate the motion patterns and dynamic behavior of the biological system. We found that both mutations (p.S380N and p.R423H) had significant effects on the protein-protein interaction and disrupted the dimeric interactions. The computational pipeline provided in this study helps to elucidate the potential structural and functional differences between the ALDH3A2 native and mutant homodimeric proteins, and will pave the way for drug discovery against specific targets in the SLS patients.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sjogren Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of lipid metabolism due to mutations in the <i>ALDH3A2</i> that result in a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH).

The classical triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity characterizes clinical features. Preterm birth is common. \\\\\"Glistening white dots\\\\\" in the retina is a pathognomic clinical feature. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrates leukoencephalopathy predominant in the periventricular region. Cerebral MR spectroscopy reveals a characteristic abnormal lipid peak at 1.3ppm and a small peak at 0.9ppm. The primary role of FALDH is oxidation of medium and long-chain aliphatic aldehydes derived from fatty alcohol, phytanic acid, ether glycerolipids and sphingolipids. The diagnosis is based on the typical phenotype, demonstration of the enzyme deficiency and presence of biallelic mutations in the <i>ALDH3A2</i>. The management of SLS largely remains symptomatic currently.

Invariant natural killer (NK) T cells (iNKT) are a T-cell subset able to recognize glycolipid antigens. Their function remains unclear, but studies have pointed out their ability to modulate the immune system through the promotion of specific cytokine milieu. In this review, we discussed the possible role of iNKT in pSS development, as well as their implications as future markers of disease activity.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells are required to maintain immunological tolerance; however, defects in specific organ-protective Treg cell functions have not been demonstrated in organ-specific autoimmunity. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop lacrimal and salivary gland autoimmunity and are a well-characterized model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome. Lacrimal gland disease in NOD mice is male-specific, but the role of Treg cells in this sex-specificity is not known. This study aimed to determine if male-specific autoimmune dacryoadenitis in the NOD mouse model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome is the result of lacrimal gland-protective Treg cell dysfunction. An adoptive transfer model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome was developed by transferring cells from the lacrimal gland-draining cervical lymph nodes of NOD mice to lymphocyte-deficient NOD-SCID mice. Transfer of bulk cervical lymph node cells modelled the male-specific dacryoadenitis that spontaneously develops in NOD mice. Female to female transfers resulted in dacryoadenitis if the CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg-enriched population was depleted before transfer; however, male to male transfers resulted in comparable dacryoadenitis regardless of the presence or absence of Treg cells within the donor cell population. Hormone manipulation studies suggested that this Treg cell dysfunction was mediated at least in part by androgens. Surprisingly, male Treg cells were capable of preventing the transfer of dacryoadenitis to female recipients. These data suggest that male-specific factors promote reversible dysfunction of lacrimal gland-protective Treg cells and, to our knowledge, form the first evidence for reversible organ-protective Treg cell dysfunction in organ-specific autoimmunity.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'<b>Purpose</b>: Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive crystalline maculopathy, congenital ichthyosis, spasticity and intellectual disability. We review the genetic, biochemical and clinical aspects of SLS with a particular focus on the ophthalmologic features of the disease.<b>Methods</b>: Published reports of SLS are combined with clinical experience to provide an overview of this disease.<b>Results</b>: SLS is caused by bi-allelic mutations in ALDH3A2, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, a key enzyme needed for the metabolism of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols. SLS patients display perifoveal crystalline inclusions (glistening white dots) that appear in early childhood, vary from sparse to florid and are located in the inner retina. Other findings include retinal thinning, cystic macular degeneration, retinal pigment epithelium atrophy and deficiency of macular pigment. Photophobia is common. Visual evoked potentials are often absent or delayed, whereas electroretinography studies are usually normal. Mild-moderate deficits in visual acuity are common but vision is usually preserved into adulthood. The maculopathy is thought to be due to the accumulation of fatty aldehydes and/or alcohols, which alter membrane function. Defective macular pigment metabolism may also contribute to a unique susceptibility to photo-oxidative damage in the retina.<b>Conclusions</b>: The distinctive retinal phenotype, together with the neurologic and cutaneous symptoms, allows the ophthalmologist to reliably diagnose SLS. Although no effective treatment exists for the ocular symptoms, emerging insight into the pathogenic mechanisms at play in the eye promises to bring effective therapy for SLS in the future.\\'\"',\n",

The authors describe 2 unrelated Honduran patients who carried the same novel homozygous nonsense mutation (c.1309A>T, p.K437X) and ALDH3A2 DNA haplotype, but widely differed in disease severity. One patient exhibited spastic quadriplegia with unusual neuroregression, whereas the other patient had the usual static form of spastic diplegia with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Biochemical analyses showed a similar profound deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and impaired fatty alcohol metabolism in both patients\\' cultured fibroblasts. These results indicate that variation in the neurologic phenotype of Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome is not strictly determined by the ALDH3A2 mutation or the biochemical defect as expressed in cultured fibroblasts, but by unidentified epigenetic/environmental factors, gene modifiers, or other mechanisms. \\\\\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that may affect 1 in 1000 people (overwhelmingly women) and that can be a serious disease with excess mortality due to severe organ-specific involvements and the development of B cell lymphoma; systemic involvement clearly marks the disease prognosis, and strongly suggests the need for closer follow-up and more robust therapeutic management. Therapy is established according to the organ involved and severity. As a rule, the management of systemic SjS should be organ-specific, with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents limited to potentially-severe involvements; unfortunately, the limited evidence available for these drugs, together with the potential development of serious adverse events, makes solid therapeutic recommendations difficult. The emergence of biological therapies has increased the therapeutic armamentarium available to treat primary SjS. Biologics currently used in SjS patients are used off-label and are overwhelmingly agents targeting B cells, but the most recent studies are moving on into the evaluation of targeting specific cytokines involved in the SjS pathogenesis. The most recent etiopathogenic advances in SjS are shedding some light in the search for new highly-selective biological therapies without the adverse effects of the standard drugs currently used (corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs).

MSS-patients typically present with congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, cerebellar ataxia and progressive vacuolar myopathy. However, atypical clinical presentations associated with <i>SIL1</i> mutations have been described over the last years; compound heterozygosity of SIL1 missense mutations even resulted in a phenotype not fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria of MSS. Thus, a read-out system to evaluate reliably the pathogenicity of amino acid changes in <i>SIL1</i> is needed. Here, we aim to provide suitable cellular biomarkers enabling the robust evaluation of pathogenicity of SIL1 mutations. <b>Methods:</b> Five <i>SIL1</i> variants including one polymorphism (p.K132Q), three known pathogenic mutations (p.V231_I232del, p.G312R, and p.L457P) and one ambiguous missense variant (p.R92W) were studied along with the wild-type proteins in Hek293 <i>in vitro</i> models by cell biological assays, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence as well as electron microscopy. Moreover, the SIL1-interactomes were interrogated by tandem-affinity-purification and subsequent mass spectrometry. <b>Results:</b> Our combined studies confirmed the pathogenicity of p.V231_I232del, p.G312R, and p.L457P by showing instability of the proteins as well as tendency to form aggregates. This observation is in line with altered structure of the ER-Golgi system and vacuole formation upon expression of these pathogenic SIL1-mutants as well as the presence of oxidative or ER-stress. Reduced cellular fitness along with abnormal mitochondrial architecture could also be observed. Notably, both the polymorphic p.K132Q and the ambiguous p.R92W variants did not elicit such alterations. Study of the SIL1-interactome identified POC1A as a novel binding partner of wild-type SIL1; the interaction is disrupted upon the presence of pathogenic mutants but not influenced by the presence of benign variants. Disrupted SIL1-POC1A interaction is associated with centrosome disintegration. <b>Conclusions:</b> We developed a combination of cellular outcome measures to evaluate the pathogenicity of <i>SIL1</i> variants in suitable <i>in vitro</i> models and demonstrated that the p.

This prospective case-control study compared stable SS-DED patients with non-SS-DED control from several aspects, including clinical indices for TF homeostasis, 2 DED diagnostic biomarkers (MMP-9 and lactoferrin), and the proteome of flush tears. Compared with non-SS-DED controls, stably controlled SS-DED subjects had less tear secretion and higher ocular surface inflammation, a higher concentration ratio of tear MMP-9/lactoferrin, a more diverse tear proteome, and lower spectral intensities of lipocalin-1, lacritin, and prolactin-inducible protein among the abundant tear proteins. For stable SS-DED patients, the concentration ratio of tear MMP-9/lactoferrin and the corrected lipocalin-1 signal was positively correlated with ocular inflammation and TF stability, respectively. MMP-9 released from stressed ocular surface epithelium and lipocalin-1 secreted from the energetic lacrimal gland are two tear biomarkers responding well to TF homeostasis.

       " '\"\\'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia among patients scheduled for open heart surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. According to international guidelines, symptomatic and selected asymptomatic patients should be offered concomitant surgical AF ablation in conjunction with valvular or coronary surgery. The gold standard in AF surgery is the Cox Maze III (\\\\\"cut-and-sew\\\\\") procedure, with surgical incisions in both atria according to a specified pattern, in order to prevent AF reentry circuits from developing. Over 90% of patients treated with the Cox Maze III procedure are free of AF after 1 year. Recent developments in ablation technology have introduced several energy sources capable of creating nonconducting atrial wall lesions. In addition, simplified lesion patterns have been suggested, but results with these techniques have been unsatisfactory. There is a clear need for standardization in AF surgery. The Swedish Arrhythmia Surgery Group, represented by surgeons from all Swedish units for cardiothoracic surgery, has therefore reached a consensus on surgical treatment of concomitant AF. This consensus emphasizes adherence to the lesion pattern in the Cox Maze III procedure and the use of biatrial lesions in nonparoxysmal AF.\\'\"',\n",

In both humans and NOD mice, the early immune response that drives T-cell infiltration into lacrimal and salivary glands is poorly understood. In NOD mice, lacrimal gland autoimmunity spontaneously occurs only in males with testosterone playing a role in promoting lacrimal gland inflammation, while female lacrimal glands are protected by regulatory T cells (Tregs). The mechanisms of this male-specific lacrimal gland autoimmunity are not known. Here, we studied the effects of Treg depletion in hormone-manipulated NOD mice and lacrimal gland gene expression to determine early signals required for lacrimal gland inflammation. While Treg-depletion was not sufficient to drive dacryoadenitis in castrated male NOD mice, chemokines (<i>Cxcl9</i>, <i>Ccl19</i>) and other potentially disease-relevant genes (<i>Epsti1</i>, <i>Ubd</i>) were upregulated in male lacrimal glands. Expression of <i>Cxcl9</i> and <i>Ccl19</i>, in particular, remained significantly upregulated in the lacrimal glands of lymphocyte-deficient NOD-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice and their expression was modulated by type I interferon signaling. Notably, <i>Ifnar1</i>-deficient NOD mice did not develop dacryoadenitis.

The results showed that saliva production was decreased and anti-sjogren syndrome B (anti-SSB) level was increased in SS. PCR, western blot and immunohischemistry experiments indicated that the HMGB1 and aquaporin 5 (AQP5) levels were enhanced and diminished in SS than those in Control, respectively. While the mice were treated with anti-HMGB1, xerostomia was reversed due to the elevated saliva production and reduced anti-SSB level. In addition, it was found that the inhibition of HMGB1 restrained the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\\\\u03baB) axis activation. The TLR4 and p-I\\\\u03baB levels were alleviated, whilst the I\\\\u03baB\\\\u03b1 and NF-\\\\u03baB p65 levels were augmented. NF-\\\\u03baB p65 the binding activity was attenuated via electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) after anti-HMGB1 treatment. Moreover, the repression of HMGB1 facilitated the expression of AQP5.

Alongside widespread neuronal pathology, both HD patients and the R6/2 mouse model of HD exhibit weight loss and increased energy expenditure, providing a rationale for targeting whole-body energy metabolism in HD. Leptin-deficient mice display low energy expenditure and increased body weight. We therefore hypothesized that normalizing energy metabolism in R6/2 mice, utilizing leptin- deficiency, would lead to a slower disease progression in the R6/2 mouse. In this study, we show that R6/2 mice on a leptin-deficient genetic background display increased body weight and increased fat mass compared to R6/2 mice, as well as wild type littermates. The increased body weight was accompanied by low energy expenditure, illustrated by a reduction in respiratory exchange rate. Leptin-deficient R6/2 mice had large white adipocytes with white adipocyte gene expression characteristics, in contrast to white adipose tissue in R6/2 mice, where white adipose tissue showed signs of browning. Leptin-deficient R6/2 mice did not exhibit improved neuropathological measures. Our results indicate that lowering energy metabolism in HD, by increasing fat mass and reducing respiratory exchange rate, is not sufficient to affect neuropathology.

In addition, a literature search and miRNA target gene prediction were performed to collect miRNAs involved in SS pathogenesis. Subsequent to integrating all database results, miR-181a and -16 were identified to be associated with the Ro/SS-associated antigen A and La/SS-associated antigen B during SS pathogenesis. Therefore, these miRNAs were selected for further verification in labial salivary gland tissues of 28 patients with SS and 18 non-SS sicca syndrome control individuals by quantitative reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with the control group, 76 miRNAs were upregulated and 51 were downregulated in the labial salivary gland of SS patients according to microarray results. In particular, miR-181a and -16 expression levels in the labial salivary gland of SS patients were decreased in comparison with those in the controls. Furthermore, the decreased expression levels of these miRNAs were associated with the labial salivary pathological focus scores. In conclusion, the present study examined the miRNA profiles in the labial salivary glands of SS patients and detected decreased miR-181a and -16 expression levels compared with the control individuals. Finally, the decreased levels of miR-181a and -16 were associated with the salivary gland pathological focus scores, suggesting that miR-181a and -16 may serve a role in the pathogenesis of SS.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Drug attrition related to kidney toxicity remains a challenge in drug discovery and development. In vitro models established over the past 2 decades to supplement in vivo studies have improved the throughput capacity of toxicity evaluation, but usually suffer from low predictive value. To achieve a paradigm shift in the prediction of drug-induced kidney toxicity, two aspects are fundamental: increased physiological relevance of the kidney model, and use of appropriate toxicity end points. Recent studies have suggested that increasing the physiological relevance of kidney models can improve their sensitivity to drug-induced damage. Here, we discuss how advanced culture models, including modified cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cells, kidney organoid cultures, and microfluidic devices enhance in vivo similarity. To this end, culture models aim to increase the proximal tubule epithelial phenotype, reconstitute multiple tissue compartments and extracellular matrix, allow exposure to fluid shear stress, and enable interaction between multiple cell types. Applying computation-aided end points and novel biomarkers to advanced culture models will further improve sensitivity and clinical relevance of in vitro drug-induced toxicity prediction. Implemented at the right stage of drug discovery and development and coupled to high-content evaluation techniques, these models have the potential to reduce attrition and aid the selection of candidate drugs with an appropriate safety profile.\\'\"',\n",

At the stratum granulosum-stratum corneum interface, non-lamellar material displaced or replaced secreted lamellar membranes, and in the stratum corneum, the number of lamellar bilayers declined and lamellar membrane organization was disrupted by foci of lamellar/non-lamellar phase separation.

Inflammation and immune disorders including autoimmunity are considered as a consequence of the abnormal vascular regulation processes. On the other hand, decreased thirst feeling typical for FS-affected individuals may lead to extensive body dehydration resulting in dry eye appearance and breast cancer (BC) risk, amongst others.

The clinical symptoms of LCV associated with SS comprise palpable or nonpalpable purpura and urticarial vasculitis. Here, we report a case of LCV presenting as erythema gyratum repens (EGR)-like purpura in a 62-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and SS. EGR-like skin lesions, characterized by annular lesions with expanding concentric pattern and coalescing to form a zebra-like pattern or grain of wood pattern, can appear in various autoimmune conditions; however, EGR-like eruption in SS is extremely rare. On the basis of the expansion pattern, we considered that the EGR-like purpura in this case was elicited by urticarial vasculitis accompanied by SS.\\'\"',\n",

The purpose of the present study was to determine if treatment with pasteurized <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (p<i>Akk)</i> could prevent ovx-induced bone loss. Mice were treated with vehicle or p<i>Akk</i> for 4 wk, starting 3 days before ovx or sham surgery. Treatment with p<i>Akk</i> reduced fat mass accumulation confirming earlier findings. However, treatment with p<i>Akk</i> decreased trabecular and cortical bone mass in femur and vertebra of gonadal intact mice and did not protect from ovx-induced bone loss. Treatment with p<i>Akk</i> increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and increased expression of the calcium transporter <i>Trpv5</i> in kidney suggesting increased reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys. Serum amyloid A 3 (SAA3) can suppress bone formation and mediate the effects of PTH on bone resorption and bone loss in mice and treatment with p<i>Akk</i> increased serum levels of SAA3 and gene expression of <i>Saa3</i> in colon. Moreover, regulatory T cells can be protective of bone and p<i>Akk</i>-treated mice had decreased number of regulatory T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow. In conclusion, treatment with p<i>Akk</i> protected from ovx-induced fat mass gain but not from bone loss and reduced bone mass in gonadal intact mice. Our findings with p<i>Akk</i> differ from some probiotics that have been shown to protect bone mass, demonstrating that not all prebiotic and probiotic factors have the same effect on bone.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'SIL1 is a ubiquitous protein of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) acting as a co-chaperone for the ER-resident chaperone, BiP. Recessive mutations of the corresponding gene lead to vulnerability of skeletal muscle and central nervous system in man (Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome; MSS) and mouse. However, it is still unclear how loss of ubiquitous SIL1 leads to selective vulnerability of the nervous system and skeletal muscle whereas other cells and organs are protected from clinical manifestations. In this study we aimed to disentangle proteins participating in selective vulnerability of SIL1-deficient cells and tissues: morphological examination of MSS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells revealed altered organelle structures (ER, nucleus and mitochondria) thus showing subclinical vulnerability. To correlate structural perturbations with biochemical changes and to identify proteins potentially preventing phenotypical manifestation, proteomic studies have been carried out. Results of proteomic profiling are in line with the morphological findings and show affection of nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins as well as of such responsible for cellular viability. Moreover, expression patterns of proteins known to be involved in neuromuscular disorders or in development and function of the nervous system were altered. Paradigmatic findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry of splenic lymphocytes and the cerebellum of SIL1-deficient mice. Ataxin-10, identified with increased abundance in our proteome profile, is necessary for the neuronal survival but also controls muscle fiber apoptosis, thus declaring this protein as a plausible candidate for selective tissue vulnerability. Our combined results provide first insights into the molecular causes of selective cell and tissue vulnerability defining the MSS phenotype.\\'\"',\n",

We increased the correlation of patients with SS and NHL, with an adjusted HR of 4.314 (95% CI 2.784 - 6.685). Of the 16,396 SS patients, 66 individuals had salivary gland slices without NHL development, while the other 16,330 individuals that did not have salivary gland slices revealed 30 individuals that developed NHL. Of the 16,396 SS patients, 128 individuals underwent immunomodulator agent therapy (including hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and rituximab) without NHL development. None of the 30 individuals that developed NHL from SS received immunomodulator agents. We found that patients with SS were at an increased risk of developing NHL, with the most common NHL subgroup being diffused large B-cell lymphoma. SS patients who were candidates for salivary gland slices or immunomodulator agents were associated with a lower risk of developing lymphoma over time. We recommend that patients at a higher risk upon diagnosis of SS receive close follow-up and aggressive treatment.\\\\\"\"',\n",

It is typically discovered late during drug development, which reflects a lack of in vitro nephrotoxicity assays available that can be employed readily in early drug discovery, to identify and hence steer away from the risk. Here, we report the development of a high content screening assay in ciPTEC-OAT1, a proximal tubular cell line that expresses several relevant renal transporters, using five fluorescent dyes to quantify cell health parameters. We used a validation set of 62 drugs, tested across a relevant concentration range compared to their exposure in humans, to develop a model that integrates multi-parametric data and drug exposure information, which identified most proximal tubular toxic drugs tested (sensitivity 75%) without any false positives (specificity 100%). Due to the relatively high throughput (straight-forward assay protocol, 96-well format, cost-effective) the assay is compatible with the needs in the early drug discovery setting to enable identification, quantification and subsequent mitigation of the risk for nephrotoxicity.\\'\"',\n",

To date, the molecular mechanism underlying the symptoms characterizing SLS has been poorly understood. Using Aldh3a2(-/-) mice, we found here that Aldh3a2 was the major FALDH active in undifferentiated keratinocytes. Long-chain base metabolism was greatly impaired in Aldh3a2(-/-) keratinocytes. Phenotypically, the intercellular spaces were widened in the basal layer of the Aldh3a2(-/-) epidermis due to hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced genes were up-regulated in Aldh3a2(-/-) keratinocytes. Upon keratinocyte differentiation, the activity of another FALDH, Aldh3b2, surpassed that of Aldh3a2 As a result, Aldh3a2(-/-) mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in terms of their whole epidermis FALDH activity, and their skin barrier function was uncompromised under normal conditions. However, perturbation of the stratum corneum caused increased transepidermal water loss and delayed barrier recovery in Aldh3a2(-/-) mice. In conclusion, Aldh3a2(-/-) mice replicated some aspects of SLS symptoms, especially at the basal layer of the epidermis. Our results suggest that hyperproliferation of keratinocytes via oxidative stress responses may partly contribute to the ichthyosis symptoms of SLS. \\'\"',\n",

Here we report five individuals from four families presenting with variable clinical features including muscular dystrophy with a reduction in dystroglycan glycosylation, short stature, intellectual disability, and cataracts, overlapping both the dystroglycanopathies and Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing revealed homozygous missense and compound heterozygous mutations in INPP5K in the affected members of each family. INPP5K encodes the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase K, also known as SKIP (skeletal muscle and kidney enriched inositol phosphatase), which is highly expressed in the brain and muscle. INPP5K localizes to both the endoplasmic reticulum and to actin ruffles in the cytoplasm. It has been shown to regulate myoblast differentiation and has also been implicated in protein processing through its interaction with the ER chaperone HSPA5/BiP. We show that morpholino-mediated inpp5k loss of function in the zebrafish results in shortened body axis, microphthalmia with disorganized lens, microcephaly, reduced touch-evoked motility, and highly disorganized myofibers. Altogether these data demonstrate that mutations in INPP5K cause a congenital muscular dystrophy syndrome with short stature, cataracts, and intellectual disability.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have emerged in the past two decades as novel drug targets in many areas of research. Their importance in regulating signaling via G protein-coupled receptors has become evident as numerous studies have been published on the structure and function of RGS proteins. A number of genetic models have also been developed, demonstrating the potential clinical importance of RGS proteins in various disease states, including central nervous system disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and several types of cancer. Apart from their classical mechanism of action as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), RGS proteins can also serve other noncanonical functions. This opens up a new approach to targeting RGS proteins in drug discovery as the view on the function of these proteins is constantly evolving. This chapter summarizes the latest development in RGS protein drug discovery with special emphasis on noncanonical functions and regulatory mechanisms of RGS protein expression. As more reports are being published on this group of proteins, it is becoming clear that modulation of GAP activity might not be the only way to therapeutically target RGS proteins.\\'\"',\n",

Short-term colonization of germ-free mice with GM results in an activation of CD4+T cells, resulting in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone and thereby activation of osteoclastic bone resorption. Besides these immune-mediated effects on bone mass, the GM is involved in nutritional uptake and may, thereby, regulate overall body growth and bone sizes possibly mediated via altered IGF-I levels. We recently introduced a new term \\\\\"osteomicrobiology\\\\\" for the rapidly emerging research field of the role of the microbiota in bone health. This research field is aimed to bridge the gaps between bone physiology, gastroenterology, immunology, and microbiology. Future studies will determine if the GM is a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis and if the GM composition might be used as a biomarker for fracture prediction.\\'\"',\n",

The mRNA levels of SIL1 were decreased by 56.6% and 37.5% in immortalized lymphoblasts of the patients respectively; the protein levels of SIL1 were substantially decreased.

We studied three Turkish Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome patients with ichthyosis, developmental delay, spastic diplegia, and brain white matter disease. One patient was homozygous for a novel ALDH3A2 mutation in exon 5. The mutation involves the codon 228 (CGC) with the transversion G->A modifying the codon in CAC, leading to the substitution of the original arginine with a histidine (R228H), modifying the stereospecific properties of this region.

Two of the previously described mutations had already been identified in the same region of Europe, suggesting a putative founder effect. We suggest that, (1) when clinical and MR features are present, direct sequencing of the ALDH3A2 gene in SLS is of particular interest without necessity of a skin biopsy for enzymatic assay in order to propose genetic counsel and (2) identification of mutations already described in the same population with putative founder effects may simplify genetic analysis in this context.\\'\"',\n",

Ghrelin, a gut peptide-hormone, plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism, stimulating appetite, and affects brain function and increases neuronal survival. The R6/2 mouse model of HD has previously been shown to exhibit progressive weight loss, dysregulated glucose metabolism, skeletal muscle atrophy and altered body composition. In this study, we targeted energy metabolism in R6/2 mice using ghrelin administration, with the primary aim to delay weight loss and reduce muscle atrophy.

To investigate whether this is a direct effect of sex-steroids (SS) in white adipose tissue (WAT), we developed a male mouse model overexpressing the aromatase enzyme, converting testosterone (T) to estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>), specifically in WAT (Ap2-arom mice). Adipose tissue E<sub>2</sub> levels were increased while circulating SS levels were unaffected in male Ap2-arom mice. Importantly, male Ap2-arom mice were more insulin sensitive compared with WT mice and exhibited increased serum adiponectin levels and upregulated expression of <i>Glut4</i> and <i>Irs1</i> in WAT. The expression of markers of macrophages and immune cell infiltration was markedly decreased in WAT of male Ap2-arom mice. The adipogenesis was enhanced in male Ap2-arom mice, supported by elevated <i>Pparg</i> expression in WAT and enhanced differentiation of preadipocyte into mature adipocytes. In summary, increased adipose tissue aromatase activity reduces adipose tissue inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity in male mice. We propose that estrogen increases insulin sensitivity via a local effect in WAT on adiponectin expression, adipose tissue inflammation, and adipogenesis.\\'\"',\n",

Germinal center (GC) development was promoted in this SS model along with an increase of Tfh cells and GC B cells. The severity of the autoimmune lesions was correlated with the number of Tfh cells detected in the spleen of the SS model mice. In addition, treatment with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody effectively suppressed the autoimmune lesions with a reduction of Tfh cells and GC B cells. Comprehensive gene analysis revealed that several genes associated with Tfh cell differentiation, including achaete-scute homologue 2 (Ascl2), were up-regulated in peripheral CD25<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in SS model mice compared with those in control mice. Moreover, an experiment using CD4<sup>Cre</sup>Bcl6<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice that received neonatal thymectomy treatment demonstrated that Ascl2 contributes to the Tfh cell differentiation associated with autoimmunity during the early stages, independent of Bcl6.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by targeted destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands resulting in symptoms of severe ocular and oral dryness. Despite its prevalence, the mechanisms driving autoimmune manifestations are unclear. In patients and in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome, lymphocytic infiltrates consist of CD4 and CD8 T cells, although the role of CD8 T cells in disease pathogenesis has been largely unexplored. Here, we evaluated the contribution of CD8 T cells to lacrimal and salivary gland autoimmunity. Within the lacrimal and salivary glands of NOD mice, CD8 T cells were proliferating, expressed an activated phenotype, and produced inflammatory cytokines. Transfer of purified CD8 T cells isolated from the cervical lymph nodes (LNs) of NOD mice into NOD-severe combined immunodeficiency recipients resulted in inflammation of the lacrimal glands, but was not sufficient to cause inflammation of the salivary glands. Lacrimal gland-infiltrating CD8 T cells displayed a cytotoxic phenotype, and epithelial cell damage in the lacrimal glands was observed in recipients of CD8 T cells regardless of the presence of CD4 T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CD8 T cells have a pathogenic role in lacrimal gland autoimmunity. The gland-specific pathogenicity of CD8 T cells makes them a valuable resource to further understand the mechanisms that discriminate lacrimal versus salivary gland autoimmunity and for the development of new therapeutics that target the early stages of disease.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are characterized by chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, which cause joint tissue damage and destruction by triggering reduced mobility and debilitation in patients with these diseases. Initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory stages account for several mechanisms that involve immune cells as key players and the interaction of the immune cells with other tissues. Indeed, the overlapping of certain clinical and serologic manifestations between SS and RA may indicate that numerous immunologic-related mechanisms are involved in the physiopathology of both these diseases. It is widely accepted that epigenetic pathways play an essential role in the development and function of the immune system. Although many published studies have attempted to elucidate the relation between epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, miRNAs) and autoimmune disorders, the contribution of epigenetic regulation to the pathogenesis of SS and RA is at present poorly understood. This review attempts to shed light from a critical point of view on the identification of the most relevant epigenetic mechanisms related to RA and SS by explaining intricate regulatory processes and phenotypic features of both autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we point out some epigenetic markers which can be used to monitor the inflammation status and the dysregulated immunity in SS and RA. Finally, we discuss the inconvenience of using epigenetic data obtained from bulk immune cell populations instead specific immune cell subpopulations.\\'\"',\n",

Previous studies have shown that compensatory eye-saccades improve visual acuity and that the timing of the saccade is important. Most of the tests involved in testing VOR are made with passive head movement, that do not necessarily reflect the activities of daily living and thus not being proportionate to symptoms and distresses of the patients. <b>Objective:</b> To examine differences between active (self-generated) or passive (imposed by the examiner) head rotations while trying to maintain visual focus on a target. <b>Method:</b> Nine subjects with unilateral total vestibular loss were recruited (4 men and 5 women, mean age 47) and tested with video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and Head Impulse Testing Device-Functional Test (HITD-FT) during passive and active movements while looking at a target. VOR gain, latencies of covert saccades, frequency of covert saccades and visual acuity were measured and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Active head-impulses toward the lesioned side resulted in better visual acuity (<i>p</i> = 0.002) compared to conventional passive head-impulses and generated eye-saccades with significantly shorter latencies (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Active movements to the lesioned side generated dynamic visual acuities that were as good as when testing the intact side. <b>Conclusion:</b> Actively generated head impulses resulted in normal dynamic visual acuity, even when performed toward the side of total vestibular loss. This might be attributed to the appearance of short-latency covert saccades. The results show a strong relationship between self-generated movements, latencies of covert saccades and outcome in HITD-FT, i.e., a better dynamic visual function with less retinal slip which is the main function of the VOR. The method of active HITD-FT might be valuable in assessing vestibular compensation and monitoring ongoing vestibular rehabilitation.\\'\"',\n",

Cox proportional hazard ratios were calculated during a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, during which 178 deaths occurred. Short telomeres at baseline was strongly associated with mortality risks, with a 40 to 70% increased risk of all-cause mortality, and a 2-fold increased risk of cancer mortality. Longitudinal changes in TL revealed shortening in 83% of individuals, whilst 10% extended their telomeres. TL attrition did not predict all-cause or cancer mortality, but we found a 60% decreased risk for cardiovascular mortality in those who shortened their telomeres. Our data show an increased risk of mortality in individuals with short baseline telomeres, but no relations to all-cause, and cancer mortality for changes in TL.

       " '\"\\'ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) binds directly to small regulatory RNA and is a key effector protein of post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> The formation of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) of AGO1 and small RNA requires the function of the heat shock protein 70/90 chaperone system. Some functions of AGO1 occur in association with endomembranes, in particular the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), but proteins interacting with AGO1 in membrane fractions remain unidentified. In this study, we show that the farnesylated heat shock protein 40 homologs, J2 and J3, associate with AGO1 in membrane fractions in a manner that involves protein farnesylation. We also show that three changes in AGO1 function are detectable in mutants in protein farnesylation and J2/J3. First, perturbations of the HSP40/70/90 pathway by mutation of <i>J3</i>, <i>HSP90</i>, and farnesyl transferase affect the amounts of AGO1 associated with membranes. Second, miRNA association with membrane-bound polysomes is increased in farnesyl transferase and farnesylation-deficient J2/J3 mutants. Third, silencing by noncell autonomously acting short interfering RNAs is impaired. These observations highlight the involvement of farnesylated J2/J3 in small RNA-mediated gene regulation, and suggest that the importance of chaperone-AGO1 interaction is not limited to the RISC assembly process.\\'\"',\n",

Setting Tertiary care pediatric hospital. Subjects and Methods Caregivers of patients aged <18 years were surveyed to assess factors in decision making related to common otolaryngologic surgical procedures, including outpatient tympanostomy tubes and adenotonsillectomy, between July 2015 and June 2016. Children in foster care and those who underwent nonelective surgery were excluded. Decision-making factors were statistically analyzed with univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression. Results A total of 155 caregivers completed the survey. The median age of the patient at the time of the surgery was 3 years. Surgical procedures included tympanostomy tube placement (51%), adenotonsillectomy (37%), tympanostomy tube placement with adenotonsillectomy (10%), and other (2%). The mean \\\\u00b1 SD annual deductible per child was $1870 \\\\u00b1 $140, and the mean maximum out-of-pocket expense was $3833 \\\\u00b1 $235.

In this study, next generation sequencing was used to study the extent of ac-Nglycs among clonally expanded cells from all IGVH families in the salivary glands of pSS patients. RNA was isolated from parotid gland biopsies of five pSS patients and five non-pSS sicca controls. IGHV sequences covering all functional IGHV genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. Each biopsy recovered 1,800-4,000 unique IGHV sequences. No difference in IGHV gene usage was observed between pSS and non-pSS sequences. Clonally related sequences with more than 0.3% of the total number of sequences per patient were referred to as dominant clone. Overall, 70 dominant clones were found in pSS biopsies, compared to 15 in non-pSS. No difference in percentage mutation in dominant clone-derived IGHV sequences was seen between pSS and non-pSS. In pSS, no evidence for antigen-driven selection in dominant clones was found. We observed a significantly higher amount of ac-Nglycs among pSS dominant clone-derived sequences compared to non-pSS. Ac-Nglycs were, however, not restricted to dominant clones or IGHV gene. Most ac-Nglycs were detected in the framework 3 region. No stereotypic rheumatoid factor rearrangements were found in dominant clones. Lineage tree analysis showed in four pSS patients, but not in non-pSS, the presence of the germline sequence from a dominant clone. Presence of germline sequence and mutated IGHV sequences in the same dominant clone provide evidence that this clone originated from a na\\\\u00efve B-cell recruited into the parotid gland to expand and differentiate locally into plasma cells. The increased presence of ac-Nglycs in IGHV sequences, due to somatic hypermutation, might provide B-cells an escape mechanism to survive during immune response. We speculate that glycosylation of the B-cell receptor makes the cell sensitive to environmental lectin signals to contribute to aberrant B-cell selection in pSS parotid glands.\\\\\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'This study investigates possible variation in post-mortem histories during the Neolithic period in southwestern Sweden based on microscopic studies of human bone. Numerous megalithic graves were built in this region and good preservation conditions have left a rich skeletal record. After more than a hundred years of research, it is still a controversy whether or not these skeletal assemblages were the result of primary burials, or ossuaries where skeletonized remains were deposited. In this study we apply histological analysis to obtain insights into post-mortem histories and taphonomic processes affecting the human remains, potentially including funerary rituals. This type of analysis records the condition and traces of degradation found in skeletal material at a microscopic level. Human skeletal material from four different megalithic tombs in the Falbygden area has been sampled and analysed by thin-section light microscopy, and by scanning electron microscopy. The results of the study provide evidence of variation and changes in burial conditions for skeletal remains from the different graves, also for remains from the same grave. Extent of bioerosion varied, from extensive to moderate/arrested, to none. Bone samples from the same graves also differed in the type of staining and mineral inclusions, showing that the non-bioeroded samples relatively early post-mortem must have experienced an anoxic environment, and later a change to an aerated environment. This could be taken as an indication of primary burial somewhere else, but more likely reflect a special micro-environment occurring temporarily in some graves and parts of graves after the tombs were filled with soil and sealed by roof slabs. The study illustrates the usefulness of bone histological analysis in the reconstruction of post-mortem histories, revealing variations not discernible at macro-level that may aid in the interpretations of funerary rituals. However, the results also highlight the issues of equifinality. Based on current data and knowledge, several scenarios are possible. Further histotaphonomic work is advisable, including archaeological remains from megalithic tombs, and bones from taphonomic experiments.\\'\"',\n",

On examination she was psychotic and had a postural and rest tremor of the upper limbs, cogwheel rigidity of the four limbs, retropulsion on standing position, and inability to walk. During the following 2 weeks she developed xerostomia and unilateral parotiditis that improved with steroids. A simultaneous improvement of the cognitive abilities allowed for the detection of sensory ataxia of the lower limbs. Sensory ganglionopathy was then detected with electrophysiological studies. A diagnosis of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome was suspected and confirmed by salivary gland scintigraphy, Schirmer\\'s test, and submaxillary gland biopsy. We report a case of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome associated with central and peripheral nervous system involvement, without <i>sicca</i> symptoms preceding the neurological clinical picture. The coexistence of ganglionopathy and a favourable response to immunosuppression are key features that can lead to the correct diagnosis in cases with atypical CNS symptoms, mimicking a rapidly progressive dementia.\\\\\"\"',\n",

The enzymatic tools for the generation of Fab fragments have been discovered through basic research within the field of molecular bacterial pathogenesis. Today, these enzymes are widely applied as research tools and in this chapter, we describe methodologies based on bacterial enzymes to generate Fab fragments from both human and mouse IgG. For all human IgG subclasses, the IdeS enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes has been applied to generate F(ab\\')2 fragments that subsequently can be reduced under mild conditions to generate a homogenous pool of Fab\\' fragments. The enzyme Kgp from Porphyromonas gingivalis has been applied to generate intact Fab fragments from human IgG1 and the Fab fragments can be purified using a CH1-specific affinity resin. The SpeB protease, also from S. pyogenes, is able to digest mouse IgGs and has been applied to digest antibodies and Fab fragments can be purified on light chain affinity resins. In this chapter, we describe methodologies that can be used to obtain Fab fragments from human and mouse IgG using bacterial proteases.\\\\\"\"',\n",

The cumulative incidence of PD was 1.95% higher in the SS cohort than in the non-SS cohort. The SS cohort had an elevated HR under medication use, namely cevimeline and pilocarpine (crude HR, 1.28), hydroxychloroquine (crude HR, 1.43; aHR, 1.46), and methylprednisolone (crude HR, 2.21; aHR, 1.49).

The risk of PD was higher (aHR, 2.20) in patients with SS without comorbidities than in those with comorbidities. The aHR of PD significantly increased when the follow-up period exceeded 9 years (aHR, 1.93).We determined an increased risk of PD in patients with SS.

       " '\"\\\\\"Mutations in the gene coding for membrane-bound fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) lead to toxic accumulation of lipid species and development of the Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS), a rare disorder characterized by skin defects and mental retardation. Here, we present the crystallographic structure of human FALDH, the first model of a membrane-associated aldehyde dehydrogenase. The dimeric FALDH displays a previously unrecognized element in its C-terminal region, a \\'gatekeeper\\' helix, which extends over the adjacent subunit, controlling the access to the substrate cavity and helping orientate both substrate cavities towards the membrane surface for efficient substrate transit between membranes and catalytic site. Activity assays demonstrate that the gatekeeper helix is important for directing the substrate specificity of FALDH towards long-chain fatty aldehydes. The gatekeeper feature is conserved across membrane-associated aldehyde dehydrogenases.

The aim of this study was to see whether we could find benefit from LMWH bridging. We studied all planned interruptions of warfarin within the Swedish anticoagulation register Auricula during 2006 to 2011. Low-molecular-weight heparin bridging was compared to nonbridging (control) after propensity score matching. Complications were identified in national clinical registers for 30 days following warfarin cessation, and defined as all-cause mortality, bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, or other), or thrombosis (ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, venous thromboembolism, or myocardial infarction) that was fatal or required hospital care. Of the 14 556 identified warfarin interruptions, 12 659 with a known medical background had a mean age of 69 years, 61% were males, mean CHADS<sub>2</sub> (1 point for each of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \\\\u226575 years, diabetes, and 2 points for stroke or transient ischemic attack) score was 1.7, and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 3.4. The total number of LMWH bridgings was 7021. Major indications for anticoagulation were mechanical heart valve prostheses 4331, atrial fibrillation 1097, and venous thromboembolism 1331. Bridging patients had a higher rate of thrombotic events overall. Total risk of any complication did not differ significantly between bridging (1.5%) and nonbridging (1.2%). Regardless of indication for warfarin treatment, we found no benefit from bridging. The type of procedure prompting bridging was not known, and the likely reason for the observed higher risk of thrombosis with LMWH bridging is that low-risk procedures more often meant no bridging. Results from randomized trials are needed, especially for patients with mechanical heart valves.\\'\"',\n",

The aim of this study was to describe parental conceptions of rotavirus infection and vaccination during its implementation as part of the child immunization program, as their support is vital for any new vaccine. The study followed a descriptive, qualitative design with a phenomenographic approach. Ten in-depth interviews with parents were conducted in Stockholm County, transcribed and analyzed to describe qualitatively different conceptions of rotavirus infection and vaccination. Four main categories were identified: to vaccinate without doubt, hesitant to vaccinate, risky to vaccinate, and unnecessary to vaccinate. All the parents had in common the desire to protect their children from suffering, either by vaccinating their child in order to avoid rotavirus infection or by not vaccinating their child because of concerns about the side effects.

With the use of a primary murine culture model, we found that GCs are highly sensitive to IFN-\\\\u03b3 with significantly reduced proliferation and altered structure with low concentrations. GC cultures treated with IFN-\\\\u03b3 have increased gene expression of Muc2 and Muc5AC but do not express these mucin glycoproteins. We hypothesized that IFN-\\\\u03b3 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in GCs.

Increased GRP78 and sXBP1 expression was found in experimental dry eye and Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome models and was GC specific. Increased GRP78 was also found in the conjunctiva of patients with Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome at the gene and protein levels.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune disorder causing dry mouth, adversely affects the overall oral health in patients. Activation of innate immune responses and excessive production of type I interferons (IFNs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Recognition of nucleic acids by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors is a major trigger for the induction of type I IFNs. Upon activation, cytosolic DNA sensors can interact with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, and activation of STING causes increased expression of type I IFNs. The role of STING activation in SS is not known. In this study, to investigate whether the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway influences SS development, female C57BL/6 mice were injected with a STING agonist, dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). Salivary glands (SGs) were studied for gene expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. SG function was evaluated by measuring pilocarpine-induced salivation. Sera were analyzed for cytokines and autoantibodies. Primary SG cells were used to study the expression and activation of STING. Our data show that systemic DMXAA treatment rapidly induced the expression of Ifnb1, Il6, and Tnfa in the SGs, and these cytokines were also elevated in circulation. In contrast, increased Ifng gene expression was dominantly detected in the SGs. The type I innate lymphoid cells present within the SGs were the major source of IFN-\\\\u03b3, and their numbers increased significantly within 3 d of treatment. STING expression in SGs was mainly observed in ductal and interstitial cells. In primary SG cells, DMXAA activated STING and induced IFN-\\\\u03b2 production. The DMXAA-treated mice developed autoantibodies, sialoadenitis, and glandular hypofunction. Our study demonstrates that activation of the STING pathway holds the potential to initiate SS. Thus, apart from viral infections, conditions that cause cellular perturbations and accumulation of host DNA within the cytosol should also be considered as possible triggers for SS.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren Syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. Lymphomas complicating pSS are mostly low-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, predominantly of marginal zone histological type. Mucosal localization is predominant, notably mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. Lymphomas often develop in organs where pSS is active, such as salivary glands. Germinal centre (GC)-like structures, high TNFSF13B (BAFF) and Flt3-ligand (FLT3LG) levels and genetic impairment of TNFAIP3 are new predictors of lymphoma development. These new findings allow a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms leading to lymphoma. We propose the following scenario: auto-immune B cells with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity are continuously stimulated by immune complexes containing antibodies against more specific auto-antigens, such as SSA/Ro, SSB/La or others. Germline abnormality of TNFAIP3 leads to a decreased control of the NF-kB pathway and thus promotes survival of B cells and oncogenic mutations especially in GC structure. Moreover, B cells are stimulated by a positive loop of activation induced by BAFF secretion. Thus, lymphomagenesis associated with pSS exemplifies the development of antigen-driven B-cell lymphoma. The control of disease activity by a well-targeted immunosuppressor is the primary objective of the management of the patient in order to repress chronic B cell stimulation. \\'\"',\n",

Woozy mice carrying a spontaneous Sil1 mutation recapitulate key pathological features of MSS, including cerebellar atrophy with degeneration of Purkinje cells and progressive myopathy. Because the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response is activated in degenerating neurons of woozy mice, and inhibiting PERK-mediated translational attenuation has shown protective effects in protein-misfolding neurodegenerative disease models, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of GSK2606414, a potent inhibitor of PERK. Mice were chronically treated with GSK2606414 starting from a presymptomatic stage, and the effects were evaluated on biochemical, histopathological and clinical readouts. GSK2606414 delayed Purkinje cell degeneration and the onset of motor deficits, prolonging the asymptomatic phase of the disease; it also reduced the skeletal muscle abnormalities and improved motor performance during the symptomatic phase. The protein but not the mRNA level of ORP150, a nucleotide exchange factor which can substitute for SIL1, was increased in the cerebellum of GSK2606414-treated woozy mice, suggesting that translational recovery promoted the synthesis of this alternative BiP co-factor.

In the 1990s, a study of liver involvement in patients with primary SS integrated the evaluation of clinical signs of liver disease, liver function and a complete panel of autoantibodies. Recent developments in the field of hepatic and viral diseases have significantly changed the diagnostic approach to liver involvement in SS. The most recent studies have shown that, after eliminating hepatotoxic drugs and fatty liver disease, the two main causes of liver disease in primary SS are chronic viral infections and autoimmune liver diseases. The differential diagnosis of liver disease in primary SS (viral vs autoimmune) is clinically important, since the two processes require different therapeutic approaches and have different prognoses. With respect to viral infections, chronic HCV infection is the main cause of liver involvement in SS patients from the Mediterranean area, while chronic HBV infection may be the main cause of liver involvement in SS patients from Asian countries. After eliminating viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) should be considered the main cause of liver disease in primary SS. PBC-related SS patients may have a broad spectrum of abnormalities of the liver, including having no clinical or analytical data suggestive of liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is the second most frequently found autoimmune liver disease to be associated with SS (all reported cases are type I), and nearly 10% of these patients have an AIH-PBC overlap.

The eclectic permutation of peripheral nervous system (PNS) syndromes which occur in Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients are among the most common and severe extraglandular complications. This review article highlights the evaluation, differential diagnosis, immunopathogenic mechanisms, and potential treatment options of these PNS complications encountered by neurologists. The sensory neuropathies constitute the most frequent PNS complication. Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients can suffer from severe neuropathic pain, with small-fiber neuropathy causing lancinating or burning pain which can disproportionately affect the proximal torso or extremities, and the face (ie, in a \\\\\"non-length-dependent distribution\\\\\"). The technique of skin biopsy, assessing for the intraepidermal nerve fiber density of unmyelinated nerves, provides a useful technique for neurologists to diagnose small-fiber neuropathies, especially when there is such a non-length-dependent distribution. Other diagnostic techniques (ie, electromyography/nerve-conduction studies, evoked potentials, nerve and muscle biopsy) may be useful in specific subtypes of neuropathies. A rational approach to treatment requires a careful appraisal of the clinical subtype of the neuropathy, as well as a familiarity with such discriminating immunopathogenic mechanisms. The application of the traditional armamentarium used for neuropathic pain can be especially challenging. Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients can suffer from debilitating fatigue, sicca symptoms, and autonomic findings; as such manifestations can be complications of various neuropathic agents, neurologists should understand how to minimize such iatrogenic complications. Therefore, this article will empower neurologists to more effectively collaborate with rheumatologists, in the diagnosis and treatment of Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients with PNS complications.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'A suppressor mutagenesis screen was conducted in order to identify second site mutations that could reverse the extreme hypersensitivity to aluminium (Al) seen for the Arabidopsis mutant, als3-1. From this screen, it was found that a loss-of-function mutation in the previously described SUV2 (SENSITIVE TO UV 2), which encodes a putative plant ATRIP homologue that is a component of the ATR-dependent cell checkpoint response, reversed the als3-1 phenotype. This included prevention of hallmarks associated with als3-1 including Al-dependent terminal differentiation of the root tip and transition to endoreduplication. From this analysis, SUV2 was determined to be required for halting cell cycle progression and triggering loss of the quiescent centre (QC) following exposure to Al. In conjunction with this, SUV2 was found to have a similar role as ATR, ALT2 and SOG1 in Al-dependent stoppage of root growth, all of which are required for promotion of expression of a suite of genes that likely are part of an Al-dependent DNA damage transcriptional response. This work argues that these Al response factors work together to detect Al-dependent damage and subsequently activate a DNA damage response pathway that halts the cell cycle and subsequently promotes QC differentiation and entrance into endocycling.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Excised rat intestinal tissue mounted in an Ussing chamber can be used for intestinal permeability assessments in drug development. The outer layer of the intestine, the serosa and part of the muscle layer, is traditionally removed since it is considered a barrier to the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen as well as to that of pharmaceutical substances. However, the procedure for removing the serosal-muscle layer, i.e. stripping, is a technically challenging process in the pre-experimental preparation of the tissue which may result in tissue damage and reduced viability of the segment. In this study, the viability of stripped and native (non-stripped) rat small intestine tissue segments mounted in Ussing chambers was monitored and the apparent permeability of the tissue to a set of test compounds across both tissue preparations was determined. Electrical measurements, in particular the potential difference (PD) across the intestinal membrane, were used to evaluate the viability. In this study, there were no differences in initial PD (health status of the tissue) or PD over time (viability throughout the experiment) between native and stripped rat jejunum segments. Overall, there were also no significant differences in permeability between stripped and native rat intestinal tissue for the compounds in this study. Based on these results, we propose that stripping can be excluded from the preparation procedures for rat jejunal tissue for permeability studies when using the Ussing chamber technique. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"The accuracy of predictive equations for calculating resting energy expenditure (REE) in elderly people has been questioned. Aging is associated with progressive declines in REE, which partly is explained by loss of fat free mass (FFM). Against this background we aimed to identify the most accurate predictive equation for REE in octogenarian men, taking body composition into account and using indirect calorimetry as reference value. REE was measured in 22 men (mean age 82.6\\\\u00b10.3years) and compared with six predictive equations: two based on FFM and four based on body weight, height and/or age. FFM was derived from Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses. Spearman\\'s rank correlations showed a moderate to high positive monotonic correlation (r=0.62 to 0.79) between measured and calculated REE (all p<0.005).The mean calculated REE was significantly different from measured REE for all equations except Mifflin-St Jeor. A calculated REE within 10% of measured REE was considered acceptable and the equations of Mifflin-St Jeor, WHO and Harris-Benedict captured 64%, 50% and 45% of the participant, respectively. The Mifflin-St Jeor equation had the lowest root mean square error (138kcal), followed by the equation by Harris-Benedict (189kcal) and WHO (220kcal). The equations from Luhrmann, Henry and Cunningham predicted REE rather poorly in our study subjects, with e.g. <40% of the individuals within 10% of measured REE. Our results indicate that the Mifflin-St Jeor equation (using FFM) is the most accurate equation estimating REE in these octogenarian men.

       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS) is a prototypical autoimmune disease. The involvement of B cells in the pathogenesis of pSS has long been suspected on the basis of clinical observations that include the presence of serum autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinaemia, increased levels of free light chains and increased risk of B cell lymphoma. Moreover, the composition of the B cell subset is altered in pSS. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms that support the increased activation of B cells in pSS, including genetic and epigenetic factors and environmental triggers that promote B cell activation via the innate immune system. B cell activating factor (BAFF, also known as TNF ligand superfamily member 13B) is at the crossroads of this process. An important role also exists for the target tissue (exocrine glands, namely the salivary and lachrymal glands), which promotes local B cell activation. This continuous stimulation of B cells is the main driver of lymphomatous escape. Identification of the multiple steps that support B cell activation has led to the development of promising targeted therapies that will hopefully lead to the development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for pSS.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a wide clinical spectrum that extends from sicca symptoms of the mucosal surfaces to extra-glandular systemic manifestations. Understanding of the pathophysiology of primary SS has advanced over recent years, and this, in turn, has presented new targeted treatment options. We provide a brief, up-to-date description of the pathophysiology of SS and the main etiopathogenic pathways implicated in the disease process and review clinical evidence in support of new treatment options targeting these pathways, highlighting successes and failures, and concluding with a summary of gaps in knowledge and where future research should be focused. Direct and indirect B-cell targeted therapies are currently the most promising biological agents in primary SS, especially for systemic involvement, but other pathways (T-cell co-stimulation, cytokine-based therapies, intracellular pathways and gene therapies) are under development. The next 10\\\\\\\\xa0years may witness a disruptive therapeutic scenario in primary SS.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'We report a case of a 67 year-old man with bilateral sensory ataxia of the upper extremities. He was diagnosed as having ANCA-related angitis and Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome at age 60. On admission to our hospital at age 67, he presented with severe sensory ataxia in his upper extremities, while his lower extremity neurological symptoms were limited to the absence of tendon reflexes. Cervical MRI showed an increased T2 signal intensity in an area limited to the bilateral cuneate fasciculus. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid were normal. Plasma homocysteine, serum and urine methylmalonic acid were also normal. Eight-week intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 did not improve either his disorder or the MRI findings. His sensory ataxia might be attributed to Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome-associated ganglionopathy at the cervical level, and the MRI findings might reflect centripetal Wallerian degeneration in the cuneate fasciculus. Gracilis fasciculus are well-known as vulnerable regions in Sj\\\\u00f6gren-associated myelopathy, whereas cervical myelopathy, limited to cuneate fascicules, can emerge as Sj\\\\u00f6gren-associated disorders.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"Sjogren\\'s Syndrome (SS) is a chronic, female overwhelming fundamental issue of an immune system rheumatic sickness that influences the whole body. It is described by lymphocytic invasion of the exocrine viz. salivary and lacrimal glands and by surprising B-cell hyperactivity. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) and Stomatitis sicca (oral dryness) are the primary visual appearances of SS. The primary SS is recognized from secondary SS which happens as a piece of other immune system maladies. The secondary SS exists together particularly with fundamental lupus erythematosus (15- 36%), rheumatoid joint inflammation (20- 32%) and also restricted and progressive systemic sclerosis (11- 24%), less as often as possible with different sclerosis and immune system hepatitis and thyreoiditis. We assess changes in salivary epidermal growth factor (EGF) intensity and estimate the relationship between salivary EGF levels and the seriousness of intraoral symptoms in SS individuals. The outcomes demonstrated that the salivary EGF levels diminished with the movement of SS, and this crumbling in salivation quality and additionally, hyposalivation could imagine a vital constituent in the pathogenesis of refractory intraoral indication in SS suffering patients. A strong relationship between particular alleles of the MHC and SS improvement has been recommended. The primary hereditary examination on SS revealed a relationship amongst SS and HLA-DR3 in SS population. Subsequent reports featured the relationship amongst SS and the HLA-D locus, with a diverse distribution between primary SS and secondary SS. The motivation behind this manuscript is to give a concise survey on the molecular mechanism, effects of infectious agents and genetic factors in the etiology of Sjogren\\'s Syndrome. Such effects are discussed independently.\\\\\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Regulators of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their discovery. The unveiling of this new family of negative regulators of G protein signalling in the mid-1990s solved a persistent conundrum in the G protein signalling field, in which the rate of deactivation of signalling cascades in vivo could not be replicated in exogenous systems. Since then, there has been tremendous advancement in the knowledge of RGS protein structure, function, regulation and their role as novel drug targets. RGS proteins play an important modulatory role through their GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity at active, GTP-bound G\\\\u03b1 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. They also possess many non-canonical functions not related to G protein signalling. Here, an update on the status of RGS proteins as drug targets is provided, highlighting advances that have led to the inclusion of RGS proteins in the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY database of drug targets.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an epithelial injury surrounded by dense lymphocytic infiltrates. The conditions for the long-term maintenance of human salivary gland epithelial cells from pSS patients and a co-culture system with pSS lymphocytes were used to assess the effect of Rituximab (RTX) on the inflammatory condition and progression in pSS. Quantitative real-time PCR, genes and protein array analysis, Western blot, flow cytometry, small interfering RNA transfection and nuclear factor-\\\\u03baB (NF-\\\\u03baB) DNA binding assays were used as methods. Supporting the benefits of RTX, this study demonstrates that RTX decreases NF-\\\\u03baB activity and interrupts the NF-\\\\u03baB signalling pathway through the up-regulation of the Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP). Over-expression of RKIP down-regulates interleukins, their receptors and the expression of genes encodes proteins that attracted lymphocytes. Silencing of the RKIP gene leads to significantly increased expression and release of pro-inflammatory mediators supporting that RKIP expression could be involved in the suppression of NF-\\\\u03baB activation in pSS salivary gland epithelial cells. \\'\"',\n",

We aimed to examine the levels of autophagy markers in tear film and conjunctival epithelial cells from SS dry eye patients, and analyze their correlations with clinical features. Patients with SS dry eye exhibited lower Schirmer values, lower tear breakup time, and higher ocular staining scores. In tears, ATG5 and LC3B-II/I levels were significantly higher in SS dry eye. ATG5 and LC3B-II mRNA in the conjunctiva were also elevated in SS dry eye compared with non-SS dry eye. The immunostaining of conjunctival epithelium showed a punctate pattern of ATG5 and LC3B-II in SS dry eye. These staining patterns were also observed in the lacrimal gland of SS animal models. ATG5 levels in tears and the conjunctival epithelium strongly correlated with ocular staining scores, and one month of topical corticosteroid treatment reduced both ATG5 and LC3B-II/I levels in tear film and the conjunctival epithelium of patients with SS dry eye. Our results suggest that autophagy is enhanced or dysregulated in SS and autophagy markers may be serve as both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in SS dry eye.\\'\"',\n",

In this study, molecular investigations including sequencing of the SIL1 gene, western blotting and microscopic investigations in fibroblast cultures were carried out in a cohort of 15 patients from 14 unrelated families, including the large, inbred family reported by Superneau et al., having the clinical features of MSS to provide insights into the pathophysiology of the disorder. A total of seven different mutations were found in eight of the patients from seven families. The mutations caused loss of the BIP-associated protein (BAP) protein in four patients by western blot. Novel clinical features such as dental abnormalities, iris coloboma, eczema and hormonal abnormalities were noticed in some patients, but there was no clear way to distinguish those with and without SIL1 mutations. Cultured fibroblasts contained numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, similar to those identified in the brain of the whoozy mouse in five unrelated patients, three with and two without SIL1 mutations, suggesting some SIL1 negative patients share a common cellular pathogenesis with those who are SIL1 positive.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'BACKGROUND Eye and mouth dryness are the most common symptoms reported during ophthalmological and dental examinations, and their frequency increases with age. In connection with population aging and the huge variety of factors and conditions that can induce this condition, it is becoming a serious and growing problem. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether ocular dryness and concomitant xerostomia is associated with particular systemic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 642 non-Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients referred for examination to the ophthalmology or dental clinic of Lublin region, Poland. The research was conducted using a standardized interview: The Interview and Examination Questionnaire. All patients responded to the survey questions, which concerned systemic diseases, lifestyle, with special emphasis on computer work, spending time in polluted and air-conditioned rooms, and subsequent questions about the subjective symptoms of ocular and mouth dryness. RESULTS There were 424 patients who presented signs and symptoms of both ocular and mouth dryness. Our study showed a statistically significant association between this condition and the age and sex of the patients and systemic diseases such as hypertension (p=0.0000), cardiovascular disease (p=0.057), and stress (p=0.036), and time spent at the computer (p=0.00015). CONCLUSIONS Ocular dryness and concomitant xerostomia may occur in apparently healthy individuals, but is more frequent in patients with systemic disorders. The lack of dry eye and dry mouth symptoms does not exclude insufficient tearing and salivation; thus, the disorders are usually underestimated. Our study indicates that ocular and mouth dryness are the most common conditions seen in out-patients, due to increased use of medications, computers, and air conditioning.\\'\"',\n",

The aim of this study was to identify functional epitopes for the anti-AQP5 autoantibodies detected in control subjects and patients with SS. Recognition of epitopes by anti-AQP5 autoantibodies in sera ( n = 13 for control and n = 24 for SS) or purified IgG ( n = 1 for control and n = 3 for SS) was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay performed in the presence or absence of peptides corresponding to the second transmembrane helix and extracellular loops A, C, and E of AQP5. Functional epitopes were determined by measuring the effects of purified IgG and neutralizing peptides on transepithelial osmotic permeability (P<sub>f</sub><sup>T</sup>) of MDCK cells expressing AQP5. In the IIF assay, 89% of SS samples were inhibited by at least 1 peptide, while only half of control samples were inhibited by any peptide. Overall, SS samples were inhibited by peptides corresponding to extracellular loops A, C, and E by 40% to 50%, whereas control samples were inhibited only by peptides corresponding to loop E by <20%. A cyclized peptide (E1) mimicking loop E was most frequently recognized and best differentiated between the SS and control samples. Incubation of MDCK-AQP5 cells with SS but not with control IgG, significantly decreased P<sub>f</sub><sup>T</sup>, which was reversed by neutralization of IgG binding to any of the extracellular loops. In conclusion, the anti-AQP5 autoantibodies detected in control and SS groups showed differences in fine specificity to the functional epitopes of AQP5. The prevalent recognition of functional epitopes by anti-AQP5 autoantibodies from SS patients suggests that anti-AQP5 autoantibodies act as mediators of glandular hypofunction and are a potential therapeutic target in SS.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Enzymes that affect glycoproteins of the human immune system, and thereby modulate defense responses, are abundant among bacterial pathogens. Two endoglycosidases from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, EndoS and EndoS2, have recently been shown to hydrolyze N-linked glycans of human immunoglobulin G. However, detailed characterization and comparison of the hydrolyzing activities have not been performed. In the present study, we set out to characterize the enzymes by comparing the activities of EndoS and EndoS2 on a selection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cetuximab, adalimumab, panitumumab and denosumab. By analyzing the glycans hydrolyzed by EndoS and EndoS2 from the antibodies using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight, we found that both the enzymes cleaved complex glycans and that EndoS2 hydrolyzed hybrid and oligomannose structures to a greater extent compared with EndoS. A comparison of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) profiles of the glycan pool of cetuximab hydrolyzed with EndoS and EndoS2 showed that EndoS2 hydrolyzed hybrid and oligomannose glycans, whereas these peaks were missing in the EndoS chromatogram. We utilized this difference in glycoform selectivity, in combination with the IdeS protease, and developed a LC separation method to quantify high mannose content in the Fc fragments of the selected mAbs. We conclude that EndoS and EndoS2 hydrolyze different glycoforms from the Fc-glycosylation site on therapeutic mAbs and that this can be used for rapid quantification of high mannose content. \\'\"',\n",

In addition, we also further discuss aspects related to differences in in silico models and the potential implications of such differences. Our original report should be viewed as the starting point in a thorough and transparent review of absorption prediction models with the overall aim of improving their application as validated tools for bridging studies of active pharmaceutical ingredients from various sources and origins in a regulatory context.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the exocrine glands (mainly the salivary and lacrimal glands) and results in the severe dryness of mucosal surfaces, principally in the mouth and eyes. This disease predominantly affects middle-aged women, but can also be observed in children, men and the elderly. The clinical presentation of SjS is heterogeneous and can vary from sicca symptoms to systemic disease (characterized by peri-epithelial lymphocytic infiltration of the affected tissue or the deposition of the immune complex) and lymphoma. The mechanism underlying the development of SjS is the destruction of the epithelium of the exocrine glands, as a consequence of abnormal B cell and T cell responses to the autoantigens Ro/SSA and La/SSB, among others. Diagnostic criteria for SjS include the detection of autoantibodies in patient serum and histological analysis of biopsied salivary gland tissue. Therapeutic approaches for SjS include both topical and systemic treatments to manage the sicca and systemic symptoms of disease. SjS is a serious disease with excess mortality, mainly related to the systemic involvement of disease and the development of lymphomas in some patients. Knowledge of SjS has progressed substantially, but this disease is still characterized by sicca symptoms, the systemic involvement of disease, lymphocytic infiltration to exocrine glands, the presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies and the increased risk of lymphoma in patients with SjS.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes cohesin and condensin and the Smc5/6 complex (Smc5/6) are crucial for chromosome dynamics and stability. All contain essential ATPase domains, and cohesin and condensin interact with chromosomes through topological entrapment of DNA. However, how Smc5/6 binds DNA and chromosomes has remained largely unknown. Here, we show that purified Smc5/6 binds DNA through a mechanism that requires ATP hydrolysis by the complex and circular DNA to be established. This also promotes topoisomerase 2-dependent catenation of plasmids, suggesting that Smc5/6 interconnects two DNA molecules using ATP-regulated topological entrapment of DNA, similar to cohesin. We also show that a complex containing an Smc6 mutant that is defective in ATP binding fails to interact with DNA and chromosomes and leads to cell death with concomitant accumulation of DNA damage when overexpressed. Taken together, these results indicate that Smc5/6 executes its cellular functions through ATP-regulated intermolecular DNA linking.\\'\"',\n",

White matter hyperintensities were present in 21 patients and 18 controls. Only age was significantly associated with WMHs in both groups (p < .0001). The increase in systolic-diastolic ratio significantly correlates with neuropsychological impairment. Anti-SSA autoantibodies positively correlate with impaired systolic-diastolic ratio and with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The correlation between haemodynamic changes and anti-SSA autoantibodies suggests a role for the autoimmune response in determining early cerebral hemodynamic dysfunctions. The functional impairment of the endothelium may play a pivotal role in vasomotor dysfunction before any organic damage. The subsequent structural damage of the arterial wall may be responsible for the increase in resistances in small cerebral arteries and sustained hypoperfusion.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'N<sup>1</sup>-Acetylspermine oxidase (APAO) catalyzes the conversion of N<sup>1</sup>-acetylspermine or N<sup>1</sup>-acetylspermidine to spermidine or putrescine, respectively, with concomitant formation of N-acetyl-3-aminopropanal and hydrogen peroxide. Here we present the structure of murine APAO in its oxidized holo form and in complex with substrate. The structures provide a basis for understanding molecular details of substrate interaction in vertebrate APAO, highlighting a key role for an asparagine residue in coordinating the N<sup>1</sup>-acetyl group of the substrate. We applied computational methods to the crystal structures to rationalize previous observations with regard to the substrate charge state. The analysis suggests that APAO features an active site ideally suited for binding of charged polyamines. We also reveal the structure of APAO in complex with the irreversible inhibitor MDL72527. In addition to the covalent adduct, a second MDL72527 molecule is bound in the active site. Binding of MDL72527 is accompanied by altered conformations in the APAO backbone. On the basis of structures of APAO, we discuss the potential for development of specific inhibitors.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) has recently emerged as a new proxy for reconstructing past vegetation, but its taphonomy, source area and representation biases need better assessment. We investigated how sedDNA in recent sediments of two small Scottish lakes reflects a major vegetation change, using well-documented 20<sup>th</sup> Century plantations of exotic conifers as an experimental system. We used next-generation sequencing to barcode sedDNA retrieved from subrecent lake sediments. For comparison, pollen was analysed from the same samples. The sedDNA record contains 73 taxa (mainly genus or species), all but one of which are present in the study area. Pollen and sedDNA shared 35% of taxa, which partly reflects a difference in source area. More aquatic taxa were recorded in sedDNA, whereas taxa assumed to be of regional rather than local origin were recorded only as pollen. The chronology of the sediments and planting records are well aligned, and sedDNA of exotic conifers appears in high quantities with the establishment of plantations around the lakes. SedDNA recorded other changes in local vegetation that accompanied afforestation. There were no signs of DNA leaching in the sediments or DNA originating from pollen.\\'\"',\n",

In 20% of cases, ILD can be diagnosed before pSS; anyway, few studies have investigated the frequency of ILD as the first clinically relevant manifestation of pSS, generally referred to retrospective studies. Aim of our prospective study was to describe prevalence, clinical, serological, and instrumental features of non-sicca onset pSS patients with interstitial lung involvement. During a period of 48\\\\\\\\xa0months, all consecutive patients diagnosed as pSS were enrolled. For all patients, the reason for the first visit was recorded. When present, ILD was categorized as definite, possible, or inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, according to the current criteria. ILD was the main presenting symptom in 13/77 new diagnoses of pSS patients; in particular, 6/13 patients were initially diagnosed as idiopathic ILD, and only later developed clinical manifestations suggestive for pSS; ILD-pSS patients were older than others and showed a higher EULAR primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome disease activity index. A radiologic definite or possible UIP pattern was detected in 12/13 pSS. For the first time, we prospectively observed a prevalence of 16.8% of non-sicca onset pSS patients with ILD. Interestingly, UIP pattern was the most frequently detected, while typical autoantibodies were often absent. These features stressed the importance of differential diagnosis in the first stage of the disease, considering the possible poorer prognosis in this subgroup of patients.

       " '\"\\\\\"Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are complex diseases characterized by persistent or recurrent inflammation, alteration of immune response, and production of specific autoantibodies. It is known that different AIDs share several susceptibility genetic loci. Tumor necrosis factor alpha inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3) encodes the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20, which downregulates inflammation by restricting NF-<i>\\\\u03ba</i>B, a transcription factor that regulates expression of various proinflammatory genes. Variants in <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene have been described as associated with susceptibility to several AIDs. Here, we analyzed two <i>TNFAIP3</i> polymorphisms in Italian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and primary Sjogren\\'s syndrome (pSS), to verify if the genetic variability of <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene is involved in genetic predisposition to AIDs also in the Italian population. We recruited 313 SLE patients, 256 RA patients, 195 pSS patients, and 236 healthy controls. Genotyping of rs2230926 and rs6920220 in <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene was performed by an allelic discrimination assay. We carried out a case/control association study and a genotype/phenotype correlation analysis. A higher risk to develop SLE was observed for rs2230926 (<i>P</i> = 0.02, OR = 1.92). No association was observed between this SNP and the susceptibility to pSS or RA. However, the rs2230926 variant allele seems to confer a higher risk to develop lymphoma in pSS patients, while in RA patients, the presence of RF resulted significantly associated with the variant allele. Regarding the rs6920220 SNP, we observed a significant association of the variant allele with SLE (<i>P</i> = 0.03, OR = 1.53), pSS (<i>P</i> = 0.016, OR = 1.69), and RA (<i>P</i> = 0.0001, OR = 2.35) susceptibility. Furthermore, SLE patients carrying the variant allele showed a higher risk to develop pericarditis, pleurisy, and kidney complications. Our results support the importance of the <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene variant role in the development of different autoimmune diseases in the Italian population and furtherly confirm a sharing of genetic predisposing factors among these three pathologies.\\\\\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'The SUMO ligase Mms21, which is a subunit of the Smc5/6 complex, is required for DNA repair. Here we present results showing that Mms21 was phosophorylated during S-phase in a manner dependent on the DNA damage kinase Mec1. Phosphorylation of Mms21 occurred in unchallenged cells, but was more abundant in the presence of DNA damaging agents. Mass spectrometry identified five phosphorylated serines organized in two regions of Mms21, and two C-terminal serines, S260 and S261, formed part of a Mec1/Tel1 consensus motif. Nonphosphorylatable substitutions of the C-terminal serines, inactivation of Mec1 or removal of the Mms21 C-terminus all abolished Mms21 phosphorylation. Additionally, strains carrying Mms21 phosphoablative alleles displayed reduced SUMO ligase activity, sensitivity to MMS and an increased rate of chromosome loss in the presence of MMS. We propose that one function of S260 S261 phosphorylation is to positively regulate the SUMO ligase activity of Mms21 and thereby promote genomic stability. \\'\"',\n",

In pSS, the prevalence of cognitive disorders is generally sparse across literature and the impact of pain on cognitive profile is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between pain, cognitive complaint, and impairment in a very homogenous population of 10 pSS patients with painful small fiber neuropathy (PSFN) and spontaneous cognitive complaint. Neurological exam, neuropsychological assessment, clinical evaluation measuring pain level, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitive complaint were performed. Our results showed that 100% of patients had cognitive dysfunction especially in executive domain (80%). The most sensitive test was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), abnormal in 70% of our population. Moreover, we found clear cut significant correlations between pain levels and 3 measures of WCST: the number of errors (R\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a-0.768, P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a.0062), perseverations (R\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a0.831, P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a.0042), and categories (R\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a0.705, P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a.02). In the literature review, the impact of pain is underexplored and results could be discordant. In a homogeneous cohort of pSS patients with PSFN, a cognitive complaint seems to be a valid reflection of cognitive dysfunction marked by a specific executive profile found with the WCST. In this preliminary study, this profile is linked to the level of pain and highlights that an appropriate management of pain control and a cognitive readaptation in patients could improve the quality of life.\\'\"',\n",

Then ultrasound was used to assess entheseal and tendon sites of these patients (n = 208) and controls (n = 117).

       " '\"\\'Gastrointestinal (GI) drug absorption is a complex process determined by formulation, physicochemical and biopharmaceutical factors, and GI physiology. Physiologically based in silico absorption models have emerged as a widely used and promising supplement to traditional in vitro assays and preclinical in vivo studies. However, there remains a lack of comparative studies between different models. The aim of this study was to explore the strengths and limitations of the in silico absorption models Simcyp 13.1, GastroPlus 8.0, and GI-Sim 4.1, with respect to their performance in predicting human intestinal drug absorption. This was achieved by adopting an a priori modeling approach and using well-defined input data for 12 drugs associated with incomplete GI absorption and related challenges in predicting the extent of absorption. This approach better mimics the real situation during formulation development where predictive in silico models would be beneficial. Plasma concentration-time profiles for 44 oral drug administrations were calculated by convolution of model-predicted absorption-time profiles and reported pharmacokinetic parameters. Model performance was evaluated by comparing the predicted plasma concentration-time profiles, Cmax, tmax, and exposure (AUC) with observations from clinical studies. The overall prediction accuracies for AUC, given as the absolute average fold error (AAFE) values, were 2.2, 1.6, and 1.3 for Simcyp, GastroPlus, and GI-Sim, respectively. The corresponding AAFE values for Cmax were 2.2, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively, and those for tmax were 1.7, 1.5, and 1.4, respectively. Simcyp was associated with underprediction of AUC and Cmax; the accuracy decreased with decreasing predicted fabs. A tendency for underprediction was also observed for GastroPlus, but there was no correlation with predicted fabs. There were no obvious trends for over- or underprediction for GI-Sim. The models performed similarly in capturing dependencies on dose and particle size. In conclusion, it was shown that all three software packages are useful to guide formulation development. However, as a consequence of the high fraction of inaccurate predictions (prediction error >2-fold) and the clear trend toward decreased accuracy with decreased predicted fabs observed with Simcyp, the results indicate that GI-Sim and GastroPlus perform better than Simcyp in predicting the intestinal absorption of the incompletely absorbed drugs when a higher degree of accuracy is needed. In addition, this study suggests that modeling and simulation research groups should perform systematic model evaluations using their own input data to maximize confidence in model performance and output.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Plasmalogens are a special class of ether-phospholipids, best recognized by their vinyl-ether bond at the sn-1 position of the glycerobackbone and by the observation that their deficiency causes rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP). The complex plasmalogen biosynthetic pathway involves multiple enzymatic steps carried-out in peroxisomes and in the endoplasmic reticulum. The rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens resides in the formation of the fatty alcohol responsible for the formation of an intermediate with an alkyl-linked moiety. The regulation in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens also takes place at this step using a feedback mechanism to stimulate or inhibit the biosynthesis. As such, fatty alcohols play a relevant role in the formation of ether-phospholipids. These advances in our understanding of complex lipid biosynthesis brought two seemingly distinct disorders into the spotlight. Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is caused by defects in the microsomal fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) leading to the accumulation of fatty alcohols and fatty aldehydes. In RCDP cells, the defect in plasmalogens is thought to generate a feedback signal to increase their biosynthesis, through the activity of fatty acid reductases to produce fatty alcohols. However, the enzymatic defects in either glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) or alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS) disrupt the biosynthesis and result in the accumulation of the fatty alcohols. A detailed characterization on the processes and enzymes that govern these intricate biosynthetic pathways, as well as, the metabolic characterization of defects along the pathway should increase our understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind these disorders. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have emerged as novel drug targets since their discovery almost two decades ago. RGS2 has received particular interest in cardiovascular research due to its role in regulating Gqsignaling in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. RGS2(-/-)mice are hypertensive, prone to heart failure, and display accelerated kidney fibrosis. RGS2 is rapidly degraded through the proteasome, and human mutations leading to accelerated RGS2 protein degradation correlate with hypertension. Hence, stabilizing RGS2 protein expression could be a novel route in treating cardiovascular disease. We previously identified cardiotonic steroids, including digoxin, as selective stabilizers of RGS2 protein in vitro. In the current study we investigated the functional effects of digoxin-mediated RGS2 protein stabilization in vivo. Using freshly isolated myocytes from wild-type and RGS2(-/-)mice treated with vehicle or low-dose digoxin (2\\\\u00b5g/kg/day for 7 days) we demonstrated that agonist-induced cAMP levels and cardiomyocyte contractility was inhibited by digoxin in wild-type but not in RGS2(-/-)mice. This inhibition was accompanied by an increase in RGS2 protein levels in cardiomyocytes as well as in whole heart tissue. Furthermore, digoxin had protective effects in a model of cardiac injury in wild-type mice and this protection was lost in RGS2(-/-)mice. Digoxin is the oldest known therapy for heart failure; however, beyond its activity at the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the exact mechanism of action is not known. The current study adds a novel mechanism, whereby through stabilizing RGS2 protein levels digoxin could exert its protective effects in the failing heart. \\'\"',\n",

Expression of mRNA encoding proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased in white adipose tissue of ArKO mice and was significantly higher than that in wild-type mice. Moreover, an increased number of inflammatory M1 macrophages was observed in white adipose tissue of ArKO mice. A significantly increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA expression of the salivary gland tissue in ArKO was found together with adiposity. Furthermore, the autoimmune lesions in a murine model of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome were exacerbated by administration of an aromatase inhibitor. These results suggest that aromatase may play a key role in the pathogenesis of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome-like lesions by controlling the target organ and adipose tissue-associated macrophage. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a rare congenital disease causing severe anaemia and progressive bone marrow failure. The majority of patients carry mutations in ribosomal proteins, which leads to depletion of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. As many as 40% of all DBA patients receive glucocorticoids to alleviate their anaemia. However, despite their use in DBA treatment for more than half a century, the therapeutic mechanisms of glucocorticoids remain largely unknown. Therefore we sought to study disease specific effects of glucocorticoid treatment using a ribosomal protein s19 (Rps19) deficient mouse model of DBA. This study determines for the first time that a mouse model of DBA can respond to glucocorticoid treatment, similar to DBA patients. Our results demonstrate that glucocorticoid treatment reduces apoptosis, rescues erythroid progenitor depletion and premature differentiation of erythroid cells. Furthermore, glucocorticoids prevent Trp53 activation in Rps19-deficient cells- in a disease-specific manner. Dissecting the therapeutic mechanisms behind glucocorticoid treatment of DBA provides indispensible insight into DBA pathogenesis. Identifying mechanisms important for DBA treatment also enables development of more disease-specific treatments of DBA. \\'\"',\n",

To this date, dry eye syndrome in SLE patients is believed to be caused by secondary Sjogren syndrome (sSS). However, there is increasing evidence for possible independency of dry eye syndrome and sSS in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this retrospective observational case series was to identify SLE patients without sSS who had dry eye syndrome, examine the correlation of different autoantibodies and dry eye severity, and determine the cause of dry eye in these patients.We included 49 consecutive SLE patients with dry eye who visited our dry eye clinic. In order to rule out sSS, these patients were all negative for anti-Sjogren\\'s-syndrome-related antigen A and B (anti-SSA/SSB) and had no oral symptoms. Each patient\\'s lupus activity was determined by serological tests including antidouble-stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA), complement levels (C3, C4), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and antinuclear antibody (ANA). Severity of dry eye syndrome was determined by corneal sensation (KSen), superficial punctuate keratopathy (SPK), Schirmer-I test (Schirmer), and tear film break-up time (TBUT). The autoantibodies and the dry eye parameters in each group were tested using the \\\\u03c7 test or the Mann-Whitney U test for normally distributed or skewed data, respectively.The anti-dsDNA showed significant correlations with KSen (P\\\\\\\\u200a<\\\\\\\\u200a0.001), SPK (P\\\\\\\\u200a<\\\\\\\\u200a0.001), and Schirmer (P = 0.042) but not TBUT.

       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by sicca and systemic manifestations. In this Review, we summarize the available data on topical and systemic medications, according to clinical signs and disease activity, and we describe the ongoing studies using biologic drugs in the treatment of pSS. Expanding knowledge about the epidemiology, classification criteria, systemic activity scoring (ESSDAI) and patient-reported outcomes (ESSPRI) is driving active research. Treatment decisions are based on the evaluation of symptoms and extraglandular manifestations. Symptomatic treatment is usually appropriate, whereas systemic treatment is reserved for systemic manifestations. Sicca is managed by education, environment modification, elimination of contingent offending drugs, artificial tears, secretagogues and treatments for complications. Mild systemic signs such as fatigue are treated by exercise. Pain can require short-term moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy and, in some cases, disease-modifying drugs. Severe and acute systemic manifestations indicate treatment with glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressant drugs. The role for biologic agents is promising, but no double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) proving the efficacy of these drugs are available. Targets for new treatments directed against the immunopathological mechanisms of pSS include epithelial cells, T cells, B-cell overactivity, the interferon signature, proinflammatory cytokines, ectopic germinal centre formation, chemokines involved in lymphoid cell homing, and epigenetic modifications.\\'\"',\n",

Several adverse clinical and laboratory predictors have been described. In the current work, we aimed to formulate a predictive score for NHL development, based on clinical, serological, and histopathological findings at the time of SS diagnosis. In the present case-control study of 381 primary SS patients and 92 primary SS patients with concomitant NHL, clinical, serological, and histopathological variables at the time of SS diagnosis were retrospectively recorded. For the identification of predictors for NHL development univariate and multivariate models were constructed. Salivary gland enlargement (SGE), lymphadenopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, anti-Ro/SSA or/and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, monoclonal gammopathy, and C4 hypocomplementemia were shown to be independent predictors for NHL development. On the basis of the number of independent risk factors identified, a predictive risk score for NHL development was formulated. Thus, patients presenting with \\\\u22642 risk factors had a 3.8% probability of NHL development, those with 3 to 6 risk factors 39.9% (OR (95%CI): 16.6 [6.5-42.5], P\\\\\\\\u200a<\\\\\\\\u200a0.05), while in the presence of all 7 risk factors the corresponding probability reached 100% (OR [95%CI]: 210.0 [10.0-4412.9], P\\\\\\\\u200a<\\\\\\\\u200a0.0001). In conclusion, an easy to use diagnostic scoring tool for NHL development in the context of SS is presented.

The most appropriate use of biologics would appear to be in patients with severe or multisystem features of SS, but their use early in the pathogenesis has the potential to prevent disease progression. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha blockade has not proven effective in SS. B-cell depletion using rituximab has been of benefit, mainly in relation to extraglandular features, and to some extent in relation to hyposalivation where there is still residual salivary function. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab is given as a single or periodic intravenous infusion. Potential adverse effects exist, notably infusion reactions and infection, and so a full risk/benefit analysis is indicated for prospective patients. This and clinical use is best performed and monitored in conjunction with rheumatologists with appropriate training and experience in biologic therapies. Further studies of rituximab in SS are ongoing, and newer agents under trial include belimumab. \\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\\\\"By screening for suppressors of the aluminum (Al) hypersensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant als3-1, it was found that mutational loss of the Arabidopsis DNA damage response transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 (SOG1) confers increased Al tolerance similar to the loss-of-function mutants for the cell cycle checkpoint genes ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA AND RAD3 RELATED (ATR) and ALUMINUM TOLERANT2 (ALT2). This suggests that Al-dependent terminal differentiation of the root tip is an active process resulting from activation of the DNA damage checkpoint by an ATR-regulated pathway, which functions at least in part through SOG1. Consistent with this, ATR can phosphorylate SOG1 in vitro. Analysis of SOG1\\'s role in Al-dependent root growth inhibition shows that sog1-7 prevents Al-dependent quiescent center differentiation and endoreduplication in the primary root tip. Following Al exposure, SOG1 increases expression of several genes previously associated with DNA damage, including BRCA1 and PARP2, with gel-shift analysis showing that SOG1 can physically associate with the BRCA1 promoter in vitro. Al-responsive expression of these SOG1-regulated genes requires ATR and ALT2, but not ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED, thus demonstrating that in response to chronic Al exposure, ATR, ALT2, and SOG1 function together to halt root growth and promote terminal differentiation at least in part in a transcription-dependent manner. \\\\\"\"',\n",

Plasma, bile and urine were analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was used to estimate traditional PK parameters. In addition, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model consisting of 11 compartments (6 tissues +5 sample sites) was applied for mechanistic elucidation and estimation of individual PK parameters. FEX had a terminal half-life of 1.7h and a liver extraction of 3%. The fraction of the administered dose of unchanged FEX excreted into the bile was 25% and the bile exposure was more than 100 times higher than the portal vein total plasma exposure, indicating carrier-mediated (CM) disposition processes in the liver. 23% of the administered dose of FEX was excreted unchanged in the urine. An increase in FEX plasma exposure (+50%) and a decrease in renal clearance (-61%) were detected by NCA as a direct effect of concomitant administration of verapamil. However, analysis of the PBPK model also revealed that biliary clearance was significantly inhibited (-53%) by verapamil. In addition, PBPK analysis established that metabolism and CM uptake were important factors in the disposition of FEX in the liver.

In summary, the findings suggest that HCV infection is associated with SS/sicca syndrome. The observed increased risk in studies in which European diagnostic criteria and healthy controls were used and the decreased risk in studies with hospital-based controls may be attributable to selection bias or other unknown factors.\\\\\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The ubiquitin-proteasome system for protein degradation plays a major role in regulating cell function and many signaling proteins are tightly controlled by this mechanism. Among these, Regulator of G Protein Signaling 2 (RGS2) is a target for rapid proteasomal degradation, however, the specific enzymes involved are not known. Using a genomic siRNA screening approach, we identified a novel E3 ligase complex containing cullin 4B (CUL4B), DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and F-box protein 44 (FBXO44) that mediates RGS2 protein degradation. While the more typical F-box partners CUL1 and Skp1 can bind FBXO44, that E3 ligase complex does not bind RGS2 and is not involved in RGS2 degradation. These observations define an unexpected DDB1/CUL4B-containing FBXO44 E3 ligase complex. Pharmacological targeting of this mechanism provides a novel therapeutic approach to hypertension, anxiety, and other diseases associated with RGS2 dysregulation. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Application of information on regional intestinal permeability has been identified as a key aspect of successful pharmaceutical product development. This study presents the results and evaluation of an approach for the indirect estimation of site-specific in vivo intestinal effective permeability (Peff) in humans. Plasma concentration-time profiles from 15 clinical studies that administered drug solutions to specific intestinal regions were collected and analyzed. The intestinal absorption rate for each drug was acquired by deconvolution, using historical intravenous data as reference, and used with the intestinal surface area and the dose remaining in the lumen to estimate the Peff. Forty-three new Peff values were estimated (15 from the proximal small intestine, 11 from the distal small intestine, and 17 from the large intestine) for 14 active pharmaceutical ingredients representing a wide range of biopharmaceutical properties. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.96, slope = 1.24, intercept = 0.030) was established between these indirect jejunal Peff estimates and jejunal Peff measurements determined directly using the single-pass perfusion double balloon technique. On average, Peff estimates from the distal small intestine and large intestine were 90% and 40%, respectively, of those from the proximal small intestine. These results support the use of the evaluated deconvolution method for indirectly estimating regional intestinal Peff in humans. This study presents the first comprehensive data set of estimated human regional intestinal permeability values for a range of drugs. These biopharmaceutical data can be used to improve the accuracy of gastrointestinal absorption predictions used in drug development decision-making. \\'\"',\n",

Warfarin is commonly used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, as well as for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. While reducing risk of thrombotic/embolic incidents, warfarin increases the risk of bleeding. The aim of this study was to elucidate risks of bleeding and thromboembolism for patients on warfarin treatment in a large, unselected cohort with rigorously controlled treatment. This was a retrospective, registry-based study, covering all patients treated with warfarin in the Swedish national anticoagulation register Auricula, which records both primary and specialised care. The study included 77,423 unselected patients with 100,952 treatment periods of warfarin, constituting 217,804 treatment years. Study period was January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2011. Atrial fibrillation was the most common indication (68\\\\\\\\u2009%). The mean time in therapeutic range of the international normalised ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0 was 76.5\\\\\\\\u2009%. The annual incidence of severe bleeding was 2.24\\\\\\\\u2009% and of thromboembolism 2.65\\\\\\\\u2009%. The incidence of intracranial bleeding was 0.37\\\\\\\\u2009% per treatment year in the whole population, and 0.38\\\\\\\\u2009% among patients with atrial fibrillation.

The influence of SS on the clinical outcomes of PBC patients, however, remains unclear.

Of these, the authors excluded patients with diabetes, hypertension, advanced liver cirrhosis at initial diagnosis of PBC (Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification score of \\\\u22657) and other liver diseases (ie, alcoholic liver disease, alpha-antitrypsin deficiency, viral hepatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis), and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of the remaining 125 patients, 77 (61.6%) were PBC-only and 48 (38.4%) were PBC-SS patients.The mean follow-up duration was 8.76 years. During the observation period, the incidence of interstitial lung disease was higher in the PBC-SS group than in the PBC-only group (P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a0.005). The occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was significantly different in PBC-SS patients than in PBC-only patients (P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a0.002). The overall survival was lower in PBC-SS patients than in PBC-only patients (P\\\\\\\\u200a=\\\\\\\\u200a0.033). Although the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, end-stage renal disease, variceal bleeding, and hypothyroidism were all higher in the PBC-SS group than in the PBC-only group, the differences were not significant.Our study suggests that PBC-SS patients have a higher risk of developing interstitial lung disease and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and have a poor prognosis. Aggressive surveillance of thyroid and pulmonary functions should therefore be performed in these patients.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"Impairment of gastrointestinal tract (GI) function, including delayed gastric emptying and colonic dysmotility, are common features of primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome (SS). However, the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of functional autoantibodies to the muscarinic receptor in mediating GI dysfunction associated with primary SS. The effect of SS or normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) on smooth muscle (SM) motility was assessed by comparing the amplitude of carbachol (CCh) or electrical field stimulation (EFS) - induced muscle contraction before and after IgG application. Muscarinic receptor type 3 (M3R) played a dominant role in both colon and gastric SM contraction, while M2R was partly involved in gastric smooth muscle contraction. Preincubation for 1h of the colon and gastric SM strips with 1mg/ml purified IgG from the sera of four primary SS patients (SS IgG) significantly inhibited carbachol-induced smooth muscle contraction (CISC) over a range of CCh concentrations, whereas IgG from healthy controls had little effect. Incubation of the colon SM strips with SS IgG also inhibited EFS-induced colon muscle contraction, which was mimicked by the M3R-selective blocker, 4-DAMP. SR1403330, an NK1 antagonist, had little effect on EFS-mediated colonic SM contraction. The results suggest that autoantibodies isolated from primary SS patients\\' sera inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated cholinergic neurotransmission in mouse colon and stomach, which may provide clues for explaining the GI dysfunction seen in patients with primary SS. \\\\\"\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the exocrine (salivary and lachrymal) glands that results in sicca symptoms (dryness of the eyes and mouth). Systemic complications can occur in pSS, but renal involvement is rare, affecting <10% patients. The most frequent form of nephropathy in pSS is tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), in which infiltration of the kidney by plasma cells is a key feature and shows similarity to the lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the salivary glands. Electrolyte disturbances may occur in pSS, such as renal distal tubular acidosis, diabetes insipidus, Gitelman syndrome or Fanconi syndrome. Glomerular involvement is less frequently detected in patients with pSS, but usually takes the form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis secondary to cryoglobulinaemia. The renal prognosis in patients with pSS and TIN or glomerular disease is usually favourable, but the risk of chronic kidney disease remains high in patients with TIN. Appropriate screening must be performed at least once a year in patients with systemic pSS in order to facilitate the early detection of renal complications. In this Review we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and treatment of renal disease in pSS. \\'\"',\n",

Based on a time-course analysis, we identified 44 miRNAs with altered expression [false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%, fold change > \\\\u00b11.2] during differentiation, including the marked upregulation of the canonical myogenic miRNAs miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206. Microarray profiling of mRNA expression at day 0, 4, and 10 identified 842 and 949 genes differentially expressed (FDR < 10%) at day 4 and 10, respectively. At day 10, 42% of altered transcripts demonstrated reciprocal expression patterns in relation to the directional change of their in silico predicted regulatory miRNAs based on analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis microRNA Target Filter. Bioinformatic analysis predicted networks of regulation during differentiation including myomiRs miR-1/206 and miR-133a/b, miRNAs previously established in differentiation including miR-26 and miR-30, and novel miRNAs regulated during differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells such as miR-138-5p and miR-20a.

       " '\"\\'The current 2002 classification criteria do not cover the broad clinical and immunological heterogeneity of primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SS), since five of the six criteria focus exclusively on glandular involvement and the remaining criterion is the mandatory presence of anti-Ro/La antibodies. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features of patients with a well-established diagnosis of primary SS who do not fulfill the 2002 classification criteria. Five hundred seven patients diagnosed with primary SS (1993 criteria) were consecutively included and followed up. Two hundred twenty-one (44%) patients did not fulfill the 2002 criteria. These patients were older at diagnosis (p < 0.001) and had a lower frequency of parotid enlargement (p = 0.002), fever (p = 0.041), arthritis (p = 0.041), vasculitis (p = 0.050), peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.002), cranial nerve involvement (p = 0.015), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) levels (p < 0.001), anemia (p < 0.001), leukopenia (p = 0.037), hypergammaglobulinemia (p < 0.001), positive rheumatoid factor ( RF; p = 0.002), and cryoglobulinemia (p = 0.049) in comparison with those fulfilling 2002 criteria. However, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of sicca features, diagnostic tests, overall systemic involvement, antinuclear antibodies , complement levels, development of B-cell lymphoma, or survival. Patients with anti-Ro antibodies had the highest frequencies of systemic features, hematological abnormalities, and altered immunological markers. In conclusion, patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria, who have either a specific histological diagnosis (lymphocytic infiltration) or highly specific autoantibodies (Ro/La), might well be considered to have Sj\\\\u00f6gren \\\\\"disease.\\\\\" In contrast, etiopathogenic mechanisms other than lymphocytic-mediated epithelial damage could be involved in patients with negative Ro and negative biopsy, in whom the term Sj\\\\u00f6gren \\\\\"syndrome\\\\\" seems more adequate.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\\\\"Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by dry eye and dry mouth. We systematically reviewed all the randomized controlled clinical trials published in the last 15\\\\\\\\xa0years that included ocular outcomes. We found 22 trials involving 9 topical, 10 oral, 2 intravenous and 1 subcutaneous modalities of treatment. Fluoromethalone eye drops over 8\\\\\\\\xa0weeks were more effective than topical cyclosporine in the treatment of dry eye symptoms and signs; similarly, indomethacin eye drops over 1\\\\\\\\xa0month were more efficacious than diclofenac eye drops. Oral pilocarpine 5\\\\\\\\xa0mg twice daily over 3\\\\\\\\xa0months was superior to use of lubricants or punctal plugs for treating dry eye, but 5% of participants had gastrointestinal adverse effects from pilocarpine, though none discontinued treatment. In contrast, etanercept, a TNF-alpha blocking antibody, administered as subcutaneous injections twice weekly, did not improve dry eye significantly compared to placebo injections. In conclusion, topical corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in dry eye associated with Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome. As some topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be more effective than others, these should be further evaluated. Systemic secretagogues like pilocarpine have a role in Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome but the adverse effects may limit their clinical use. It is disappointing that systemic cytokine therapy did not produce encouraging ocular outcomes but participants should have assessment of cytokine levels in such trials, as those with higher baseline cytokine levels may respond better.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity and mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid. More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects and complex nucleotide changes. We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous gene deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus on 17p11.2. The deletions were defined using long distance inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 24-year-old SLS female was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes including ALDH3A1, which codes for the major soluble protein in cornea. Although lacking corneal disease, she showed severe symptoms of SLS with uncommon deterioration in oral motor function and loss of ambulation. The other 19-month-old female patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44-Mb contiguous gene deletion and a missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2. These studies suggest that large gene deletions may account for up to 5% of the mutant alleles in SLS. Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.\\'\"',\n",

Using high-resolution ChIP-sequencing, we show that the localization of budding yeast Smc5/6 to duplicated chromosomes indeed depends on sister chromatid cohesion in wild-type and top2-4 cells. Smc5/6 is found to be enriched at cohesin binding sites in the centromere-proximal regions in both cell types, but also along chromosome arms when replication has occurred under Top2-inhibiting conditions. Reactivation of Top2 after replication causes Smc5/6 to dissociate from chromosome arms, supporting the assumption that Smc5/6 associates with a Top2 substrate. It is also demonstrated that the amount of Smc5/6 on chromosomes positively correlates with the level of missegregation in top2-4, and that Smc5/6 promotes segregation of short chromosomes in the mutant. Altogether, this shows that the chromosomal localization of Smc5/6 predicts the presence of the chromatid segregation-inhibiting entities which accumulate in top2-4 mutated cells. These are most likely SCIs, and our results thus indicate that, at least when Top2 is inhibited, Smc5/6 facilitates their resolution. \\'\"',\n",

MSGs IL-22R1-expressing cells were characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in pSS, nSCS and healthy controls . The effect of recombinant IL-18 and IL-22 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pSS and nSCS was studied by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MSGs of pSS and NHL were characterized by an imbalance between IL-22 and IL-22BP protein expression, with IL-18 and IL-22BP being expressed in a mutually exclusive manner and IL-18 and IL-22R1 being correlated directly. Aberrant expression of IL-22R1, induced by IL-18, was observed only among tissue and circulating myeloid cells of pSS patients and macrophages of NHL tissues of pSS patients, but not nSCS. IL-22R1 expression on PBMC of pSS was functional, as its stimulation with recombinant IL-22 significantly up-regulated the expression of STAT-3, IL-17 and IL-22.

       " '\"\\'The local distribution of 2-hydroxyflutamide (2-HOF) in prostate tissue after a single intraprostatic injection of a novel parenteral modified-release (MR) formulation in patients with localized prostate cancer was estimated using a semiphysiologically based biopharmaceutical model. Plasma concentration-time profiles for 2-HOF were acquired from a phase II study in 24 patients and the dissolution of the MR formulation was investigated in vitro. Human physiological values and the specific physicochemical properties of 2-HOF were obtained from the literature or calculated via established algorithms. A compartmental modeling approach was adopted for tissue and blood in the prostate gland, where the compartments were modeled as a series of concentric spherical shells contouring the centrally positioned depot formulation. Discrete fluid connections between the blood compartments were described by the representative flow of blood, whereas the mass transport of drug from tissue to tissue and tissue to blood was described by a one-dimensional diffusion approximation. An empirical dissolution approach was adopted for the release of 2-HOF from the formulation. The model adequately described the plasma concentration-time profiles of 2-HOF. Predictive simulations indicated that the local tissue concentration of 2-HOF within a distance of 5 mm from the depot formulation was approximately 40 times higher than that of unbound 2-HOF in plasma. The simulations also indicated that spreading the formulation throughout the prostate gland would expose more of the gland and increase the overall release rate of 2-HOF from the given dose. The increased release rate would initially increase the tissue and plasma concentrations but would also reduce the terminal half-life of 2-HOF in plasma. Finally, an in vitro-in vivo correlation of the release of 2-HOF from the parenteral MR formulation was established. This study shows that intraprostatic 2-HOF concentrations are significantly higher than systemic plasma concentrations and that increased distribution of 2-HOF throughout the gland, using strategic imaging-guided administration, is possible. This novel parenteral MR formulation, thus, facilitates good pharmacological effect while minimizing the risk of side effects. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Biochemical high-throughput screening is widely used in drug discovery, using a variety of small molecule libraries. However, broader screening strategies may be more beneficial to identify novel biologic mechanisms. In the current study we used a \\\\u03b2-galactosidase complementation method to screen a selection of microbial-derived pre-fractionated natural product extracts for those that increase regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) protein levels. RGS2 is a member of a large family of proteins that all regulate signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by accelerating GTPase activity on active G\\\\u03b1 as well as through other mechanisms. RGS2(-/-) mice are hypertensive, show increased anxiety, and are prone to heart failure. RGS2 has a very short protein half-life due to rapid proteasomal degradation, and we propose that enhancement of RGS2 protein levels could be a beneficial therapeutic strategy. Bioassay-guided fractionation of one of the hit strains yielded a pure compound, Indolactam V, a known protein kinase C (PKC) activator, which selectively increased RGS2 protein levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as well as activation of the Gq-coupled muscarinic M3 receptor. The effect on RGS2 protein levels was blocked by the nonselective PKC inhibitor G\\\\u00f66983 (3-[1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), the PKC\\\\u03b2-selective inhibitor Ruboxastaurin, as well as small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PKC\\\\u03b2. Indolactam V-mediated increases in RGS2 protein levels also had functional effects on GPCR signaling.

However, little is known about mechanisms of compound toxicity in hiPSC-Hep. In this study, modified mRNA was used to reprogram foreskin fibroblasts into hiPSC that were differentiated into hiPSC-Hep. The hiPSC-Hep expressed characteristic hepatic proteins and exhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities. Next, the hiPSC-Hep, primary cryopreserved human hepatocytes (cryo-hHep) and the hepatic cell lines HepaRG and Huh7 were treated with staurosporine and acetaminophen, and the toxic responses were compared. In addition, the expression of genes regulating and executing apoptosis was analyzed in the different cell types. Staurosporine, an inducer of apoptosis, decreased ATP levels and activated caspases 3 and 7 in all cell types, but to less extent in Huh7. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering and a principal component analysis (PCA) of the expression of apoptosis-associated genes separated cryo-hHep from the other cell types, while an enrichment analysis of apoptotic pathways identified hiPSC-Hep as more similar to cryo-hHep than the hepatic cell lines. Finally, acetaminophen induced apoptosis in hiPSC-Hep, HepaRG and Huh7, while the compound initiated a direct necrotic response in cryo-hHep. Our results indicate that for studying compounds initiating apoptosis directly hiPSC-Hep may be a good alternative to cryo-hHep. Furthermore, for compounds with more complex mechanisms of toxicity involving metabolic activation, such as acetaminophen, our data suggest that the cause of cell death depends on a balance between factors controlling death signals and the drug-metabolizing capacity.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Mechanisms underlying motor neuron subtype-selective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and associated axonal pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unclear. Here we show that the molecular environment of the ER between motor neuron subtypes is distinct, with characteristic signatures. We identify cochaperone SIL1, mutated in Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS), as being robustly expressed in disease-resistant slow motor neurons but not in ER stress-prone fast-fatigable motor neurons. In a mouse model of MSS, we demonstrate impaired ER homeostasis in motor neurons in response to loss of SIL1 function. Loss of a single functional Sil1 allele in an ALS mouse model (SOD1-G93A) enhanced ER stress and exacerbated ALS pathology. In SOD1-G93A mice, SIL1 levels were progressively and selectively reduced in vulnerable fast-fatigable motor neurons. Mechanistically, reduction in SIL1 levels was associated with lowered excitability of fast-fatigable motor neurons, further influencing expression of specific ER chaperones. Adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of SIL1 to familial ALS motor neurons restored ER homeostasis, delayed muscle denervation and prolonged survival. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a pivotal regulator of inflammation and cell death. An integral component of ER stress-induced apoptosis is expression of growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153). Further, ER stress response is implicated in leukocyte adhesion and recent studies have discovered endogenous inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion including the developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1). Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome (SS) is associated with increased salivary gland expression of GADD153 and increased leukocyte infiltration in association with decreased Del-1 thereby contributing to inflammation and cell death. We utilized the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of SS-like disease, in association with immunostaining and flow cytometry-based studies. Salivary glands of 14-week-old NOD mice displayed a) increased GADD153 expression, b) marked reduction in Del-1, c) inflammatory cell infiltrates including CD3+ T and CD19+ B lymphocytes as well as M1 and M2 macrophages and d) increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-17 but reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. These changes were accompanied with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and significant increase in apoptosis and necrosis of salivary gland cells of NOD than control mice. Our collective observations suggested that GADD153 directly and/or indirectly through downregulation of Del-1 contributes importantly to salivary gland inflammation and cell death. To establish the relevance of GADD153 and Del-1 for the human condition, lower lip biopsy samples of non-SS subjects and those with a diagnosis of SS were subjected to immunohistochemistry. The results show intense GADD153 immunostaining but marked reduction in Del-1 expression in biopsy samples of SS compared to non-SS subjects. Collectively, the results indicate that GADD153 regulates inflammation and cell death in salivary gland in SS. Further, Del-1 expression likely provides a mechanistic link between increased GADD153 and leukocyte infiltration and accompanying inflammation of salivary gland tissue in this condition. \\\\\"\"',\n",

Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome has been associated with small cyst formation in salivary glands, thymus, and lungs and has been recently brought to the forefront by radiologists due to high-resolution techniques. However, pathologists are less aware of this finding unless clinico-radiologic-pathologic correlation is sought. Formation of large bullae in SS is a rare complication with potential for confusion with other diseases. Here, we present the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in 3 patients with SS associated with multiple pulmonary cystic lesions. All 3 patients had a variable mixed restrictive and obstructive component of the disease. There was good correlation with the pulmonary function tests (PFTs), high-resolution computed tomographic scan, and morphology with regard to the restrictive component. The small cysts appear to correlate with the extent of obstructive changes on the PFTs. However, the large bullae do not, implying noncommunication with the conducting airways. This noncorrelation between the PFTs and extent of bullous disease with predominant involvement of lower lobes in SS enables distinction from bullous emphysema. The mechanism of bulla formation in SS appears to be different from bullous emphysema. A check valve mechanism has been proposed previously in SS, which does not explain cyst formation in the thymus. Alternately, inflammation may play a role with the key suspects being CD4 T-helper cells and perhaps NK cells.

ClpC has long been held to act both independently and as the regulatory partner for the ATP-dependent Clp protease, and yet this and many other important characteristics remain unclear. In this study, we reveal that of the two near-identical ClpC paralogs (ClpC1 and ClpC2) in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, along with the closely related ClpD, it is ClpC1 that is the most abundant throughout leaf maturation. An unexpectedly large proportion of both chloroplast ClpC proteins (30% of total ClpC content) associates to envelope membranes in addition to their stromal localization. The Clp proteolytic core is also bound to envelope membranes, the amount of which is sufficient to bind to all the similarly localized ClpC. The role of such an envelope membrane Clp protease remains unclear although it appears uninvolved in preprotein processing or Tic subunit protein turnover. Within the stroma, the amount of oligomeric ClpC protein is less than that of the Clp proteolytic core, suggesting most if not all stromal ClpC functions as part of the Clp protease; a proposal supported by the near abolition of Clp degradation activity in the clpC1 knock-out mutant. Overall, ClpC appears to function primarily within the Clp protease, as the principle stromal protease responsible for maintaining homeostasis, and also on the envelope membrane where it possibly confers a novel protein quality control mechanism for chloroplast preprotein import. \\'\"',\n",

The structure reveals three well-defined active site cavities within the membrane-spanning region in each monomer interface of the trimeric structure. An important determinant of the active site cavity is a small cytosolic domain inserted between transmembrane helices I and II. This extra domain is not observed in other structures of proteins within the MAPEG (Membrane-Associated Proteins involved in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism) superfamily but is likely to be present also in microsomal GST-1 based on sequence similarity.

Bortezomib administration resulted in a notable improvement of the general symptoms, particularly fatigue, and a decrease in serum globulin levels as well as in serum viscosity. Hyperglobulinemic purpura disappeared, and prednisone tapering succeeded. Because of chronicity, no clinical changes were observed in sicca symptoms.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). FALDH is an enzyme component of fatty alcohol:NAD oxidoreductase (FAO), which is necessary for fatty alcohol metabolism. To better understand the biochemical basis for the cutaneous symptoms in this disease, we investigated lipid metabolism in cultured keratinocytes from SLS patients. Enzyme activities of FALDH and FAO in SLS cells were <10% of normal. SLS keratinocytes accumulated 45-fold more fatty alcohol (hexadecanol, octadecanol, and octadecenol) than normal, whereas wax esters and 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerols were increased by 5.6-fold and 7.5-fold, respectively. SLS keratinocytes showed a reduced incorporation of radioactive octadecanol into fatty acid (24% of normal) and triglyceride (13% of normal), but incorporation into wax esters and 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol was increased by 2.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. Our results indicate that FALDH deficiency in SLS keratinocytes causes the accumulation and diversion of fatty alcohol into alternative biosynthetic pathways. The striking lipid abnormalities in cultured SLS keratinocytes are distinct from those seen in fibroblasts and may be related to the stratum corneum dysfunction and ichthyosis in SLS.\\'\"',\n",

Probiotic bacteria are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host and can alter the composition of the GM. Germ-free mice have increased bone mass associated with reduced bone resorption indicating that the GM also regulates bone mass. Ovariectomy (ovx) results in bone loss associated with altered immune status. The purpose of this study was to determine if probiotic treatment protects mice from ovx-induced bone loss. Mice were treated with either a single Lactobacillus (L) strain, L. paracasei DSM13434 (L. para) or a mixture of three strains, L. paracasei DSM13434, L. plantarum DSM 15312 and DSM 15313 (L. mix) given in the drinking water during 6 weeks, starting two weeks before ovx. Both the L. para and the L. mix treatment protected mice from ovx-induced cortical bone loss and bone resorption. Cortical bone mineral content was higher in both L. para and L. mix treated ovx mice compared to vehicle (veh) treated ovx mice. Serum levels of the resorption marker C-terminal telopeptides and the urinary fractional excretion of calcium were increased by ovx in the veh treated but not in the L. para or the L. mix treated mice. Probiotic treatment reduced the expression of the two inflammatory cytokines, TNF\\\\u03b1 and IL-1\\\\u03b2, and increased the expression of OPG, a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, in cortical bone of ovx mice. In addition, ovx decreased the frequency of regulatory T cells in bone marrow of veh treated but not probiotic treated mice. In conclusion, treatment with L. para or the L. mix prevents ovx-induced cortical bone loss. Our findings indicate that these probiotic treatments alter the immune status in bone resulting in attenuated bone resorption in ovx mice. \\'\"',\n",

A depletion method previously shown to provide reliable results, the multiple depletion curves method (MDCM), was used as reference. Experiments were conducted with human liver microsomes, and samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CL(int) estimated with the ODA were in >90% of the cases within a 2-fold difference compared with MDCM estimates. In addition, good agreement was generally seen for V(max) and K(m) estimates between the two methods as >80% of the estimates were within or almost within a 2-fold difference. The variability in V(max) and K(m) estimates were generally higher than for CL(int) estimates. In addition, decreased substrate turnover considerably increased the variability in V(max) and K(m) estimates, whereas only a modest increase was observed for CL(int) estimates. The experimental design of using multiple starting concentrations for the estimation of enzyme kinetics was shown to be appropriate even when there was a limitation to the number of samples. The method allowed for good estimates of CL(int) and also for V(max) and K(m) in many cases. Hence, this approach is a good alternative for the estimation of enzyme kinetic parameters, especially if enzyme saturation and an assessment of a potential risk for nonlinear metabolism are of interest.\\\\\"\"',\n",

Streptococcus pyogenes [GAS (group A Streptococcus)] secretes the enzyme EndoS that cleaves glycans on human IgG and impairs the effector functions of the antibody. The ndoS gene, encoding EndoS, has, until now, been thought to be conserved throughout the serotypes. However, in the present study, we identify EndoS2, an endoglycosidase in serotype M49 GAS strains. We characterized EndoS2 and the corresponding ndoS2 gene using sequencing, bioinformatics, phylogenetic analysis, recombinant expression and LC-MS analysis of glycosidic activity. This revealed that EndoS2 is present exclusively, and highly conserved, in serotype M49 of GAS and is only 37% identical with EndoS. EndoS2 showed endo-\\\\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity on all N-linked glycans of IgG and on biantennary and sialylated glycans of AGP (\\\\u03b11-acid glycoprotein). The enzyme was found to act only on native IgG and AGP and to be specific for free biantennary glycans with or without terminal sialylation. GAS M49 expression of EndoS2 was monitored in relation to carbohydrates present in the culture medium and was linked to the presence of sucrose. We conclude that EndoS2 is a unique endoglycosidase in serotype M49 and differs from EndoS of other GAS strains by targeting both IgG and AGP. EndoS2 expands the repertoire of GAS effectors that modify key glycosylated molecules of host defence. \\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Meiosis is a specialized cell division used by diploid organisms to form haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Central to this reductive division is repair of endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the meiosis-specific enzyme Spo11. These DSBs are repaired in a process called homologous recombination using the sister chromatid or the homologous chromosome as a repair template, with the homolog being the preferred substrate during meiosis. Specific products of inter-homolog recombination, called crossovers, are essential for proper homolog segregation at the first meiotic nuclear division in budding yeast and mice. This study identifies an essential role for the conserved Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) 5/6 protein complex during meiotic recombination in budding yeast. Meiosis-specific smc5/6 mutants experience a block in DNA segregation without hindering meiotic progression. Establishment and removal of meiotic sister chromatid cohesin are independent of functional Smc6 protein. smc6 mutants also have normal levels of DSB formation and repair. Eliminating DSBs rescues the segregation block in smc5/6 mutants, suggesting that the complex has a function during meiotic recombination. Accordingly, smc6 mutants accumulate high levels of recombination intermediates in the form of joint molecules. Many of these joint molecules are formed between sister chromatids, which is not normally observed in wild-type cells. The normal formation of crossovers in smc6 mutants supports the notion that mainly inter-sister joint molecule resolution is impaired. In addition, return-to-function studies indicate that the Smc5/6 complex performs its most important functions during joint molecule resolution without influencing crossover formation.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome is an autosomal-recessive hereditary disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. It is known that mutations in the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) gene (ALDH3A2) underlie SLS. We report two Indian sisters showing typical clinical features of SLS. Direct sequencing of the entire coding region of ALDH3A2 revealed a novel homozygous mutation, c.142G>T (p.Asp48Tyr) in exon 1, in both patients. Their parents harbored the mutation heterozygously. Mutant-allele-specific amplification analysis using PCR products as a template verified the mutation in the patients. The aspartic acid residue at the mutation site is located in the C-terminal portion of the second a-helix strand, a2, of N-terminal four helices of FALDH and the FALDH amino-acid sequence alignment shows that this aspartic acid residue is conserved among several diverse species. Until now, a number of mutations in ALDH3A2 have been shown to be responsible for SLS in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North and South America. However, in Asian populations, ALDH3A2 mutations have been identified only in Japanese SLS patients. Here we report an ALDH3A2 mutation for the first time in SLS patients in the Asian country other than Japan. The present results suggest that ALDH3A2 is a gene responsible for SLS in Asian populations. We hope ALDH3A2 mutation search will be globally available including many Asian countries in the future.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The diagnosis and treatment of patients with Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SS) with neuropathic pain pose several challenges. Patients with SS may experience unorthodox patterns of burning pain not conforming to a traditional \\\\\"stocking-and-glove\\\\\" distribution, which can affect the face, torso, and proximal extremities. This distribution of neuropathic pain may reflect mechanisms targeting the proximal-most element of the peripheral nervous system-the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Skin biopsy can diagnose such a small-fiber neuropathy and is a surrogate marker of DRG neuronal cell loss. However, SS patients have been reported who have similar patterns of proximal neuropathic pain, despite having normal skin biopsy studies. In such cases, DRGs may be targeted by mechanisms not associated with neuronal cell loss. Therefore, alternative approaches are warranted to help characterize abnormal DRGs in SS patients with proximal neuropathic pain.We performed a systematic review of the literature to define the frequency and spectrum of SS peripheral neuropathies, and to better understand the attribution of SS neuropathic pain to peripheral neuropathies. We found that the frequency of SS neuropathic pain exceeded the prevalence of peripheral neuropathies, and that painful peripheral neuropathies occurred less frequently than neuropathies not always associated with pain. We developed a novel magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) protocol to evaluate DRG abnormalities. Ten SS patients with proximal neuropathic pain were evaluated by this MRN protocol, as well as by punch skin biopsies evaluating for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) of unmyelinated nerves. Five patients had radiographic evidence of DRG abnormalities. Patients with MRN DRG abnormalities had increased IENFD of unmyelinated nerves compared to patients without MRN DRG abnormalities (30.2 [interquartile range, 4.4] fibers/mm vs. 11.0 [4.1] fibers/mm, respectively; p = 0.03). Two of these 5 SS patients whose neuropathic pain resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy had improvement of MRN DRG abnormalities.We have developed a novel MRN protocol that can detect DRG abnormalities in SS patients with neuropathic pain who do not have markers of peripheral neuropathy. We found that SS patients with MRN DRG abnormalities had statistically significant, increased IENFD on skin biopsy studies, which may suggest a relationship between trophic mediators and neuropathic pain. Given that our literature review has demonstrated that many SS neuropathic pain patients do not have a neuropathy, our findings suggest an important niche for this MRN DRG technique in the evaluation of broader subsets of SS neuropathic pain patients who may not have underlying neuropathies. The improvement of MRN DRG abnormalities in patients with IVIg-induced remission of neuropathic pain suggests that our MRN protocol may be capturing reversible, immune-mediated mechanisms targeting the DRG.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS) features cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, cataracts, and progressive vacuolar myopathy with peculiar myonuclear alterations. Most MSS patients carry homozygous or compound heterozygous SIL1 mutations. SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor for the endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone BiP which controls a plethora of essential processes in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study we made use of the spontaneous Sil1 mouse mutant woozy to explore pathomechanisms leading to Sil1 deficiency-related skeletal muscle pathology. We found severe, progressive myopathy characterized by alterations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, mitochondrial changes, and prominent myonuclear pathology including nuclear envelope and nuclear lamina alterations. These abnormalities were remarkably similar to the myopathy in human patients with MSS. In particular, the presence of perinuclear membranous structures which have been reported as an ultrastructural hallmark of MSS-related myopathy could be confirmed in woozy muscles. We found that these structures are derived from the nuclear envelope and nuclear lamina and associate with proliferations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In line with impaired function of BiP secondary to loss of its nucleotide exchange factor Sil1, we observed activation of the unfolded protein response and the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation-pathway. Despite initiation of the autophagy-lysosomal system, autophagic clearance was found ineffective which is in agreement with the formation of autophagic vacuoles. This report identifies woozy muscle as a faithful phenocopy of the MSS myopathy. Moreover, we provide a link between two well-established disease mechanisms in skeletal muscle, dysfunction of chaperones and nuclear envelope pathology.\\'\"',\n",

Further understanding and improvement of gastrointestinal drug absorption predictions is currently a highly prioritized area of research within the pharmaceutical industry. The fraction absorbed (fabs) of an oral dose after administration of a solid dosage form is a key parameter in the estimation of the in vivo performance of an orally administrated drug formulation. This study discloses an evaluation of the predictive performance of the mechanistic physiologically based absorption model GI-Sim. GI-Sim deploys a compartmental gastrointestinal absorption and transit model as well as algorithms describing permeability, dissolution rate, salt effects, partitioning into micelles, particle and micelle drifting in the aqueous boundary layer, particle growth and amorphous or crystalline precipitation. Twelve APIs with reported or expected absorption limitations in humans, due to permeability, dissolution and/or solubility, were investigated. Predictions of the intestinal absorption for different doses and formulations were performed based on physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties, such as solubility in buffer and simulated intestinal fluid, molecular weight, pK(a), diffusivity and molecule density, measured or estimated human effective permeability and particle size distribution. The performance of GI-Sim was evaluated by comparing predicted plasma concentration-time profiles along with oral pharmacokinetic parameters originating from clinical studies in healthy individuals. The capability of GI-Sim to correctly predict impact of dose and particle size as well as the in vivo performance of nanoformulations was also investigated. The overall predictive performance of GI-Sim was good as >95% of the predicted pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max) and AUC) were within a 2-fold deviation from the clinical observations and the predicted plasma AUC was within one standard deviation of the observed mean plasma AUC in 74% of the simulations. GI-Sim was also able to correctly capture the trends in dose- and particle size dependent absorption for the study drugs with solubility and dissolution limited absorption, respectively. In addition, GI-Sim was also shown to be able to predict the increase in absorption and plasma exposure achieved with nanoformulations. Based on the results, the performance of GI-Sim was shown to be suitable for early risk assessment as well as to guide decision making in pharmaceutical formulation development.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"Plants are ideal for the production of protein-based nanomaterials because they synthesize and assemble complex multimeric proteins that cannot be expressed efficiently using other platforms. Plant viruses can be thought of as self-replicating proteinaceous nanomaterials generally stable and easily produced in high titers. We used Potato virus X (PVX), chimeric virus particles, and Cowpea mosaic virus, empty virus-like particles to display a linear peptide (lipo) derived from human lipocalin, which is immunodominant in Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome (SjS) and is thus recognized by autoantibodies in SjS patient serum. These virus-derived nanoparticles were thus used to develop a diagnostic assay for SjS based on a direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay format. We found that PVX-lipo formulations were more sensitive than the chemically synthesized immunodominant peptide and equally specific when used to distinguish between healthy individuals and SjS patients. Our novel assay therefore allows the diagnosis of SjS using a simple, low-invasive serum test, contrasting with the invasive labial biopsy required for current tests. Our results demonstrate that nanomaterials based on plant viruses can be used as diagnostic reagents for SjS, and could also be developed for the diagnosis of other diseases. \\\\\"\"',\n",

RESULTS The plasma P-selectin autoantibodies (A490) in ITP patients and pSS patients with/without thrombocytopenia were significantly higher than those in healthy controls, but there were no significant differences between ITP patients and pSS patients with thrombocytopenia. The positive rate of P-selectin autoantibodies in pSS patients with thrombocytopenia was significantly higher than that in ITP patients. The platelet count was lower in P-selectin autoantibodies-positive patients, while among pSS patients with thrombocytopenia, the platelet count was lower in P-selectin autoantibodies-positive patients than in P-selectin autoantibodies-negative patients.

Differential conditions should be considered, especially the ones that promote xerostomia, such as diabetes, ectodermal dysplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, HIV and HTLV infection. Conditions associated with parotid enlargement should also be excluded, including juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP), sialadenosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, infectious parotitis caused by streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, viral infections (paramyxovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus), and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (associated with HIV infection), and rare congenital conditions, such as polycystic parotid disease. CASE REPORT. A paediatric female patient was referred to our clinic for dental treatment complaining about dry mouth, oral discomfort, and dysphagia. The patient presented five of the required criteria to establish the diagnosis of pSS, including ocular symptoms, oral symptoms, evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, focal sialadenitis confirmed by minor salivary gland biopsy, and evidence of major salivary gland involvement. Our patient did not have positive SS-A and SS-B autoantibodies. According to the literature, about 29% of individuals with pSS can present seronegativity for SS-A (anti-Ro) antibodies and about 33% can present seronegativity for SS-B (anti-La) antibodies. CONCLUSION. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported in the scientific English literature with pSS. Primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome has a wide clinical and immunologic spectrum and may progress with increased morbidity. Clinicians must be aware of the development of pSS in such an early age and exclude all possible differential findings to provide early diagnosis and treatment.\\'\"',\n",

Forty consecutive pSS patients with SFN were included. SFN was defined by the presence of suggestive sensory painful symptoms with normal nerve conduction studies and abnormal neurophysiologic tests for small nerve fibers or a low intraepidermal nerve fiber density at skin biopsy. Included patients were compared to 100 pSS patients without peripheral neuropathy.SFN patients were mainly female (92.5%).

Clinical symptoms included burning pains (90%), numbness (87.5%), tingling (82.5%), pins and needles (72.5%), electric discharges (70%), and allodynia (55%). Dysautonomia included vasomotor symptoms (66%) and hyperhidrosis (47%). Abnormal neurophysiologic tests included laser evoked potentials (97.5%), thermal quantitative sensory testing (67.5%), and sympathetic skin reflex (40%).

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed normal levels of choline, creatine and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and the characteristic lipid signals in the white matter brain tissue. Conventional MRI showed increased signal intensity around the lateral ventricles indicating abnormal myelination. DTI revealed normal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, but reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter. After co-registration of the parameters obtained with DTI with the results of MRS (36 voxels), significant correlations were obtained of lipid content with FA (r=0.81), ADC (r=-0.62), choline (r=0.51), and NAA (r=0.44) (P<0.01, all). These results suggest that in Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome, the white matter lipid signals originate from the neurons, with NAA and choline reflecting neuron density and myelination. The comparatively high FA/low ADC values in these lipid-rich locations, indicate a loss of diffusion in directions perpendicular to the fibers.

Contributing causes for nonresponse to the vaccine are genetic predisposition, immunosuppression, and certain chronic illnesses. The distinction between true nonresponse (after adequate immunization) and waning anti-HBs levels is important. The latter is not uncommon in populations in areas of the world with low endemicity for HBV infection. Data from subjects with waning anti-HBs levels show that immunologic memory may still protect these individuals against acute HBV infection or may prevent chronic infection with HBV for < or =10 years after immunization. Recent reports from Asia and Alaska describe cases of chronic HBV infection 15 years after immunization in subjects who have very low levels of anti-HBs. Thus, nonresponders or those with waning immunity who may be at risk of HBV infection in subsequent years may require a booster dose.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an inherited neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid.

More than 70 mutations in ALDH3A2 have been discovered in SLS patients including amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions and splicing errors. Most mutations are private, but several common mutations reflect founder effects, consanguinity or recurrent mutational events. FALDH oxidizes fatty aldehyde substrates arising from metabolism of fatty alcohols, leukotriene B4, ether glycerolipids and other potential sources such as sphingolipids. The pathogenesis of the cutaneous and neurologic symptoms is thought to result from abnormal lipid accumulation in the membranes of skin and brain; the formation of aldehyde Schiff base adducts with amine-containing lipids or proteins; or defective eicosanoid metabolism. Therapeutic approaches are being developed to target specific metabolic defects associated with FALDH deficiency or to correct the genetic defect by gene transfer.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2), a G(q)-specific GTPase-activating protein, is strongly implicated in cardiovascular function. RGS2(-/-) mice are hypertensive and prone to heart failure, and several rare human mutations that accelerate RGS2 degradation have been identified among patients with hypertension. Therefore, pharmacological up-regulation of RGS2 protein levels might be beneficial. We used a \\\\u03b2-galactosidase complementation method to screen several thousand compounds with known pharmacological functions for those that increased RGS2 protein levels. Several cardiotonic steroids (CTSs), including ouabain and digoxin, increased RGS2 but not RGS4 protein levels. CTSs increased RGS2 protein levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism, by slowing protein degradation. RGS2 mRNA levels in primary vascular smooth muscle cells were unaffected by CTS treatment, whereas protein levels were increased 2- to 3-fold. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase was required for the increase in RGS2 protein levels, because the effect was lost in Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CTS-induced increases in RGS2 levels were functional and reduced receptor-stimulated, G(q)-dependent, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, we showed that in vivo treatment with digoxin led to increased RGS2 protein levels in heart and kidney. CTS-induced increases in RGS2 protein levels and function might modify several deleterious mechanisms in hypertension and heart failure. This novel CTS mechanism might contribute to the beneficial actions of low-dose digoxin treatment in heart failure. Our results support the concept of small-molecule modulation of RGS2 protein levels as a new strategy for cardiovascular therapy.\\'\"',\n",

Nine female and eight male patients with SLS (age range 1-35y) were investigated. Data were obtained by structured interview with parents and patients with SLS, a telephone-conducted questionnaire, and physical examination. Motor performance was measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure; everyday functioning was assessed using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. In most patients, spasticity was bilaterally present in hamstrings, hip adductors, and gastrocnemic muscles. All participants above 7 years had contractures in the lower extremities. Limitations were present in all gross motor dimensions, except for lying and rolling. Participants had developmental ages far below their chronological age. This study revealed that patients with SLS have limitations in gross motor performance.

Head MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging) showed high signal intensities in the right thalamus and the cerebral cortices in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes (predominantly on the right side). An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed periodic lateralized epileptic discharges (PLEDs). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed high total tau protein and 14-3-3 protein levels. This case was diagnosed as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) based on these clinical data. However, the patient gradually improved without specific treatment. The differential diagnosis was reconsidered, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive serum anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies were noted. A diagnosis of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SjS) was finally made based on a biopsy of a minor salivary gland showing infiltration of lymphocytes around the gland ducts. Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40mg/day orally) was given, and his clinical condition improved. The lesions on the head MRI decreased, and the EEG findings normalized.

Conjunctival impression cytology specimens were collected from normal control subjects and Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome patients for Real-time PCR, PAS staining, and immunohistochemistry assays. In addition, conjunctiva biopsy specimens from both groups were examined for the expression differences of MUC19 and MUC5AC at both mRNA and protein level.

The immunohistochemical staining of mucins showed that MUC19 was expressed in epithelial cells from corneal, conjunctival, and lacrimal gland tissues. In contrast, MUC5AC mRNA was only present in conjunctiva and lacrimal gland tissues, but not in cornea. Immunostaining demonstrates the co-staining of MUC19 and MUC5AC in conjunctival goblet cells. Consistent with the significant decrease of mucous secretion, both MUC19 and MUC5AC were decreased in conjunctiva of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome patients compared to normal subjects. Considering the contribution of gel-forming mucins to the homeostasis of the ocular surface, the decreased expression of MUC19 and MUC5AC in Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome patients suggested that these mucins may be involved in the disruption of the ocular surface homeostasis in this disease.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'The predictive power of using in vitro systems in combination with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to elucidate the relative importance of metabolism and carrier-mediated transport for the pharmacokinetics was evaluated using repaglinide as a model compound and pig as the test system. Repaglinide was chosen as model drug as previous studies in humans have shown that repaglinide is subject to both carrier-mediated influx to the liver cells and extensive hepatic metabolism. A multiple sampling site model in pig was chosen since it provides detailed in vivo information about the liver disposition. The underlying assumption was that both metabolism and carrier-mediated transport are also important for the hepatic disposition of repaglinide in pigs. Microsomes and primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro evaluation of enzyme kinetics and cellular disposition, respectively. In vitro data were generated both with and without metabolism inhibitors (ketoconazole, bezafibrate and trimethoprim) and transport inhibitors (diclofenac and quinine) providing input into a semi-PBPK model. In vivo data were also generated with and without the same enzyme and transporter inhibitors, alone and in combination. The pigs were given repaglinide as intravenous infusions with and without inhibitors in a sequential manner, i.e., a control phase and a test phase. Parameters describing the passive and carrier-mediated flux as well as metabolism were estimated in the control phase. The result from test phase was used to gain further knowledge of the findings from the control phase. The in vivo pig model enabled simultaneous sampling from plasma (pre- and postliver and peripheral) as well as from bile and urine. A semi-PBPK model consisting of 11 compartments (6 tissues + 5 sampling sites) was constructed for the mechanistic elucidation of the liver disposition, in vitro based in vivo predictions, sensitivity analyses and estimations of individual pharmacokinetic parameters. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that carrier-mediated influx was important for the liver disposition. The in vivo findings were supported by the result from the test phase where hepatic clearance (4.3 mL min\\\\u207b\\\\u00b9 kg\\\\u207b\\\\u00b9) was decreased by 29% (metabolism inhibition), 43% (transport inhibition) and 57% (metabolism + transport inhibition).

       " '\"\\\\\"MicroRNAs (miRNA) control numerous physiological and pathological processes. Typically, the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are processed by nuclear Drosha complex into ~70-nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA), which are further cleaved by cytoplasmic Dicer complex into ~21-nucleotide mature miRNAs. However, it is unclear how nascent pre-miRNAs are protected from ribonucleases, such as MCPIP1, that degrade pre-miRNAs to abort miRNA production. Here, we identify Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome antigen B (SSB)/La as a pre-miRNA-binding protein that regulates miRNA processing in vitro. All three RNA-binding motifs (LAM, RRM1, and RRM2) of La/SSB are required for efficient pre-miRNA binding. Intriguingly, La/SSB recognizes the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNAs, of which the majority lack a 3\\' UUU terminus. Moreover, La/SSB associates with endogenous pri-/pre-miRNAs and promotes miRNA biogenesis by stabilizing pre-miRNAs from nuclease (e.g. MCPIP1)-mediated decay in mammalian cells. Accordingly, we observed positive correlations between the expression status of La/SSB and Dicer in human cancer transcriptome and prognosis. These studies identify an important function of La/SSB as a global regulator of miRNA expression, and implicate stem-loop recognition as a major mechanism that mediates association between La/SSB and diverse RNA molecules.\\\\\"\"',\n",

However, questions have been raised regarding the potential risk of right ventricle (RV) rupture during treatment. In the present study, we evaluate our clinical experience of NPWT focusing on RV rupture and major bleeding complications and its potentially negative impact on 30-day mortality during an 11-year period. Serious bleeding complications during NPWT were reviewed for 176 patients treated for DSWI between January 1999 and April 2010. The 30-day mortality following DSWI was 1.1% (2/176). Four patients (2.3%) suffered bleeding from the RV rupture during NPWT of the sternal wound (two spontaneous and two debridement related). Furthermore, two patients had debridement-related bleedings from the venous bypass grafts during wound dressing change. The very low 30-day mortality (1.1%) following DSWI supports the use of NPWT. Overall, even if major bleeding complications may occur, the risk of RV rupture seems to be outweighed by the benefit of superior infection control. However, surgical experience is recommended when debriding sternal wounds and we recommend the use of a wound dressing, such as paraffin gauze, in order to protect the RV from direct contact with the polyurethane foam.\\'\"',\n",

Based on evaluation by members of the multidisciplinary staff at our pain clinic a pain management program could be offered individually or as group therapy. Methods Health related quality of life, psychometric tests, use of pain medication; socio-economic status and number of consultations in general practice were recorded at referral to the clinic and by postal questionnaires at follow-up 21 months later. The primary treatment outcome (treatment success) was defined as an improvement of at least 40 points in the physical component and/or the mental component of SF-36 from baseline to follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were changes in Beck\\'s Anxiety Inventory and Beck\\'s Depression Inventory, use of analgesics, work status and transfer income and number of consultations at the GP\\'s office due to the chronic pain condition. Results A total of 306 patients were included: 141 were treated individually and 165 were treated in groups. At follow-up, data were obtained from 189 patients (62%). Comparing baseline to follow-up data, 62% of group treated patients were treated successfully, compared with 41% of individually treated patients. Anxiety and depression were significantly improved in group treated patients but not in those treated individually. significantly more patients had work income (and less patients transfer income) among group treated, compared with individually treated. At follow-up use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was increased whereas use of tranquilizers and strong opioids was decreased in all patients. Number of consultations at their GPs due to chronic pain was significantly reduced in all patients. Conclusions Multidisciplinary treatment in a private pain clinic seems to have a long-term effect in relation to biological, psychological and social aspects of the chronic pain condition.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dry mouth and eyes, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms for its pathogenesis are complex. Here we reveal, for the first time, that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in SS-like NOD/Ltj mice and human patients were defective in immunoregulatory functions. Importantly, treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suppressed autoimmunity and restored salivary gland secretory function in both mouse models and SS patients. MSC treatment directed T cells toward Treg and Th2, while suppressing Th17 and Tfh responses, and alleviated disease symptoms. Infused MSCs migrated toward the inflammatory regions in a stromal cell-derived factor-1-dependent manner, as neutralization of stromal cell-derived factor-1 ligand CXCR4 abolished the effectiveness of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell treatment. Collectively, our study suggests that immunologic regulatory functions of MSCs play an important role in SS pathogenesis, and allogeneic MSC treatment may provide a novel, effective, and safe therapy for patients with SS.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Opioids constitute the basis for pharmacological treatment of moderate to severe pain in cancer pain and non-cancer pain patients. Their action is mediated by the activation of opioid receptors, which integrates the pain modulation system with other effects in the central nervous system including cognition resulting in complex interactions between pain, opioids and cognition. The literature on this complexity is sparse and information regarding the cognitive effects of opioids in chronic pain patients is substantially lacking. Two previous systematic reviews on cancer pain and non-cancer pain patients only using controlled studies were updated. Fourteen controlled studies on the cognitive effects of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain patients and eleven controlled studies in cancer pain patients were included and analyzed. Opioid treatment involved slightly opposite outcomes in the two patient groups: no effects or worsening of cognitive function in cancer pain patients and no effect or improvements in the chronic non-cancer pain patients, however, due to methodological limitations and a huge variety of designs definite conclusions are difficult to draw from the studies. In studies of higher quality of evidence opioid induced deficits in cognitive functioning were associated with dose increase and the use of supplemental doses of opioids in cancer patients. Future perspectives should comprise the conduction of high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving relevant control groups and validated neuropsychological assessments tools before and after opioid treatment in order to further explore the complex interaction between pain, opioids and cognition.\\'\"',\n",

In the context of the genome, topology is discussed at two interconnected and overlapping levels. The first focuses the DNA double helix itself, and includes alterations such as those triggered by DNA interacting proteins, processes which require the separation of the two DNA strands and DNA knotting. The second level is centered on the higher order organization of DNA into chromosomes, as well as dynamic conformational changes that occur on a chromosomal scale. Here, we refer to the first level as \\\\\"DNA topology\\\\\", the second as \\\\\"chromosome topology\\\\\". Since their identification, evidences suggesting that the so called structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes are central to the interplay between DNA and chromosome topology have accumulated. The SMC complexes regulate replication, segregation, repair and transcription, all processes which influence, and are influenced by, DNA and chromosome topology. This review focuses on the details of the relationship between the SMC complexes and topology.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren Syndrome (SS) is a systemic, autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands. Different clinical associations have been described for each of the diverse autoantibodies found in SS patients. Antibodies directed against the Ro/La ribonucleoprotein complexes have been correlated with younger age, more severe dysfunction of the exocrine glands and a higher prevalence of extraglandular manifestations. Anti-nuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors have been associated to extraglandular manifestations and an active immunological profile, while cryoglobulins are markers of more severe disease and correlate to lymphoma development and death. Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides are scarce in SS and have been linked in some cases to the development of non-erosive arthritis. Furthermore, the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies in the sera of primary SS patients is considered indicative of primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis, respectively. In addition, anti-centromere antibodies have been associated with a clinical phenotype intermediate between primary SS and systemic sclerosis, while antibodies against carbonic anhydrase have been related to renal tubular acidosis. Finally, an association of anti-muscarinic antibodies with cytopenias and a higher disease activity has also been described in primary SS. In conclusion, although not all of the above mentioned antibodies are useful for predicting distinct patient subgroups in SS, knowledge of the clinical associations of the different autoantibody specificities encountered in SS can advance our understanding of the disease and improve patient management.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Thymalfasin (thymosin-alpha 1) is an immunomodulating agent able to enhance the Thl immune response. It has been evaluated for its immunomodulatory activities and related therapeutic potential in several diseases, including chronic hepatitis B and C, AIDS, primary immunodeficiency diseases, depressed response to vaccination and cancer. The basis for effectiveness in these conditions is primarily through modulation of immunological responsiveness, as thymalfasin has been shown to have beneficial effects on numerous immune system parameters and to increase T-cell differentiation and maturation. Thymalfasin is responsible for reconstitution of immune function when thymic tissue is given back to thymectomized animals. In addition, thymalfasin has been shown to have efficacy in multiple experimental models of immune dysfunction, mainly, infectious diseases such as hepatitis (woodchuck) and influenza (mouse), and cancer such as melanoma (mouse) and colorectal carcinoma (rat) where thymalfasin has shown antitumor effects.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative, multisystem disorder characterized by severe phenotypes developing in infancy. Recently, mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated co-chaperone SIL1/BAP were identified to be the major cause of MSS. SIL1 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP, the ER Hsp70 orthologue, which plays an essential role in the folding and assembly of nascent polypeptide chains in the ER. SIL1 facilitates the release of BiP from unfolded protein substrates, enabling the subsequent folding and transport of the protein. Although most mutations leading to MSS result in deletion of the majority of the protein, three separate mutations have been identified that disrupt only the last five or six amino acids of the protein, which were assumed to encode a divergent ER retention motif. This study presents an in depth analysis of two of these mutants and reveals that the phenotype in the affected individuals is not likely to be due to depletion of SIL1 from the ER via secretion. Instead, our analyses show that the mutant proteins are particularly unstable and either form large aggregates in the ER or are rapidly degraded via the proteasome. In agreement with our findings, homology modeling suggests that the very C-terminal residues of SIL1 play a role in its structural integrity rather than its localization. These new insights might be a first step toward a possible pharmacological treatment of certain types of MSS by specifically stabilizing the mutant SIL1 protein.\\'\"',\n",

An educational model was translated into three educational steps: hands-on training, group discussions, and a theoretical lecture including scientific evidence about the preventive effect of oral hygiene on respiratory tract infections, and health care-associated pneumonia, among older people. Evidence-based oral hygiene education seems to be a feasible way to increase the motivation for daily oral care tasks among nursing staff, and thus to improve the oral hygiene status among the nursing home resident elderly.

Oral involvement in SS is mainly characterized by dryness, with a wide spectrum of symptoms, from mild-to-severe xerostomia with dysgeusia and tooth decay. The dysphagia, although common, does not correlate with the reduced salivary flow rate or the dysmotility that may be present. Dyspepsia, found in up to 23% of patients, may be associated with gastritis, reduced acid production, and antiparietal cell antibodies, but rarely pernicious anemia. Pancreatic involvement, although rare, includes pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency. The most common causes of liver disease are primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although abnormal liver tests are found in up to 49% of patients, they are usually mild. Although sicca syndrome, abnormal histology of the salivary glands, and abnormal sialograms are common in primary biliary cirrhosis, the antibodies to Ro/SSA or La/SSB antigens are infrequent. Xerostomia, sialadenitis, abnormal salivary flow rates, and abnormal Schirmer test in HCV vary widely among the studies, although the antibodies to Ro/SSA or La/SSB are only 1%.

Individual optimal designs, one general optimal design and one, for laboratory practice suitable, pragmatic optimal design (OD) were obtained. In addition, a standard design (STD-D), representing a commonly applied approach for metabolic stability investigations, was constructed. Simulations were performed for OD and STD-D by using the Michaelis-Menten (MM) equation, and enzyme kinetic parameters were estimated with both MM and a monoexponential decay. OD generated a better result (relative standard error) for 99% of the compounds and an equal or better result [(root mean square error (RMSE)] for 78% of the compounds in estimation of metabolic intrinsic clearance. Furthermore, high-quality estimates (RMSE < 30%) of both V(max) and K(m) could be obtained for a considerable number (26%) of the investigated compounds by using the suggested OD.

Previously, 1 and 2 were demonstrated to bind specifically to serotonergic 5-HT receptors. It may be suggested that chemical defense in G. barretti involves a synergistic action where one of the molecular targets is a 5-HT receptor. A mixture of 1 and 2 lowered the EC(50) of larval settlement as compared to the calculated theoretical additive effect of the two compounds. Moreover, an in situ sampling at 120 m depth using a remotely operated vehicle revealed that the sponge releases these two compounds to the ambient water. Thus, it is suggested that the synergistic action of 1 and 2 may benefit the sponge by reducing the expenditure of continuous production and release of its chemical defense substances.

       " '\"\\'During chromosome duplication the parental DNA molecule becomes overwound, or positively supercoiled, in the region ahead of the advancing replication fork. To allow fork progression, this superhelical tension has to be removed by topoisomerases, which operate by introducing transient DNA breaks. Positive supercoiling can also be diminished if the advancing fork rotates along the DNA helix, but then sister chromatid intertwinings form in its wake. Despite these insights it remains largely unknown how replication-induced superhelical stress is dealt with on linear, eukaryotic chromosomes. Here we show that this stress increases with the length of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. This highlights the possibility that superhelical tension is handled on a chromosome scale and not only within topologically closed chromosomal domains as the current view predicts. We found that inhibition of type I topoisomerases leads to a late replication delay of longer, but not shorter, chromosomes. This phenotype is also displayed by cells expressing mutated versions of the cohesin- and condensin-related Smc5/6 complex. The frequency of chromosomal association sites of the Smc5/6 complex increases in response to chromosome lengthening, chromosome circularization, or inactivation of topoisomerase 2, all having the potential to increase the number of sister chromatid intertwinings. Furthermore, non-functional Smc6 reduces the accumulation of intertwined sister plasmids after one round of replication in the absence of topoisomerase 2 function. Our results demonstrate that the length of a chromosome influences the need of superhelical tension release in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and allow us to propose a model where the Smc5/6 complex facilitates fork rotation by sequestering nascent chromatid intertwinings that form behind the replication machinery.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been linked to the onset and progression of many diseases. SIL1 is an adenine nucleotide exchange factor of the essential ER lumen chaperone HSPA5/BiP that senses ER stress and is involved in protein folding. Mutations in the Sil1 gene have been associated with Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome, hallmarks of which include ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. We have previously shown that loss of SIL1 function in mouse results in ER stress, ubiquitylated protein inclusions, and degeneration of specific Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Here, we report that overexpression of HYOU1/ORP150, an exchange factor that works in parallel to SIL1, prevents ER stress and rescues neurodegeneration in Sil1(-/-) mice, whereas decreasing expression of HYOU1 exacerbates these phenotypes. In addition, loss of DNAJC3/p58(IPK), a co-chaperone that promotes ATP hydrolysis by BiP, ameliorates ER stress and neurodegeneration in Sil1(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that alterations in the nucleotide exchange cycle of BiP cause ER stress and neurodegeneration in Sil1-deficient mice. Our results present the first evidence of important genetic modifiers of Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome, and provide additional pathways for therapeutic intervention for this, and other ER stress-induced, diseases.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Proteolysis is a key process for maintaining homeostasis in all living cells. The ability to degrade specific metabolic enzymes and regulatory proteins is essential for both cellular integrity and function. Equally important is the efficient removal of damaged or otherwise inactive polypeptides, especially during periods of developmental change or stress adaptation. Being one of the most metabolically active plant organelles, chloroplasts require various proteases to control overall protein quality. Much has been revealed about these chloroplast proteases over the last decade, and yet the identity of their native protein substrates remains elusive. In this chapter, we describe a variation upon a classic genetic approach to identify protease substrates based on the comparative protein degradation rates in wild-type and transgenic lines with impaired proteolytic activity. We have successfully used this approach with an in organello assay to identify numerous substrates for the stromal Clp protease from Arabidopsis thaliana, using both gene knockout mutants and antisense repression lines. In principle, the technique can be readily adapted for the study of other chloroplast proteases, and in other plant and algal species as the necessary genetic resources become available.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease (Clp) is an essential housekeeping enzyme in plant chloroplasts. It is by far the most complex of all known Clp proteases, with a proteolytic core consisting of multiple catalytic ClpP and noncatalytic ClpR subunits. It also includes a unique form of Clp protein of unknown function designated ClpT, two of which exist in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Inactivation of ClpT1 or ClpT2 significantly reduces the amount of Clp proteolytic core, whereas loss of both proves seedling lethal under autotrophic conditions. During assembly of the Clp proteolytic core, ClpT1 first binds to the P-ring (consisting of ClpP3-6 subunits) followed by ClpT2, and only then does the P-ring combine with the R-ring (ClpP1, ClpR1-4 subunits). Most of the ClpT proteins in chloroplasts exist in vivo as homodimers, which then apparently monomerize prior to association with the P-ring. Despite their relative abundance, however, the availability of both ClpT proteins is rate limiting for the core assembly, with the addition of recombinant ClpT1 and ClpT2 increasing core content up to fourfold. Overall, ClpT appears to regulate the assembly of the chloroplast Clp protease, revealing a new and sophisticated control mechanism on the activity of this vital protease in plants.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'In this study, a numerical approach to the fracture behavior in a three-unit zirconia-based fixed partial denture (FPD) framework was made under mechanical loading using a newly developed three-dimensional (3D) numerical modeling code. All the materials studied were treated heterogeneously and Weibull distribution law was applied to describe the heterogeneity. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion with tensile strength cut-off was utilized to judge whether the material was in an elastic or failed state. For validation, the fracture pattern obtained from the numerical modeling was compared with a laboratory test; they largely correlated with each other. Similar fracture initiation sites were detected both in the numerical simulation and in an earlier fractographic analysis. The numerical simulation applied in this study clearly described the stress distribution and fracture process of zirconia-based FPD frameworks, information that could not be gained from the laboratory tests alone. Thus, the newly developed 3D numerical modeling code seems to be an efficient tool for prediction of the fracture process in ceramic FPD frameworks.\\'\"',\n",

In the present study, skin biopsy for immunohistochemistry has been performed at the site of the microdialysis catheter to compare the findings with that of the microdialysis findings 24 h after insertion. Of the three named cytokines, concordance between the two investigated technologies was highest for IL8 (100%) followed by IL6 (70%) and IL1b (50%).

Recent insights into the pathogenesis of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome resulting from immunogenetic, hormonal, and epidemiologic evaluations as well as animal and in vitro studies are highlighted by this review. Evidence confirms that lymphocytic disturbances, including ectopic germinal center formation and aberrations of cellular signaling play a significant role in Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome. Although some of these features are unique to Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome, others are also found in a number of systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The underlying cause of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome remains largely enigmatic. However, distinct characteristics may provide the basis for the classification of the disease entities. Finally, an enhanced risk of lymphomagenesis is a well-known hallmark of primary Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome, indicating the central role of derangement of lymphocyte regulation.

The study was cross-sectional and included 253 patients with chronic pain at a tertiary pain centre. Patients were screened for addiction by a physician and a nurse. The addiction prevalence was 14.4% according to ICD-10 and 19.3% according to PC. A significant difference between the prevalence of addiction according to ICD-10 and to PC was found. The inter-rater reliability was 0.95 for ICD-10 and 0.93 for PC. The sensitivity of PC was 0.85 and the specificity was 0.96. According to PC patients classified as addicted were treated with significantly higher opioid doses, drank more alcohol, smoked more tobacco, used benzodiazepines and had higher levels of depression. According to ICD-10 patients classified as addicted used higher doses of opioids, drank more alcohol and had higher scores of anxiety and depression. High opioid doses, concomitant use of alcohol and younger age were risk factors. The risk profile for PC was different to ICD-10 by adding risk factors as concomitant use of benzodiazepines, having depression and low educational level.

Several RGS proteins have reduced expression or function in pathophysiological states, so strategies to increase RGS function would be useful.

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutation in the ALDH3A2 gene that codes for human fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome patients lack FALDH, which catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acids. The impaired FALDH activity leads to congenital ichthyosis, mental retardation and spasticity. The current lack of treatment is an impetus to develop gene therapy strategies by introducing functional FALDH into defective cells. We delivered human FALDH into keratinocytes of SLS patients using recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 vectors. Transduction of SLS keratinocytes resulted in an augmentation of FALDH activity comparable to phenotypically normal heterozygous carriers. Toxicity of long-chain aldehydes for FALDH-deficient cells decreased almost to the level of unaffected keratinocytes. Three-dimensional culture of corrected SLS keratinocytes revealed an ameliorated FALDH expression. These studies demonstrate the restoration of FALDH in human SLS cells supporting the concept of gene therapy as a potential future treatment option for SLS.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\\\\"Our previous work showed that immunization of rabbits with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified Ro60 (HNE-Ro60) accelerates autoimmunity. We extended this model into mice, hypothesizing that the severity of autoimmunity would be dependent on the degree of HNE modification of Ro60. Five groups of BALB/c mice (10/group) were used. Group I was immunized with Ro60. Groups II to IV were immunized with Ro60 modified with 0.4 mM (low), 2 mM (medium), and 10 mM (high) HNE, respectively. Group V controls received Freund\\'s adjuvant. A rapid abrogation of tolerance to Ro60/La antigens occurred in mice immunized with HNE-modified Ro60, especially in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 groups. Lymphocytic infiltration and significantly high decrement in salivary flow (37%) compared to controls was observed only in the high HNE-Ro60 group, suggesting induction of a Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome-like condition in this group. Anti-dsDNA occurred only in mice immunized with medium HNE-Ro60. This group did not have a significant decrement in salivary flow, suggesting induction of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like manifestation in this group. Significantly high antibodies to Ro60 were found in saliva of mice in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 and the Ro60 groups, as well as anti-HNE Ro60 in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 groups. Understanding the mechanism of this differential induction may help discriminate between these two autoimmune diseases.\\\\\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Testosterone is a major regulator of muscle mass. Little is known whether this is due to a direct stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or mediated by aromatization of testosterone to estradiol (E(2)), the ligand for the estrogen receptors (ERs), in peripheral tissues. In this study, we differentiated between the effects mediated by AR and ER by treating orchidectomized (orx) male mice for 5 weeks with E(2) or the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Both E(2) and DHT increased muscle weight and lean mass, although the effect was less marked after E(2) treatment. Studies of underlying mechanisms were performed using gene transcript profiling (microarray and real-time PCR) in skeletal muscle, and they demonstrated that E(2) regulated 51 genes and DHT regulated 187 genes, with 13 genes (=25% of E(2)-regulated genes) being regulated by both treatments. Both E(2) and DHT altered the expression of Fbxo32, a gene involved in skeletal muscle atrophy, affected the IGF1 system, and regulated genes involved in angiogenesis and the glutathione metabolic process. Only E(2) affected genes that regulate intermediary glucose and lipid metabolism, and only DHT increased the expression of genes involved in synaptic transmission and heme and polyamine biosynthesis. In summary, ER activation by E(2) treatment maintains skeletal muscle mass after orx. This effect is less marked than that of AR activation by DHT treatment, which completely prevented the effect of orx on muscle mass and was partly, but not fully, mediated via alternative pathways.\\'\"',\n",

The same questions were included in the survey in 2000 and, hence, it was possible to evaluate the trends in the past five years. In all, 20.2% of the adult Danish population has chronic pain. From year 2000-2005 the prevalence of chronic pain has remained stable. Generally, chronic pain was associated with female gender and increasing age. Higher prevalence of chronic pain were associated with being divorced, separated or widowed, having less than 10 years of education and high BMI. Musculoskeletal diseases (66.8%) were the most common cause for chronic pain and most persons with chronic pain rated their health and quality of life as poor. Persons with earlier or present cancer diagnosis were more likely to report chronic pain. A substantial part of persons with chronic pain were not satisfied with the examinations and treatments offered. In conclusion, over a five-year period the prevalence of chronic pain in Denmark has remained stable, but high.\\\\\"\"',\n",

Its prevalence in pregnant women is similar to that of the general population. In the absence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, most HCV-infected pregnant women do not have obstetric complications. Screening of pregnant women that are asymptomatic and do not have risk factors is not cost effective. A high hepatitis C viral load reportedly increases vertical transmission and is higher in women who are coinfected with HIV or who are intravenous drug users. Prolonged rupture of the membrane for more than 6 h, amniocentesis, and perineal lacerations increase the potential risk of perinatal transmission. Although the hepatitis C virus can be transmitted intrapartum, prevention by caesarean delivery is not generally indicated. The HCV virus can be found in maternal milk; however, breast feeding is not contraindicated. In conclusion, there are no antiviral treatment recommendations for HCV-infected women during pregnancy, or guidelines for the prevention of vertical transmission.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is central for the function of biological systems. Many clinically used drugs target GPCRs directly or target molecules involved in GPCR signaling. As an alternative to targeting receptors directly, one could modulate signaling cascades downstream of receptor activation. In recent years, there has been substantial interest in a family of proteins called regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. They modulate GPCR signaling by accelerating GTP hydrolysis on active Galpha subunits, thereby reducing the amplitude and duration of signaling. Modulating RGS activity would be a useful strategy to control GPCR signaling. An RGS inhibitor would be expected to enhance GPCR signaling and could do so in a tissue- or pathway-specific manner. Apart from the central GAP (GTPase accelerating protein) activity, many RGS proteins also have other functions like regulating protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization of signaling molecules, and protein translation. It is clear that these proteins serve important functions in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes, and they are emerging as potential drug targets. This chapter gives an overview of what is currently known about biological functions of RGS proteins based on in vivo and in vitro data. We also summarize the current status in targeting RGS proteins in drug discovery.\\'\"',\n",

Less common features are retinal changes, short stature, kyphoscoliosis, preterm birth, photophobia, reduction of visual acuity, seizures, and delayed speech. SLS is characterized by a genetic block in the oxidation of fatty alcohol to fatty acid because of deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a component of the fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase enzyme complex. As in other rare multisystem diseases, the diagnosis of SLS is often delayed. The definitive test for SLS is considered the measurement of FALDH or fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase in cultured skin fibroblasts. Nevertheless, if specific FALDH activity test or DNA FALDH gene mutation tests are not available (as in our country), a reliable diagnosis of SLS is also possible when it is based on the matching of peculiar clinical, histologic and ultrastructural, laboratoristic, and imaging features. The simultaneous presence of cutaneous histologic features including hyperkeratosis, orthokeratosis, thickening of granular layer, abnormal lamellar inclusions in the cytoplasm of granular and horny cells (demonstrated by light and electron microscopy) in a child with ichthyosis, and typical neurologic abnormalities is highly suggestive of SLS.

The immunologic process which occurs in this syndrome is B cell hyperactivity, which results in production of autoantibodies and immune complexes. SS can exist as a primary disorder or in association with other autoimmune processes. A usually mild, proximal and insidious inflammatory myopathy can occur in patients with SS with a broad clinical and pathological spectrum. Interstitial nephritis with mild proteinuria and tubular dysfunction is the most common renal manifestation of SS, but glomerular involvement due to immune complex deposition may also rarely occur [Goules et al. 2000]. There is an association of SS with hepatic abnormalities, as evidenced by abnormal liver biochemical tests or histological characteristics of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), portal tract fibrosis, or autoimmune hepatitis [Abraham et al. 2004]. The pathogenetic mechanism of liver involvement in SS is not clear, but it is possible that hepatic and salivary gland damage share a similar pathology.

We describe a 39-year-old man who manifested flaccid paralysis of 4 limbs.

A thorough survey for the cause of FS revealed that he had xerophthalmia and xerostomia accompanied by high anti-Ro antibody, positive Schirmer test, and delayed saliva excretion on sialoscintigraphy, confirming the diagnosis of SS. Potassium citrate, active vitamin D3, and high phosphate diet for his FS coupled with mycophenolate mofetil for SS resolved clinical symptoms and ameliorated renal function. Early recognition of HP due to the underlying SS-related FS with prompt therapy not only could terminate potentially life-threatening hypokalemia, but also improve renal outcome.\\'\"',\n",

We studied two unrelated Italian SLS patients with ichthyosis, developmental delay, spastic diplegia and brain white matter disease. One patient was homozygous for a novel ALDH3A2 insertion mutation (c.767insA) in exon 5. The other SLS patient was a compound heterozygote for two previously reported mutations: a slice site mutation (c.1094C > T; S365L) in exon 7. Analysis of fibroblast RNA by RT-PCR indicated that the spice-site mutation caused skipping of exons 2 and 3. The c.1094C > T mutation, previously associated with two ALDH3A2 haplotypes, was found on a third distinct haplotype in our patient, which indicates that arose independently in this kindred.

       " '\"\\\\\"Sj\\\\u00f6gren\\'s syndrome (SS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of hitherto unknown origin. The characteristic hallmark of SS is focal lymphocytic infiltration and slow destruction of exocrine glands, such as lacrimal and salivary glands. Sicca symptoms and/or recurrent parotid gland swelling are often accompanied by fatigue. Clinically relevant extraglandular manifestations occur in more than 20% of patients with primary SS. The development of malignant B cell lymphoma is the most important complication, which affects about 5% of primary SS patients who are at higher risk to develop malignant B cell lymphoma, both when compared with the general population as well as with patients with SS secondary to other systemic autoimmune disorders. Treatment of sicca symptoms is primarily symptomatic, whereas glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and/or immunosuppressive drugs may be indicated for the treatment of extraglandular manifestations.

       " '\"\\'Marinesco-Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Mutation in the SIL1 gene accounts for the majority of MSS cases. However, some individuals with typical MSS without SIL1 mutations have been reported. In this study, we identified two novel mutations in a Japanese pedigree with MSS, one of which was an intragenic deletion not detected using the PCR-direct sequencing protocol. This family consisted of three affected siblings, an unaffected sibling and unaffected parents. We found a homozygous 5-bp deletion, del598-602(GAAGA), in exon 6 of all affected siblings by PCR. Thus, we expected that both parents would be heterozygous for the mutation. As expected, the father was heterozygous, whereas the mother demonstrated no mutations. We then carried out array comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR analyses, and identified an approximately 58 kb deletion in exon 6 in the patients and mother. As a result, the mother was hemizygous for a 58-kb deletion. The affected siblings contained two mutations, a 5-bp and a 58-kb deletion, resulting in SIL1 gene dysfunction. It is possible that some reported cases of MSS without base alterations in the SIL1 gene are caused by deletions rather than locus heterogeneity.\\'\"',\n",

In the 22nd week of her pregnancy, however, she developed abdominal belt-shaped numbness and sensory impairment followed by weakness of bilateral lower limb leading to difficulty of her gait. MR imaging revealed hyperintense lesions within the spinal cord extending from C2 to T2 vertebral level with marked spinal cord swelling, indicating relapse of myelitis associated with anti-AQP4 antibody. She was treated with intravenous corticosteroid with marked benefits for her neurological status; she was able to walk without assistance after the treatment. However, in the 30th week she relapsed with myelitis at T2 to T9 vertebral level on MR imaging. Intravenous steroid administration again elicited improvement. She delivered a baby via Caesarean section at 34 weeks of pregnancy. After delivery, she started taking oral corticosteroid as preventive therapy for further relapse of myelitis; thus far she has had no relapse at 7 months of follow-up. There are few reports regarding the influence of pregnancy on anti-AQP4 antibody-positive myelitis. Although further investigation should be done to clarify the difference of immunological changes during pregnancy between NMO and conventional MS, our case together with previous reports indicate increased risk of relapse during pregnancy in NMO. It is necessary to remain vigilant against possible risk of relapse during pregnancy in patients with NMO and/or positive anti-AQP4 antibody.

Male Coll-1alpha1-Arom mice had clearly increased total body BMD, trabecular BMD, cortical BMD, and cortical thickness associated with elevated osteoprotegerin mRNA levels and reduced number of osteoclasts (p < 0.01). Treatment of ovariectomized mice with T increased cortical and trabecular thickness in the Coll-1alpha1-Arom mice (p < 0.001) but not in the wildtype mice. In conclusion, elevated aromatase expression specifically in osteoblasts results in stimulatory estrogenic effects in bone without increasing serum E2 levels. Because osteoblast-specific aromatase expression results in an increased ER to AR activation ratio in bone, we propose that activation of ERs results in a more pronounced increase in bone mass than what is seen after activation of the AR. Development of osteoblast-specific inducers of aromatase expression might identify substances with stimulatory effects on bone without systemic adverse effects.\\'\"',\n",

To evaluate the effects of local Th1/Th2 deregulation, we generated a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses IL-12 in the lungs. IL-12 transgenic mice developed bronchial and alveolar abnormalities strikingly similar to those found in the lungs of Sj\\\\u00f6gren patients. Pathologically, lung abnormalities began at approximately 4 mo of age and were characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates around the bronchi, intraluminal periodic acid Schiff-positive debris, increased cell proliferation in the alveolar region, and increased interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Functionally, these abnormalities translated into decreased mucociliary clearance (P<0.05 vs. wild-type littermates) and increased oxidative stress (P<0.01). The pathological and functional abnormalities were accompanied by significant changes in lung natural killer (NK) cells. The number of NK cells was fourfold higher in IL-12 transgenic than wild-type lungs (20% of all lymphoid cells vs. 5%) during the first month of life. NK cells then decreased within a narrow window of time (from 30 to 50 days of age), reaching a nadir of approximately 2% on day 50, and remained at these low levels thereafter. This new mouse model highlights the role of IL-12 in the initiation of Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is caused by a deficiency of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), encoded by the ALDH3A2 gene. In animal studies, the expression of the murine ortholog of FALDH, has been shown to be under the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). In the present study, we investigated whether the hypolipidemic drug bezafibrate, which is a pan-agonist of all PPAR-isoforms, might induce FALDH activity in human fibroblasts of control subjects and SLS patients that still have some residual FALDH activity. Our results show that FALDH activity was induced 1.4-fold after a 3-day treatment with 800 microM bezafibrate in fibroblasts of control subjects. Interestingly, in fibroblasts of two SLS patients homozygous for the p.R228C substitution, FALDH activity could be induced to 37% of control values by bezafibrate treatment. mRNA analysis in fibroblasts of these patients also revealed a mean 1.8-fold induction of FALDH mRNA after bezafibrate treatment. No induction was observed in fibroblasts of patients with mutations that cause instability of FALDH mRNA or that result in a protein without any residual activity. These data suggest that bezafibrate treatment could be effective in patients with expression of FALDH protein and some residual enzyme activity. Further research is needed to resolve whether patients could benefit from treatment with bezafibrate.\\'\"',\n",

Here, we investigated, in an older male population from Sweden (<i>n</i> = 970; aged 71 \\\\u00b1 1 year), whether adherence to the Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI; based on recommendations from the World Health Organization) or the Mediterranean Diet (MD) is linked to sleep disturbances. The diet scores were calculated using a seven-day food diary, and self-reported sleep initiation or maintenance problems were assessed by questionnaires. When adjusted for potential confounders, no associations between dietary scores and sleep parameters were found. In contrast, low consumption of milk and dairy products -one of the dietary features of the MD -was associated with better subjective sleep initiation. This association was, however, not found in men with adequate reports of daily energy intake (~54% of the cohort). To summarize, our findings do not suggest that older men can mitigate perceived difficulties to fall and stay asleep by adhering to either the HDI or MD. Whether low consumption of milk and dairy products can facilitate sleep initiation must be confirmed in future studies by utilizing objective measures of sleep such as polysomnography. Finally, when investigating associations between dietary patterns and sleep, particular attention should be paid to the potential confounder of inadequate reporting of energy intake.\\'\"',\n",

We also aimed to identify risk factors for the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) overall and by subtype. Anemia of chronic disease and hypergammaglobulinemia were the most prevalent hematologic manifestations encountered at diagnosis and during the course of pSS. Univariate analysis between cytopenias and glandular manifestations revealed a statistically significant correlation between lymphocytopenia and parotid gland enlargement (p = 0.002), as well as between neutropenia and xerostomia (p = 0.019). Anemia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, the presence of monoclonal serum proteins, and cryoglobulinemia correlated significantly with the presence of extraglandular symptoms such as palpable purpura, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Lymphoma was diagnosed in 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4%-10%) of patients. Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MZBCLs) were the predominant histologic type (65%; 95% CI, 48.3%-79.4%), while diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) accounted for 17.5% (95% CI, 7.3%-32.8%) of all cases. The development of NHL in patients with pSS could be predicted by the presence of simple clinical and laboratory factors at diagnosis: neutropenia (p = 0.041), cryoglobulinemia (p = 0.008), splenomegaly (p = 0.006), lymphadenopathy (p = 0.021), and low C4 levels (p = 0.009). Patients carrying any of these factors had a more than 5-fold increased risk of NHL compared to patients with no risk factors at all. The above set of disease characteristics could predict subsequent development of MZBCL; the presence of lymphocytopenia (p = 0.044) at diagnosis served as a risk factor for the development of a non-MZBCL, most commonly DLBCL. Anemia of chronic disease and hypergammaglobulinemia are common hematologic manifestations at diagnosis and during the course of pSS.

The enzyme kinetics of seven compounds were determined using the multiple depletion curves method (MDCM), the traditional initial formation rate of metabolite method (IFRMM), and the \\\\\"in vitro t(1/2)\\\\\" method, and the parameter estimates that were derived from the three methods were compared. The impact of a change in enzyme activity during the incubation period on the parameter estimates and the possibility to correct for this were also investigated. The MDCM was in good overall agreement with the IFRMM. Correction for a change in enzyme activity was possible and resulted in a better concordance in CL(int) estimates. The robustness of the method in coping with different rates of substrate turnover and variable starting concentrations were also demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the limitations imposed by assumptions inherent in the in vitro t(1/2) method were demonstrated both experimentally and by simulations. This study demonstrates that the MDCM is a robust and efficient method for estimating enzyme kinetic variables with high accuracy and precision.

       " '\"\\'Particle size reduction is a traditional approach to increase the intestinal absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients with poor intestinal solubility, by increasing the particle dissolution rate. However, an increase in the dissolution rate cannot always fully explain the effects of nanoformulations, and a method of assessing the potential benefits of a nanoformulation in vivo would hence be of great value in drug development. A novel mathematical model of a nanoformulation, including interlinked descriptions of the hydrodynamics, particle dissolution and diffusion of particles and colloidal structures (CS), was developed to predict the combined in vivo effects of these mechanisms on drug absorption. The model successfully described previously reported in vivo observations of nanoformulated aprepitant in rats, at various drug concentrations and in the presence or absence of CS. The increase in absorption rate was explained as a direct consequence of the increased drug concentration at the membrane, caused by the contributing effects of the diffusion of both nanoparticles and CS into which the drug had partitioned. Further simulations supported the conclusion that the model can be applied during drug development to provide a priori assessments of the potential benefits of nanoformulations.\\'\"',\n",

On admission, neurological examination revealed paraplegia with extensor plantar reflex and sensory disturbance below Th 6 level.

Mutations in the human gene inactivate the enzyme and cause accumulation of fatty alcohols in Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome, a neurological disorder resulting in physical and mental handicaps. Microsomal FALDH was expressed in E. coli and purified. Using an in vitro activity assay an optimum pH of approximately 9.5 and temperature of approximately 35 degrees C were determined. Medium- and long-chain fatty aldehydes were converted to the corresponding acids and kinetic parameters determined. The enzyme showed high activity with heptanal, tetradecanal, hexadecanal and octadecanal with lower activities for the other tested substrates. The enzyme was also able to convert some fatty alcohol substrates to their corresponding aldehydes and acids, at 25-30% the rate of aldehyde oxidation. A structural model of FALDH has been constructed, and catalytically important residues have been proposed to be involved in alcohol and aldehyde oxidation: Gln-120, Glu-207, Cys-241, Phe-333, Tyr-410 and His-411.

Stimulation with the 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced P-T(185)/Y(187)-ERK2. This reduction could be blocked by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635. Pretreatment with the cholesterol sequestering agent, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, before adding 8-OH-DPAT, significantly counteracted the inhibitory influence of 8-OH-DPAT on P-T(185)/Y(187)-ERK2 and P-S(133)-CREB. These data indicate that reduction of cholesterol levels significantly influence signaling via 5-HT(1A) receptors in intact neurons.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'We herein report the finding of a 45-year-old woman suffered from Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome with progressive tetraparesis, who later developed systemic muscle atrophy and respiratory failure with a one-year clinical history. Neurological examinations revealed progressive tetraparesis with absent deep tendon reflexes, whereas no upper motor neuron signs were observed. The motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) were both completely normal, but the prolongation of distal motor latency in the median nerve and a decrease in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude were observed. We ascertained that a spontaneous discharge was detected in her upper and lower limbs on electromyography (EMG). Her neurological findings as well as the EMG findings closely correlated with those of motor neuron disease; however, she showed a motor paralytic bladder and also demonstrated a serum antibody reaction with 50 kDa spinal cord protein of the rat. A lumbar MR image showed an increased signal intensity of the cauda equina on a gadolinium-enhanced T1 weighted image. We consider the immune-mediated impairment of the motor nerve associated with Sj\\\\u00f6gren syndrome to be the cardinal pathogenesis of the present patient, even though treatment with oral corticosteroids did not ameliorate her symptoms.\\'\"',\n",

Early clinical manifestations of SS are primarily decreased tear and saliva secretion, leading to dry eye and dry mouth syndromes, but in its later stages, it can become systemic, even resulting in B cell lymphomas. The use of new animal models, coupled with new technologies, is providing exciting insights into the pathogenesis, genetic predisposition, and, possibly, early diagnosis of SS. This article reviews newly described features of SS identified in experimental animal models and their relationship to human disease. New technologies, such as genomics and proteomics, may permit identification of potential candidate genes and biomarkers for disease diagnosis. Current studies using appropriate animal models in parallel with studies of human subjects are rapidly establishing a foundation for new intervention strategies that go beyond merely treating symptoms.\\'\"',\n",

These movements changed the genetic composition of the continent\\'s inhabitants. The Holocene was also characterized by major changes in vegetation composition, which altered the environment occupied by the original hunter-gatherer populations. We aim to test to what extent vegetation change through time is associated with changes in population composition as a consequence of these migrations, or with changes in climate. Using ancient DNA in combination with geostatistical techniques, we produce detailed maps of ancient population movements, which allow us to visualize how these migrations unfolded through time and space. We find that the spread of Neolithic farmer ancestry had a two-pronged wavefront, in agreement with similar findings on the cultural spread of farming from radiocarbon-dated archaeological sites. This movement, however, did not have a strong association with changes in the vegetational landscape. In contrast, the Yamnaya migration speed was at least twice as fast and coincided with a reduction in the amount of broad-leaf forest and an increase in the amount of pasture and natural grasslands in the continent. We demonstrate the utility of integrating ancient genomes with archaeometric datasets in a spatiotemporal statistical framework, which we foresee will enable future studies of ancient populations\\' movements, and their putative effects on local fauna and flora.\\\\\"\"',\n",

It is not established whether long-term survivors of cancers in childhood and adolescence also have an increased use of analgesics. However, based on increased use of antidepressants and anxiolytics in long-term survivors of cancers in childhood and adolescence, we hypothesized that this group also had increased use of analgesics. Based on data from the 2 nationwide registers, the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prescription Database, a cohort of 5585 (52% males) long-term survivors of cancers in childhood, adolescence, and early adult life was established. Age- and sex-adjusted comparisons were made to the general population. The age-adjusted one-year periodic prevalence of receiving prescriptions of opioids, benzodiazepines, and benzodiazepine-related hypnotics in the study population was increased by 20% to 50%, and the one-year periodic prevalence of receiving prescriptions of gabapentinoids was approximately increased 2-fold compared to the general population. For paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, no difference was found. For those survivors, who were persistent or high-dose users of opioids, comedication with high doses of benzodiazepines and/or benzodiazepine-related hypnotics was far more common than among persistent and high-dose opioid users in the general population. The high prevalence of gabapentinoids may indicate increased prevalence of neuropathic pain in this group. The high degree of comedication with benzodiazepines and/or benzodiazepine-related hypnotics in survivors on persistent and high-dose opioids might be an indication of problematic opioid use or addiction.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'The role of inflammation in atherosclerotic disease is well established, but the role of autoantibodies against modified apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 remains unclear. The metabolic syndrome is associated with a proinflammatory state, a predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and an increased risk for atherosclerotic diseases. Previous studies have shown specific autoantibodies against modified apo B-100 (within LDL) to be related to human atherosclerotic disease. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether autoantibodies against modified apo B-100 are related to parameters of the metabolic syndrome, such as small dense LDL. Two hundred ninety-one healthy men were investigated for different metabolic, anthropometric, and inflammatory variables; LDL peak particle size; and distribution of LDL in 4 subfractions. Subjects were grouped according to LDL peak size > or = 23.5 nm (pattern A, n = 230) or <23.5 nm (pattern B, n = 61). Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies against 2 aldehyde-modified peptide sequences, denoted as 45 and 210, within apo B-100 were quantified. Levels of IgG(45), but not the other autoantibodies, were significantly higher in pattern B individuals (with a predominance of small dense LDL particles) compared with pattern A (P < .01). Relationships for both IgG(45) and IgG(210) with parameters typically associated with the metabolic syndrome were found. Only IgG(45) tended to be higher in individuals with the metabolic syndrome compared with those without (P = .07). We conclude that subjects with a predominance of small dense LDL particles have elevated concentrations of IgG(45) in the circulation, which reflect an activated immune response to a specific epitope of modified apo B-100.\\'\"',\n",

However, there is too little evidence-based knowledge of current and required enhancements of educators\\' competences in this field. The aim of this study was to describe social and healthcare educators\\' perceptions of their competence in education. The study had a qualitative design, based on interviews with educators and rooted in critical realism. Forty-eight participants were recruited from seven universities of applied sciences and two vocational colleges in Finland, with the assistance of contact persons nominated by the institutions. The inclusion criterion for participation was employment by an educational institution as a part-time or full-time, social and/or healthcare educator. Data were collected in the period February-April 2018. The participants were interviewed in 16 focus groups with two to five participants per group. The acquired data were subjected to inductive content analysis, which yielded 506 open codes, 48 sub-categories, nine categories and one main category. The educators\\' competence was defined as a multidimensional construct, including categories of educators\\' competences in practicing as an educator, subject, ethics, pedagogy, management and organisation, innovation and development, collaboration, handling cultural and linguistic diversity, and continuous professional development. Educators recognised the need for developing competence in innovation to meet rapid changes in a competitive and increasingly global sociopolitical environment. Enhancement of adaptability to rapid changes was recognised as a necessity. The findings have social value in identifying requirements to improve social and healthcare educators\\' competence by helping educational leadership to improve educational standards, construct a continuous education framework and create national and/or international curricula for teacher education degree programs to enhance the quality of education. We also suggest that educational leadership needs to establish, maintain and strengthen collaborative strategies to provide effective, adaptable support systems, involving educators and students, in their working practices.\\\\\"\"',\n",

Recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident cochaperone, were identified as a major cause of MSS. We here report four novel mutations in SIL1, including the first missense substitution p.Leu457Pro described in MSS. In addition, we excluded three functional candidate genes, HSPA5, HYOU1, and AARS, as causative genes in SIL1 mutation-negative patients. To understand the mechanisms of disturbed SIL1 function, we studied the subcellular localization of the missense mutant Leu457Pro protein in COS-1 cells. Moreover, we studied a mutant protein lacking the putative C-terminal ER retrieval signal. In contrast to the wild-type protein\\'s localization to ER and Golgi apparatus, both mutant proteins formed aggregates within the ER depending on the expression level. These data imply that aggregation of mutant proteins may contribute to MSS pathogenesis. The genetic background of a subgroup of patients with MSS remains uncovered.\\\\\"\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Several recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between the composition of the gut microbiota in infancy and subsequent development of allergic disease. Human milk is the major food in infancy and may thus profoundly influence the composition of the gut flora. Oligosaccharides in breast milk survive the passage through the stomach and are utilized by the gut microbiota. As the relationship between breast feeding and childhood allergy is controversial we hypothesized that the composition of oligosaccharides in breast milk might explain the controversy. Nine of the most abundant neutral oligosaccharides in human milk were analysed in colostrum samples from allergic and non-allergic women and related to subsequent development of allergy in their children. The carbohydrate fraction of the colostrum was separated by gel permeation chromatography and neutral oligosaccharides, tri- to hexasaccharides were collected. Neutral oligosaccharides were analysed with high-performance liquid chromatography. There was a large variation in the concentration of neutral oligosaccharides in colostrum, which could not be explained by the allergic status of the women. Allergic children consumed higher amounts of neutral oligosaccharides in total, although not significantly (p = 0.12). When different oligosaccharides were analysed separately, there was no significant difference in consumption between the infants who developed atopic allergy later (n = 9) and infants who did not (n = 11). Thus, the amount of neutral oligosaccharides in colostrum does not directly correlate with maternal allergy, nor with allergy development in children up to 18 months of age.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Sj\\\\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and ALDH10) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the ALDH3A2 gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons. Twelve splice-site mutations have been demonstrated to cause aberrant splicing in cultured fibroblasts. To date, more than a dozen intragenic ALDH3A2 polymorphisms consisting of SNPs and one microsatellite marker have been characterized, although none of them alter the FALDH protein sequence. The striking mutational diversity in SLS offers a challenge for DNA-based diagnosis, but promises to provide a wealth of information about enzyme structure-function correlations.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\\\\"Emulation of natural disturbances is often regarded as a key measure to make forestry biodiversity-oriented. Consequently, extraction of logging residues is assumed to have little negative effect in comparison to extraction of dead wood mainly formed at natural disturbances. This is consistent with the evolutionary species pool hypothesis, which suggests that most species are evolutionary adapted to the naturally most abundant habitats. We tested this hypothesis for dead-wood-dependent macrofungi, lichens, and beetles in a boreal forest landscape in central Sweden, assuming that species are adapted to conditions similar to today\\'s unmanaged forest. No occurrence patterns, for the species groups which we investigated, were consistent with the hypothesis. Overall, stumps and snags had the highest habitat quality (measured as average population density with equal weight given to each species) and fine woody debris the lowest, which was unexpected, since stumps were the rarest dead-wood type in unmanaged forest. We conclude that the evolutionary species pool concept did not explain patterns of species\\' occurrences, and for two reasons, the concept is not reliable as a general rule of thumb: (1) what constitute habitats harbouring different species communities can only be understood from habitat-specific studies and (2) the suitability of habitats is affected by their biophysical characteristics. Thus, emulation of natural disturbances may promote biodiversity, but empirical studies are needed for each habitat to understand how natural disturbances should be emulated. We also conclude that stump extraction for bioenergy is associated with larger risks for biodiversity than fine woody debris extraction.\\\\\"\"',\n",

Therefore, we investigated relationships between dietary habits, AGEs and endothelial activation in men with isolated metabolic disturbances. Circulating markers of endothelial activation (soluble forms of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin and von Willebrand factor) and plasma N epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML, the predominant AGE in human plasma) were analyzed in a cross-sectional study of 294 healthy men.

Endothelial activation was higher in individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and was positively related to certain features of the syndrome (insulin, glucose, inflammation and obesity), but not to others (triacylglycerol and blood pressure). Dietary factors were related to endothelial activation, but CML was not. Multivariate analysis revealed energy and alcohol intake, along with insulin and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, to be positive predictors of endothelial activation. In this cohort of otherwise healthy men, endothelial activation was increased in individuals with the full metabolic syndrome, but not in those with only some of the components of the metabolic syndrome.

       " '\"\\'Sjogren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in the gene coding for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme necessary for the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acid as one enzyme of the fatty alcohol:nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-oxidoreductase complex (FAO). The impaired activity of FALDH leads to the clinical symptom triad of generalized ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spastic diplegia or tetraplegia. Treatment options are primarily symptomatic. Gene therapy by means of genetic reintroduction of the functional FALDH gene into defective cells has so far not been considered as a therapeutic modality. In order to pursue such an approach for SLS, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 vector containing the human cDNA of functional FALDH and evaluated its capability to restore the enzyme-deficiency in a FALDH-deficient cell line resembling the gene defect of SLS. rAAV-2 transduction of FALDH-deficient cells, usually exhibiting less than 10% of normal FALDH activity, resulted in an increase of FALDH activity within the range of unaffected cells. Moreover, FALDH-transduced cells regained resistance over exposure to long chain aldehydes, which are otherwise toxic to FALDH-deficient cells. These results indicated that rAAV-2 vectors are able to restore FALDH-deficiency in a cell system resembling SLS. The findings give the first support to the concept that gene therapy might be a future option for the treatment of SLS.\\'\"',\n",

Joint and Unique MultiBlock Analysis (JUMBA) is an analysis method based on the OnPLS-algorithm that decomposes a set of matrices into joint parts containing variations shared with other connected matrices and variations that are unique for each single matrix. Mapping unique variations is important from a data integration perspective, since it certainly cannot be expected that all variation co-varies. In this work we used JUMBA for the integrated analysis of lipidomic, metabolomic and oxylipins data sets obtained from profiling of plasma samples from children infected with P. falciparum malaria. P. falciparum is one of the primary contributors to childhood mortality and obstetric complications in the developing world, which makes the development of new diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as a better understanding of the disease, of utmost importance. In the presented work, JUMBA made it possible to detect already known trends related to the disease progression, but also to discover new structures in the data connected to food intake and personal differences in metabolism. By separating the variation in each data set into joint and unique, JUMBA reduced the complexity of the analysis and facilitated the detection of samples and variables corresponding to specific structures across multiple data sets, and by doing this enabled fast interpretation of the studied system. All of this makes JUMBA a perfect choice for multiblock analysis of systems biology data.\\'\"',\n",

The proteomic analysis of the salivary peptide complex in the patient\\'s salivary fluid near diagnosis and after 6 months of pharmacological therapy revealed quantitative and mostly qualitative differences.

We performed an autopsy on a young female patient with primary SjS who had died suddenly during a meal, and we discuss the relationship between primary SjS and the cause of death. Eosinophilic change of the cardiomyocytes and severe arteriolosclerosis were observed within the myocardium. In the conduction system, lymphocyte infiltration was detected in the bundle of His, in addition to arteriosclerosis in the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node arteries. The cause of death was diagnosed as ischaemic heart disease induced by arteriolosclerosis: its development can probably be attributed mostly to primary SjS. It should thus be kept in mind that primary SjS can occasionally result in the development of cardiovascular complications, such as ischaemic heart disease, as well as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.\\\\\"\"',\n",

The cohort included 937 women and 73 men (ratio, 13:1), with a mean age of 53 years at diagnosis and 59 years at inclusion in the registry. Multivariate analysis showed that male patients had a lower frequency of thyroiditis, Raynaud phenomenon, and antinuclear antibodies. Young-onset patients had a low degree of sicca involvement (xerostomia and parotid enlargement) and a high frequency of immunologic markers (anti-Ro/SS-A and low C4 levels). Patients with disease duration of more than 10 years had a higher prevalence of xerophthalmia, parotid enlargement, lung involvement, and peripheral neuropathy in comparison with incident cases. The subset of patients with anti-Ro/La antibodies had the highest prevalence of most systemic, hematologic, and immunologic alterations (higher frequency of Raynaud phenomenon, altered parotid scintigraphy, positive salivary gland biopsy, peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia, and rheumatoid factor). Hypocomplementemia was associated with a higher frequency of vasculitis and lymphoma, and cryoglobulins with a higher frequency of parotid enlargement, vasculitis, and leukopenia.Epidemiologic, clinical, and analytical features have a significant impact on the clinical presentation of primary SS, influencing the results of the main diagnostic tests, the prevalence and diversity of extraglandular involvement, and the frequency of the main immunologic markers. Primary SS should be considered as a systemic autoimmune disease that can express in many guises beyond sicca involvement.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Many inhaled drugs are poorly water soluble, and the dissolution rate is often the rate-limiting step in the overall absorption process. To improve understanding of pulmonary drug dissolution, four poorly soluble inhalation compounds (AZD5423 (a developmental nonsteroidal glucocorticoid), budesonide, fluticasone furoate (FF), and fluticasone propionate (FP)) were administered as suspensions or dry powders to the well-established isolated perfused rat lung (IPL) model. Two particle size distributions (d50 = 1.2 \\\\u03bcm and d50 = 2.8 \\\\u03bcm) were investigated for AZD5423. The pulmonary absorption rates of the drugs from the suspensions and dry powders were compared with historical absorption data for solutions to improve understanding of the effects of dissolution on the overall pulmonary absorption process for poorly soluble inhaled drugs. A physiologically based biopharmaceutical in silico model was used to analyze the experimental IPL data and to estimate a dissolution parameter ( k<sub>ex\\\\\\\\xa0vivo</sub>). A similar in silico approach was applied to in vitro dissolution data from the literature to obtain an in vitro dissolution parameter ( k<sub>in\\\\\\\\xa0vitro</sub>). When FF, FP, and the larger particles of AZD5423 were administered as suspensions, drug dissolution was the rate-limiting step in the overall absorption process. However, this was not the case for budesonide, which has the highest aqueous solubility (61 \\\\u03bcM), and the smaller particles of AZD5423, probably because of the increased surface area available for dissolution (d50 = 1.2 \\\\u03bcm). The estimated dissolution parameters were ranked in accordance with the solubility of the drugs, and there was good agreement between k<sub>ex\\\\\\\\xa0vivo</sub> and k<sub>in\\\\\\\\xa0vitro</sub>. The dry powders of all the compounds were absorbed more slowly than the suspensions, indicating that wetting is an important parameter for the dissolution of dry powders. A wetting factor was introduced to the in silico model to explain the difference in absorption profiles between the suspensions and dry powders where AZD5423 had the poorest wettability followed by FP and FF. The IPL model in combination with an in silico model is a useful tool for investigating pulmonary dissolution and improving understanding of dissolution-related parameters for poorly soluble inhaled compounds.\\'\"',\n",

Through a multi-analytical approach based on 88 individuals from 37 different archaeological localities in which we combine strontium isotope and radiocarbon analyses together with anthropological investigations, we explore whether there are significant changes in human mobility patterns during this period. Overall, our data suggest that mobility of people seems to have been continuous throughout the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. However, our data also indicate a clear shift in mobility patterns from around 1600 BC onwards, with a larger variation in the geographical origin of the migrants, and potentially including more distant regions. This shift occurred during a transition period at the beginning of the Nordic Bronze Age at a time when society flourished, expanded and experienced an unprecedented economic growth, suggesting that these aspects were closely related.\\'\"',\n",

The overall incidence of poststernotomy mediastinitis is relatively low, between 1% and 3%, however, this complication is associated with a significant mortality, usually reported to vary between 10% and 25%. At the present time, there is no general consensus regarding the appropriate surgical approach to mediastinitis following open-heart surgery and a wide range of wound-healing strategies have been established for the treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis during the era of modern cardiac surgery. Conventional forms of treatment usually involve surgical revision with open dressings or closed irrigation, or reconstruction with vascularized soft tissue flaps such as omentum or pectoral muscle. Unfortunately, procedure-related morbidity is relatively frequent when using conventional treatments and the long-term clinical outcome has been unsatisfying. Vacuum-assisted closure is a novel treatment with an ingenious mechanism. This wound-healing technique is based on the application of local negative pressure to a wound. During the application of negative pressure to a sternal wound several advantageous features from conventional surgical treatment are combined. Recent publications have demonstrated encouraging clinical results, however, observations are still rather limited and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This review provides an overview of the etiology and common risk factors for deep sternal wound infections and presents the historical development of conventional therapies.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of long-term opioid treatment on pain, cognition, mood, sleep and quality of life in CNCP patients. Methods In this cross-sectional pilot study, two groups of patients with CNCP treated in a multidisciplinary pain center were selected: (1) opioid group: \\\\u226530 mg morphine equivalent/day for >4 weeks, and (2) control group: no opioid consumption for >4 weeks. Socio-demographic data, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and body mass index (BMI) were registered and pain (brief pain inventory), mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and quality of life (RAND 36-Item Health Survey) were assessed. Continuous Reaction Time and the Digit Span Test were used to evaluate cognitive function. Data was analyzed with a Fisher\\'s exact test and Wilcoxon two-sample test. Results Forty-two patients with CNCP were included (21 in each group). No differences regarding socio-demographics, smoking/alcohol habits and duration, type, or intensity of pain were found. More patients in the opioid group had significantly higher BMI (62% above BMI 25 vs. 33.3%, p\\\\\\\\u2009=\\\\\\\\u20090.042). Consequently, the subsequent data analyses were controlled for BMI. The two groups did not differ in pain, cognition, anxiety, depression, sleep or quality of life but both showed lower values than the normal standards. Further, the opioid group presented a tendency to lower ratings regarding pain and social function and performed below the normal cut off in the continuous reaction time. Conclusions No significant differences between the two groups were found regarding any of the above-mentioned variables. Interestingly, the patients assessed, regardless of taking opioids or not, could be classified with moderate pain intensity, anxiety and low quality of sleep and life compared to norm standards.

Here we present a detailed study of a Late Neolithic mass grave from southern Poland belonging to the Globular Amphora culture and containing the remains of 15 men, women, and children, all killed by blows to the head. We sequenced their genomes to between 1.1- and 3.9-fold coverage and performed kinship analyses that demonstrate that the individuals belonged to a large extended family. The bodies had been carefully laid out according to kin relationships by someone who evidently knew the deceased. From a population genetic viewpoint, the people from Koszyce are clearly distinct from neighboring Corded Ware groups because of their lack of steppe-related ancestry. Although the reason for the massacre is unknown, it is possible that it was connected with the expansion of Corded Ware groups, which may have resulted in competition for resources and violent conflict. Together with the archaeological evidence, these analyses provide an unprecedented level of insight into the kinship structure and social behavior of a Late Neolithic community.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Aluminium (Al) ions are one of the primary growth-limiting factors for plants on acid soils, globally restricting agriculture. Despite its impact, little is known about Al action in planta. Earlier work has indicated that, among other effects, Al induces DNA damage. However, the loss of major DNA damage response regulators, such SOG1, partially suppressed the growth reduction in plants seen on Al-containing media. This raised the question whether Al actually causes DNA damage and, if so, how. Here, we provide cytological and genetic data corroborating that exposure to Al leads to DNA double-strand breaks. We find that the Al-induced damage specifically involves homology-dependent (HR) recombination repair. Using an Al toxicity assay that delivers higher Al concentrations than used in previous tests, we find that sog1 mutants become highly sensitive to Al. This indicates a multi-level response to Al-induced DNA damage in plants.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'The presence of ethanol in gastrointestinal (GI) fluids may increase the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. This suggests that intake of ethanol with such compounds could result in increased drug absorption in the stomach and duodenum because of the greater concentration gradient present. To test this hypothesis, in\\\\\\\\xa0vitro dissolution of 2 poorly soluble compounds (indomethacin and felodipine) was studied in simulated GI rat fluids in the presence or absence of ethanol. Results were used to predict plasma exposure of the compounds using the software PK-Sim. Finally, in\\\\\\\\xa0vivo plasma exposure in rats was investigated after oral dosing followed by immediate administration of water or ethanol. Despite increased solubility in GI fluids in the presence of ethanol, simulations predicted a negligible effect on absorption. This was confirmed in the rat study where oral intake of indomethacin or felodipine with ethanol did not increase in\\\\\\\\xa0vivo plasma exposure. A possible explanation for the lack of an effect may be that dilution, absorption, and transfer of ethanol upon arrival in the stomach resulted in intragastric and intraduodenal ethanol concentrations that did not reach the levels required to affect local solubility.\\'\"',\n",

       " '\"\\'Studies using HeLa cells expressing 5-HT7 receptors showed that detergent resistant membranous lipid rafts purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation contained 5-HT7 receptors and caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 siRNA-mediated knockdown or serotonin (5-HT) treatment caused significant reductions of maximum [3H]5-HT binding to 5-HT7 receptors and total immunoreactivity of membranous 5-HT7 receptors in intact cells. Co-treatment with 5-HT, caveolin-1 siRNA and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin had no additive effects on reducing maximum binding of [3H]5-HT to 5-HT7 receptors. 5-HT-mediated reduction of [3H]5-HT binding to 5-HT7 receptors was counteracted by genistein, but not by sucrose. Caveolin-1, specifically localized in cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, appears to regulate constitutive and agonist-stimulated cell surface levels of 5-HT7 receptors via a clathrin-independent mechanism.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Thyroid hormone, via its nuclear receptors TRalpha and TRbeta, controls metabolism by acting locally in peripheral tissues and centrally by regulating sympathetic signaling. We have defined aporeceptor regulation of metabolism by using mice heterozygous for a mutant TRalpha1 with low affinity to T3. The animals were hypermetabolic, showing strongly reduced fat depots, hyperphagia and resistance to diet-induced obesity accompanied by induction of genes involved in glucose handling and fatty acid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues. Increased lipid mobilization and beta-oxidation occurred in adipose tissues, whereas blockade of sympathetic signaling to brown adipose tissue normalized the metabolic phenotype despite a continued perturbed hormone signaling in this cell type. The results define a novel and important role for the TRalpha1 aporeceptor in governing metabolic homeostasis. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that a nuclear hormone receptor affecting sympathetic signaling can override its autonomous effects in peripheral tissues.\\'\"',\n",

A group of 542 consecutive unselected SLE patients was recruited. Diagnosis of SLE was made according to 1997 revised American College of Rheumatology SLE criteria; SS was diagnosed using the American-European classification criteria. Clinical and laboratory parameters in SLE patients with SS (SLE-SS) were compared with those in SLE patients without SS (SLE-no SS). Overall, SS was identified in 35 SLE patients (6.5%); the onset of SS preceded the development of SLE in 17 of them (48.6%). Compared with the SLE-no SS group (35.8 +/- 10.5 years), patients with SLE-SS (41.3 +/- 11.6 years) were significantly older (P = 0.003), had a higher frequency of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and anti-dsDNA antibodies, but had a significantly lower frequency of renal involvement. This study demonstrates that SLE-SS may be a subgroup of patients with characteristic clinical and laboratory features. To improve the treatment outcomes in SLE-SS patients, more specific treatment should be applied based on those factors.\\'\"',\n",
