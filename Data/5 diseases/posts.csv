1,Sjogrens?,5,dqxr99,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/dqxr99/sjogrens/,8,"Autoimmune or not?

Hi all,  

I have been suffering for about 5 years (25/m) with still no diagnosis. I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction.  

The first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop).  

Then around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows:  
Dry mouth  
Fatigue  
Neurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit)  
Excessive sweating  
Derealisation  
Sensitivity to loud noise  
Sensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight)  
Balance/coordination problems  
Joint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy)  
Alcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now) 
Wounds take a long time to heal  

I was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp.  

I have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative. Sjogrens syndrome seems to match my symptoms most closely but my rheumatologist doesn't believe in seronegative Sjogrens so has ruled that out, my blood tests were negative as was a lip biopsy.  

If anyone can hell I would be forever grateful!",1572799119.0

This eventually lead to blood work that came back ANA+ , high rheumatic factor.  I saw rheumatologist who sent me to a dermatologist for a biopsy and it came back pernio (or chronic chillblains) related to some unknown auto immune disorder.  Steroid cream cleared up the rash and I've been fine.  However, as it gets cold again, the rash is returning.  I do also have a history of Raynaud's that seems to be worsening, too and is occuring more frequently now because weather is turning colder.

Last week I had my routine primary doctor visit and my liver function tests came back elevated.  Dr. sent me to a GI who wanted to rule out auto immune liver hepatitis.  He also did a lot of blood work.  Everything normal except ANA+ (again) with very high ANA titre. And, my sjogren's antibody Ssa? came back positive.  Ssb was negative.

I've tried to condense this as much as possible.  Bottom line, I know I have some auto immune stuff going on.  But, do I have sjogren's?  I really don't have the symptoms ... I don't think?  I am unusually thirsty and must drink something non stop (I attributed this to following the KETO diet) and my eyes are a little scatchy in the AM.  A few times, I've asked my husband if I was snoring because I woke up with my mouth feeling dry all the way down my throat.  That's it.  Overall I feel great.

I guess my questions are, Did anyone get diagnosed with minimal symptoms?  Has anyone heard of false positives on the Sjogren Ssa test?  

Thanks for reading
I'm talking to my doctor later today, but would love some input from actual sufferers of Sjogren.",1572550858.0
4,Still feel like crap? Try vitamin D!,23,dozytt,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/dozytt/still_feel_like_crap_try_vitamin_d/,5,"Just a friendly reminder that a lot of people are deficient in vitamin D these days, especially folks with autoimmune conditions. If you've tried a bunch of other things, try supplementing vitamin D.

I keep forgetting this is a thing and every time I remember and take some I feel loads better within a week. Still not perfect, mind you, but better - much less fatigued and more positive, at least.

There's also some research that people who have trouble losing weight are often vitamin D deficient, so all the more reason to if that's you, in my opinion.

Of course check with a doctor and test your levels if you're able. Many doctors recommended to take 5000 IUs+ and it can be like night and day. (But of course this depends on you)

Last question - My rheum wants me to start Plaquenil, even though my lupus test came back negative and we still haven't gotten my results for the Sjogren's tests. Is that odd, that he's suggesting Plaquenil even though he hasn't pinned down a specific diagnosis?

10,Newly diagnosed--- I have a couple questions!,10,dl7iep,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/dl7iep/newly_diagnosed_i_have_a_couple_questions/,20,"Like the title says, I (29F) was diagnosed last week. I believe I've had this for years, however, because that's how long I've had certain symptoms.  It's amazing to have a diagnosis and be able to say ""okay, this is WHY this is happening."" But my doctor's suggestions are just to treat the symptoms as they come with OTC products like eye drops, throat lozenges and biotene products.

The problem I am having is I am not sure what to do/get to address three of the most persistent, day-ruining symptoms I deal with every day without fail.

1) My scalp itches!!! I only wash my hair twice a week. I also have Hashimotos, which leads to brittle hair, so I am careful about water temp, using gentle shampoos and not shampooing too often. However, my scalp has itched like I had lice or something for months now (don't worry, I for sure don't have lice haha). I've used head and shoulders shampoo, hair and scalp masks, exfoliating my scalp etc etc etc. There's no dandruff-- I'm not shedding skin. And there's no visible redness-- I check because I also have eczema and I need to make sure what is causing the itch and it's definitely not eczema. Has anyone found any solution?

2) I have tried all sorts of lotions--- from regular bath and body works stuff, to non scented gentle lotions and baby lotion, to medicated lotions, and still my skin is super dry. This happens particularly around any joints--- behind and to the side of my knees, my elbows, my ankles, my shoulders. Nothing seems to work. I even tried vaseline and just ended up a greasy mess.

3) My mouth isn't just getting dry--what saliva I do have is getting thick and very mucusy. It attaches to my throat and creates little bubbles of air and sometimes seals off my sinus passages. It's almost impossible to dislodge from coughing because it sticks like glue but when I DO manage to cough something out, it's completely clear but very viscous in texture. Sometimes, it will happen so suddenly that it will make me gag. I almost threw up in my car today, and I DID throw up a few days ago because of it. There is no actual sinus drain to speak of, no stuffy nose, so it's not sinus drain/snot/phlegm. I've tried biotene and while that works while I have an actual dry mouth, when I have this weird thickness in the back, the biotene seems to bond with it and make it thicker. It's weird and gross.

4) An abundance of Tonsil stones that aggravate my throat and a dry cough that has been going on for years. What helps prevent these??

12,Think I have Sjögren's,3,dkiv2a,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/dkiv2a/think_i_have_sjögrens/,4,"I was at the doctor on Friday. Briefly mentioning that I have a very dry mouth and  must get up several times every night to drink, I asked if this could be caused by some medications I used to take some years ago, which had that as a side effect. Doc said no, that they would not have that effect years after I stopped taking them, and that the only disease she knew that could cause this was Sjogren's, but that she did not think I have any other symptoms. We go through common symptoms and I also have dry eyes (I am constantly having pain in my right eye, she told me maybe a year ago that this is due to dryness), I have a dry and sore throat; I don't think I have joint pain, but I do have other bodily pain, e.g. chronic shoulder pain and tendonitis, have issues related to digestion. Blood tests have recently shown some changes related to my lungs and white blood cells (if I understand the latter correctly). The worst thing though is none of the above, but that I feel so tired, both physically and mentally. Googling for symptoms in the past, Sjogren's did come up a few times, but I don't think I really wanted to seriously entertain the thought. Now, however, I am quite sure I have it.  


Was working on my MSc thesis, about 5 years ago, when I remember things changing (I am now in my mid-thirties). I didn't notice any dryness in my mouth, as I was on those medications that already gave this as a side effect, I just remember going from being healthy and active to becoming very tired. Had been tired and depressed before, so my strategy was to take it easy for a while, until my energy levels would become normal again, but it's like they just never did. While waiting for things to change I became seriously delayed with my thesis, in the end I just had to force myself to get it done, it was a daily struggle. Since then I have been working as a PhD candidate for a few years, it has been hard. I don't have the drive and motivation I used to have, I can't really work for 8 hours anymore (because of the flexibility of my position I have tried to work less on weekdays, but also work on Sunday's). It's like there are not enough hours in the day (even though I mostly just work, make dinner and walk my dog). I used to run 5-6 times a week before I started to change (feel sick), and have recently started again (progressing very slowly since I have chronic tendonitis). While I do feel better about myself and my body, I found myself frequently Googling if it is normal to feel so tired after exercise. Usually I come home feeling good, but wanting to go to sleep.  


I have to switch jobs soon, have been dreading working a 9 to 5 job, and now I will also need to spend some time finishing my PhD on my free time. Want it to work out, but I am anxious about the future (e.g., can I complete my PhD, will I be on sick leave a lot, will I end up on partial disability?).  I own a house with my partner who is a student, so I need to work full time. Ideally I'd like to run my own company so I can have more flexible working hours (I have been thinking about this for the past year), but I don't think it will be possible for at least a few years.

I know I need to go through the tests and get an official diagnosis, so I guess that's what's next. Of course I can not be 100 % certain that I have Sjogren's, but I feel quite certain. I don't know how long it will take for me to get a diagnosis, but probably some time (the public health care system in my county is not known for its efficiency). Being tired and under a lot of pressure had left me with a negative outlook on life. I had recently started to feel better, but it is now hard to accept that I could be chronically ill. Will do my best not to overthink this while I am still waiting to be diagnosed. Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading. Any feedback is also appreciated.",1571602567.0
13,My story - Huge problems with eyes/eyelids and suspicion of Sjogren's.,3,dk7pmq,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/dk7pmq/my_story_huge_problems_with_eyeseyelids_and/,18,"**Hey there. 35 male here.**

My story begins beginning of this year when I got my first hordeloum/stye in one of my eyelids. Whole eyelid swollen, red, looking really bad. Treated it with the help of doctors and eventually all was well.

Or so I thought... I have now had about 10 of those acute inflammations this year in total. Both eyes, both upper and lower eyelids. I've been running to doctors and been diagnosed with Blepharitis and meibom gland dysfunction. One mentioned I might have Ocular rosacea.

About 6 months in I noticed my eyes were extremely dry at times, constantly having to blink and eye drops not helping much. I've now been doing daily warm compress, massage and cleaning with a saline solution on my eyelids. I'm now also at the end of my 2 month doxycycline antibiotic treatment.

Recently, my eyes got so dry I have to wear an eye shield most of the day. I fear I'm not really getting better with this condition despite all my efforts.

**This is not the first time I have problems with dry eyes, and to list my history:**

* Eyes been dry before in periods
* Now blepharitis, meibom gland dysfunction and possibly ocular rosacea
* Diagnosed with Asthma (I believe this started after lung chlamydia. I've also had Mononucleosis). Symptoms started 10 years ago after a really bad lung infection. I'm still not sure it is Asthma but asthma medication is helping. One doctor said it was a type of asthma affecting small airways.
* I suffer from fatigue and pronounced burning feeling in my lungs after straining myself physically (During if I push hard but also 1-2 days after the strain), feel it is linked to my lung condition and always wondered since it doesn't seem like normal asthma.
* Also periods of having swollen parotid glands, also felt strongly this is linked to my lung condition. Haven't had this in a long time now though.
* Recent years I have felt like almost getting a panic attack from looking at the light from the sun (Not straight at it but just being outside when sun is shining bright).
* Had many teeth cavities, even though I brush and floss morning and evening it still seems like it might not be enough.
* I seem to be getting oral thrush every now and then (Whitish layer, throat, tongue and generally inside the mouth.)
* Hands get some type of rash during winter
* Skin is sensitive to sun and seems to become easily red and spotty
* Bread causes lots of air in my digestive system and generally feels like I should not eat it.

**Family:**

* My brother has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and hla-b27 antigen.
* Been suspected my mother has rheumatoid arthritis as well.
* Father does not have rheumatoid arthritis but knows it has been present on his side of the family too.

**Recently had some blood tests done:**

* ANA: 1:320 and speckled (Positive it seems?)
* Rheumatoid factor: <8.4 (Not positive?)
* ENA: 0.2 (Apparently normal)
* SSa, SSb negative (If I read my results correctly due to ENA being normal these are automatically also seen as negative?)

**What changed in my life before these eye problems started:**

* 4 months before all this started I moved to another apartment. I was also under a lot of stress during this time.
* 2-3 months before all this started I also changed my lung medication to Innovair: [https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html](https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html) [https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler](https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler)
* Got a new bed

* What are your thoughts? Any input or advice on what to do next is appreciated!

1. My main symptom has always been painful, usually daily swelling in partoid and submandibular glands.

I'm 46 yrs old and have symptoms that overlap between Sjogren's and Wegener's granulomatosis. I've tested positive for Wegener's for about 18 months and have had one retinal vein occlusion (blood clot in the retina). I started developing Sjogren's-like symptoms 90 days ago. I also live with mast cell activation syndrome (aka MCAS), fibromyalgia, dysautonomia/POTS, and other chronic illnesses.

Got a corneal burn (both eyes) in mid-July 2019 from accidentally looking in the direction of a ceiling light fixture while I was trying to check out some bugs on the ceiling. My eyes have never returned to normal, despite steroid eye drops. Still on steroid eye drops and started Restasis a week ago, all under care of an excellent ophthalmologist. He's the doc who told me my eye issues were autoimmune-related and asked me to discuss it with my rheumatologist.

Saw rheumatologist a week ago and he thinks I have lupus and Sjogren's, and am teetering on the edge of Wegener's. I'm descended from the lineage of a consanguineous marriage (my maternal great-grandmother married her 1st cousin), and my mother's side of the family has a lot of genetic and autoimmune diseases as a result, unfortunately.

I have to wear sunglasses at all times, indoors and outdoors, except in my apt., where I've changed all the bulbs to 15 watt bulbs. I still have to look away from my lighting fixtures, since the bulbs are all exposed and even at 15 watts, if I look at the bulb I'll get a corneal burn all over again. It doesn't matter how many Refresh drops I put in...severe light sensitivity remains. Doc told me it will take Restasis at least a month before it starts helping.

I can't drive -- my sunglasses are not strong enough for me to drive west during the 2nd half of the day when the sun is setting...and I have very dark, anti-glare lenses. I wear a wide-brimmed hat to block light that my sunglasses don't, like light from above my head or sunlight coming at me from the side, which can get behind my sunglasses. 

I asked my docs (rheum & oph) if over time the Restasis would restore my previous tolerance for indoor and outdoor light...they said they don't know.

For those of you who have lived with Sjogren's for a while, how do you tolerate sunlight? How do you drive if you can't tolerate sunlight?

Understandably, I also have excessive urine output.  (Some weird electrolyte imbalances and too much creatinine in my blood as well.). Docs are trying to figure out if I might have diabetes insipidus, hence the excessive thirst.

Has anyone had this experience where your fluid intake was though to be caused by Sjogrens' classic dry mouth, but in fact it was diabetes insipidus?",1570622408.0

I think I might have sj, but I wanted to see if others with sj have the same symptoms and could share their experience. I am absolutely fed up. I'm currently seeing a eye doctor, I'm having regular oil gland squeezes and I'm using manuka eye drops.

I have dry eyes and my lids are always swollen.
My vision is blurry most of the time and my eyes strain.
I get frequent headaches, especially towards the end of the day. I feel like someone who is dehydrated and it causes pressure in the front of my head and aches in my neck.
I am always thirsty, no matter how much water I drink i do not feel like I'm hydrated.
This year alone I have had several bouts of tonsillitis, to the point I was hospitalized and on antibiotics for 2 months. 
Generally my throat always feels dry.
The area under my eyes...cheekbone area aches most of the time.

Also, in the last couple of years I had a range of tests done for other health related things. 
I have had 2 tests come back with a positive ANA... at different times.
I didnt really think much of it at the time, I didnt really understand what it meant & just never followed it up. 

Would like to hear your thoughts.
Thank you.",1570459064.0

I just wanted to list some of my symptoms with y’all and see what y’all think? I’ll be getting a blood test in a few weeks. The symptoms that bother me the most are:

Cotton mouth always. My tongue feels like sandpaper. I constantly drinking or spraying biotene on my tongue. I always seem to have a white film even though I scrape my tongue twice daily. 

Dry eye. Worsens when wearing contacts. I use drops and they burn like hell each time. 

Muscle pain and muscle tightness, chronic. Morning stiffness daily. My back and buttocks are full of knots. 

Extreme fatigue, sometimes severe enough to feel I can’t keep my eyes open or move well. Insomnia at night, every night. 

I wake with swollen hands a lot and my joints will be stiff. 

Frequent headaches. Probably from muscle tension.

I have all the usual Sjögren’s symptoms (plus ankylosing spondylitis) but the one messing up my life is this strange mix of vertigo/lack of depth perception/dizziness/headache/lack of hand-eye coordination. Basically, at times I feel like I’m not sure where my feet are in relation to the floor (like getting off a boat but without the sense of motion), I feel like there is a tight band around my forehead, I can’t judge distance (I try to grab things and miss; have broken quite a few drinking glasses, error rate through the roof when typing)... I find myself not focusing my vision, I feel like I’m only half awake all of the sudden (clumsy but also poor judgement and just slow to think/react because doing anything makes it worse, so I just shut down)...Even when I’m sitting down and haven’t moved in an hour I sometimes suddenly feel like  I have motion sickness, but it’s not really nausea as much as just suddenly feeling really off balance.  (Inner ear tests fine). It’s gotten bad enough that I’m not really functioning. There are times I spend most of the day just sitting because I don’t want to move at all.  Sometime it lasts fifteen minutes, sometimes it will all day for several days in a row.

Usually I can’t tell what triggers it, but known triggers are: 
1) drinking cool or cold water = most common trigger (hot water or flavored drinks are usually okay; any icy drinks could trigger it.  I feel like drinks with electrolytes actually help mitigate it.). I should probably just not drink cold water anymore, but cool water is so delicious...
2) getting dehydrated 
3) any sort of exercise that gets my heart rate up at all, even just walking a block.
4) getting scared or nervous (again, anything that gets the heart rate up...)
5) sometimes eating will immediately trigger it; sometimes skipping a meal will
6) pain flare ups usually trigger it.

It seems to me like maybe an electrolyte issue but no sign of problems in my bloodwork.  Like most Americans, I eat plenty of salt and am almost always careful to stay well hydrated.  Doctor thinks it might be migraines (I have gotten sparkly vision a few times, but rarely), but since it started at the same time as the Sjögren’s, I feel like it’s more likely to be something Sjögren’s related.

Because this has been going on so long, and I'm again experiencing unexplained lung issues, I'm trying to write out a timeline to present to my doctor in hopes that she'll refer me to a rheumatologist. 

One persistent problem I have that I haven't seen mentioned in relation to Sjogrens is my feet peel, constantly. The bottoms, sides, and all around my toes. I'm talking sheets of skin, not flakes. If I wear shoes, my feet get burned. Hot, red, painful burn. Just like a sunburn. And then my feet peel, just like after a sunburn. My skin has been tested and no fungus is present. I mostly wear flip flops to avoid the burn but my feet still peel, just not nearly as bad. My feet have been peeling like this for about six years. One doctor told me I wash my feet too often.🤦‍♀️

Has anyone heard of anything like that? I'm not sure if I should list it.

Just as an FYI, my other symptoms are dry eyes, dry mouth, mouth tastes like salt ALL the time, intermittent bilateral parotid gland swelling, and Raynaud's.

In the middle of trying to figure out my salty mouth, the ENT's physician's assistant found a lump on my neck. Thyroid cancer. They no longer cared about my salty mouth and cancelled my appointment with the ENT to discuss lip biopsy. The head and neck surgeon who removed my thyroid told me not to do the lip biopsy because I'd end up with a permanently numb lip. I think it was his office who cancelled my ENT appointment. That was 2017.

Currently, I'm coughing, short of breath, occasionally tingly feet, hands, and even lips. Some weird chest pain with breathing. I had the same thing happen in 2014 and no one ever figured it out. It went away on its own after a month or so.

I have a congenital heart defect (discovered through all the testing in 2014) and my cardiologist just ruled out my heart as a cause of my current breathing issues.  I read something here about bronchiectasis and small fiber neuropathy. And now I'm wondering. I usually don't bother going back to the doctor's office because they can never seem to figure me out. 

I have one other weird symptom: my knee often hurts but it's not an injury type pain. It feels like bone pain. It doesn't hurt when I run or walk. It hurts when I'm sitting at my desk, driving my car, etc. If I press on the area of pain, it feels better.

I'm sorry this was all over the place. It's been a long, strange six years.

My girlfriend of 7 years, whom I live with, was diagnosed with Sjogrens earlier this year after two long and hard years of mysterious symptoms. Doctors are still trying to figure out the best treatment plan for her, as well as determine if she additionally has other autoimmune or neurological issues. All of her symptoms have been pretty debilitating and continue to get worse. We are doing everything in our power to get her healthy again as best as we know how. 

But it's been especially tough on her mentally. From doctors not knowing what Sjogrens even is, to doctors telling her she is lying, to friends not understanding when we have to cancel plans, to her not being able to keep a stable job due to frequent flare ups. The list goes on and on. 

We recently discovered there is a Walk for Sjogren’s nearby to raise money for the Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation. We had never heard of this before, but we are getting involved both to meet other people who suffer from the same illness and to raise money to help bring more awareness to Sjogren’s and help with research. Having been through the diagnosis process with my S.O. firsthand, it’s mind blowing how it takes 2-3 years on average for people to get diagnosed with this properly. 

Anyway, my question is: does anyone have any experience with these types of walks or with the Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation? Is it a legit foundation and will money raised actually go somewhere useful? 

My girlfriend is really struggling because she feels like so many people don’t understand or care. We are doing the walk with her close (but small) family. But outside of our little circle, a lot of our friends, colleagues, neighbors don’t really seem to care and aren’t showing her much support. And I am not talking about donations - even just moral support. It would mean the world if anyone could at least just write some kind words of advise on here for her. I just want the best for her, and overcoming the mental aspects of her life-changing illness has proven difficult.

I'm monitored by a rheumatologist who keeps an eye on my lab results and does twice a year physical exams of joints, eyes, blood pressure etc.   I have some irregular blood tests, but I feel great.  Joints feel fine. I describe myself as having the Sjogrens antibodies but no symptoms.

I told her my mouth doesn't feel dry; I'm just thirsty.  She checked my mouth and chuckled.  Doctor says I do have dry mouth; I just didn't have a frame of reference to compare.

The other night I was doing some reading and my eyes felt uncomfortable. Usually I chalk it up to fatigue.  Then it struck me that perhaps all along this was the Sjogrens dry eyes symptoms, and I just didn't recognize it.  

I'm wondering if I might be at the start of the descent towards full-blown Sjogrens symptoms.  I have no friends or family members with Sjogrens so Reddit has been my main source of expertise. It sounds like symptoms can be quite debilitating, or at least highly highly uncomfortable. I'm an active healthy person and the thought of not having that lifestyle is worrisome.  Should I anticipate a day soon when crawling out of bed hurts, swallowing is uncomfortable and I can't go anywhere without eyedrops?

I’m going to be headed to Vegas and LA at the end of November and Beginning of December and I am horrified and delighted at the prospect. 
Every time I fly, I end up with a painfully dry nose and nosebleeds as well as dry/cracked lips. 
I’m sure it’s going to be even worse this time, because being from New Orleans I live in a high humidity area (yet, still suffer, thanks immune system) and I’m literally going to the desert... in the winter. Also, we’re flying from NOLA to Vegas, then a few days later from Vegas to LA, and then from LA back to NOLA. So it’s not just one flight, it’s several, back to back. 

My sinuses are by far the worst part, followed closely with a lack of saliva, and my eyes are pretty well managed with Systane. 

At home, twice daily, I use Emla cream inside my nose to deaden the pain and then use Laneige lip sleeping mask on my lips, and yes, in my nose. 
(I use clean q-tips to dip from the pot.)

To further compound the issue, I have to use scopolamine patches to avoid air sickness (because the fluid in my ears dries up so fast on the plane), and that makes everything EVEN DRIER. 

So, please, if you have any tips or tricks or products that you use I’m looking for suggestions. 

I carry my Mario Badescu rosewater hydrating mist in a travel bottle as well to keep my skin as hydrated as possible.

65,Possible Sjogrens/lupus. Sigh.,5,cuinh3,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cuinh3/possible_sjogrenslupus_sigh/,12,"

Hi everyone. I’m new to this group bc I just had an ANA test which was positive along with positive SSA. Nothing else so far but seeing a rheumatologist Monday. 

In addition to autoimmune stuff I’m also dealing with heart issues. After giving birth in nov. 2017 I was officially DX with peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) in feb. 2018 a type of pregnancy induced heart failure.  I’m still on meds (metoprolol and lisinopril) but a recent echo showed my heart has improved. Still, Anytime I get a cold/virus I end up with chest pressure and shortness of breath. It typically goes away once the virus passes. But this time I’ve been sick for almost a month. 

After an ER visit, pcp, and cardio visits my echo and blood work were mostly normal. I’ve had a lung function test and they’ve prescribed inhalers for shortness of breath which comes and goes. I was still feeling bad after 2 weeks so I asked for and ANA test which came back positive and high SSA suggesting sjogrens and a host of other things like lupus (which my mom has).  So far theyve said nothing official other than “autoimmune condition” and costochondritis. So I decided to cut back on gluten and dairy to be on the safe side. 

In the past 3+ weeks I’ve had muscle aches, weird headaches that seem to move around my head and settle in my cheeks, back pain and tingling, muscle twitching, shortness of breath, chest pressure, random lightning chest pain that disappears, brain fog, and seemingly out of nowhere I woke up feeling like my stomach/esophagus was burning and vomited. I took tums and then finally Zantac which I guess helped. 

When one symptom ends a new one begins. Every time I go to the ER they tell me nothings wrong and I feel like an idiot. My anxiety is so high right now. Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. My husband, daughter, and I live about 6 hours away from family and this whole process has been such a rollercoaster. I’m just tired of not being believed by doctors. Or having to ask for certain tests. With the heart stuff I had to cold email a random doctor who thankfully responded. I’ve had to deal with doctors just stop responding to me like I’m an annoyance when all I want is to feel better. I have a toddler and I’m finishing up my PhD. I have so much left to do and I feel like my body is  slowing me down.",1566617361.0

Diagnosed with Sjogren's 2+ mos ago.  The main symptom is dry mouth.  Mild eye dryness, too.  ANA, anti-SSA & anti-SSB tests all positive.  Symptom onset was abrupt, after using a new toothpaste.
I've been on an anti-inflammatory diet (=no sugar, no wheat, very limited dairy and soy) since diagnosis.  Also switched to a gentle toothpaste and using Xylimelts at night, Spry gums and mints during the day.  I'm doing 45 min meditation/day and I've signed up for the 8-week MBSR class.
Like the headline says, lots of questions.
1.  Can my dry mouth symptoms improve from this point on?  (I've seen some improvement with the anti-inflammatory diet.)
2.  What about eye dryness?  (My Schirmer's test results were 9mm in one eye, 16mm in the other.  It's not bad at all.)
3.  Can my blood numbers go back to normal (=negative)?
4.  Any chance I will go back to feeling normal?  (I can point to the day the symptoms started, so I'm hoping they will resolve and the illness will go into remission.)

Finally:  I am looking for hope.  How long until we find a cure?  Would it be a gene therapy thing or something else?  Also, how long until they can repair damage to saliva glands?  (My rheumatologist said, Maybe 10 yrs.)  What about tear gland repair?

68,Sjogren's and Psoriatic Arthritis?,10,ct7h1b,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/ct7h1b/sjogrens_and_psoriatic_arthritis/,3,"Last year I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis after dealing with horrible pain, stiffness and fatigue. About a week before I was finally diagnosed, it became impossible to see in the sunlight. My eyes would involuntarily close and start gushing water. Also, my sinuses and mouth dry up often - they both feel constricted, which makes it very difficult to speak clearly (I'm in sales, so this part really sucks). My fingers have also been turning ice cold for no apparent reason, though I have no idea if it's related. 

My rheumatologist tested me for lupus, which he said came back negative. The ophthalmologist couldn't find any inflammation in my eyes, and said she couldn't see any dry eye. My doctor told me that lupus and Sjogren's Syndrome are not connected to psoriatic arthritis. Yet, I've continued to have these symptoms for months, no matter how much water I drink or Biotene or Saline I use.  If anything I feel like it's getting worse. The other night I had a random, firm lump show up under my tongue, which disappeared a few minutes later. According to the Google this can happen because of dry mouth. 

I trust my doc, but I finally decided to post here today after getting a random text message from my mom. Turns out she got diagnosed with Sjogren's today based on her blood work. She doesn't have any other autoimmune disease. It just seems too coincidental that I have the same symptoms she did.

She told me that she wanted to do labs for ANA, SSA and B, RA, and a ton of other things. I received a call from her office yesterday saying: ""Your ANA is positive and you have Sjogren's. We're going to refer you to a Rheumatologist for a further work up and treatment."" I was in shock, because I didn't expect to get any answers....I knew that Sjogren's was a possibility, but I just really didn't think that I'd test positive for it. I was caught off guard, so I didn't think to ask if I was SSA or SSB positive, but I'm assuming one was because of the ""...and you have Sjogren's"" statement.  (I should be able to see my lab results online by the end of the week.) 

I'm waiting to hear back regarding the Rheumatologist referral. I guess my real question is: are more tests, like the lip biopsy, typically necessary for treatment to occur or is that only necessary if the SSA or SSB are negative?

I’m scheduled to have a lip biopsy next Wednesday to confirm my rheumatologist suspicions of Sjogrens (positive ANA with anti-centromere pattern, negative SSA and SSB).

I’ve seen mixed reviews on the recovery from the biopsy, but based on your experience, do you think I will be okay to go by then?

Came back to bed for my usual routine of Advil and eye drops. With my eyes pretty much closed, I grabbed what I thought was my eye drop bottle, pried my eyes open enough to squeeze the drops in, and squirted decongestant spray in my right eye!  I blinked a few times and realized this stuff was really watery, and my eye lid had opened right away. Then I realized I had grabbed the wrong bottle off my cluttered nightstand.  You know, it worked better than my Systane drops!  I was able to compare things after I put my regular ""optimal dry eye"" drops in my left eye.

Okay, that paragraph took a while as I waited to be able to see.  No real side effects at this time.  No pain, and that eye actually feels better than my other eye, as in I can see more clearly without as much cloudiness.  The eye does feel a little numb but that's all.  I will see what happens I guess!

But it does make me wonder how if a plain sterile saline solution would work, especially in the morning when you really want to get your eyes open quickly.

I'm a 33 year old female. I've been having ridiculous dry eye symptoms coupled with eyelids that are dry, swollen, and thick. My OD is treating the symptoms, but keeps asking me if I have dry mouth or am achy--she's relentless about those questions, making me think she suspects that it's not just eye-related. I honestly don't know if I have dry mouth or not because I usually drink about 120 ounces of water a day (because it's good for you) and work out 5 days a week (so I don't know if I'm achy or not because I always feel stiff (painfully stuff), especially when I get up in the middle of the night and when I first wake up). The eyelid swelling and heaviness seem to be most bothersome in the morning and evenings--this morning my eyelids would barely open and close because my eye was so dry--like sandy almost--it's like my eyes just want to close.

I do have many other symptoms of Sjogrens: the front of my neck  has been very dry and wrinkly, I have a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck that have been evaluated by an ENT (He wasn't concerned with them as far as his soeciality goes.), increased heartburn (I've been taking SO many times), and my lips are always dry, cracked, and flaky. 

My mother has a rhumatoid autoimmune disorder, which I know puts me at a higher risk of developing one myself. 

I'm not a hypochondriac, so I don't really try to be an internet doctor and diagnose myself... Because all of ""symptoms"" could very well be unrelated. The thing that is absolutely driving me insane is my eyes!!!

I just started at a great job, just last week. And already, it looks like I'm going to have to miss a day of work due to a flare.

I have really bad salivary glands. My submandibular glands are affected. Since this summer's heat spell, my glands have been swollen and blocked constantly. Every day I have some amount of swelling. Every day I'm massaging mucus plugs out of my glands. It is extremely uncomfortable and distracting. It's like the urge to defecate, but in your mouth - that's the only way I can describe it.

I've been kept up all night with a blockage. And when I get this blocked, I know that the joint pain and fatigue will follow within a day or two. Its 3 am and I'm supposed to be up at 5 to cook my lunch and get ready for work.

I'm spitting into a glass to monitor what's coming out of the gland, and I cant even call that saliva. It's semi-solid bullshit. Cloudy water with wispy mucus and little bits of plug - because the massaging only breaks up what's in there.

I've been on prednisone since March, started at 50mg/day now down to 5mg/day, w/ 200mg Plaquenil 2x/day.

My rheum says I shouldn’t be experiencing any more hand pain (which is the main reason I went to the doctors in first place in March and they found something wrong; high Rheumatoid factor). And when I do have pain, I should take 4 200mg Aleve 3x/day for however long I need. Never mind it tears my stomach up after four days.

The mouth dryness is much better (who knew most ppl don't feel thirsty in their mouth?), but I’m still experiencing severe hand weakness -can’t hold things well, have a hard time driving as clutching the steering wheel causes pain in my finger knuckles, bending my hands feels like I have rubber bands I’m fighting & hand aches. Severe fatigue- I have 4 hours of useable time I would say. Six, if I'm lucky and excited about whatever I'm doing.

The pain has steadily progressed back to having to change my lifestyle again as the pred dose has dropped - I felt best pain wise at 10mg of pred and the 400mg of plaquenil/day.

So the reality check is; am I freaking crazy? Its been recommended by my Rheum, that once I get my depression/anxiety under control by meditation and therapy, that I’ll feel better as a whole.

&#x200B;

Just a quick post to check if anyone here has experienced something similar to what seems to be an unusual illness.

&#x200B;

I had two masses appear rapidly and synchronously approx. 3 months ago, one on each parotid gland, just below my ear, at the angle of my jaw. They are very hard, fixed, roughly ovoid, painless and currently around one inch in diameter. The skin above is completely normal.

&#x200B;

In the last couple of weeks I have developed a further solid, moveable mass, approx. the size of a peanut in my left cheek. I have also found a similar lump in my right cheek, about the size of a ball bearing.

&#x200B;

The main swellings were very large and appeared hamster-like previously, however they have shrunk recently and thankfully my head is much less spherical now. The ones in my cheeks appear to have shrunk a little too.

&#x200B;

I have no symptoms of dry eyes or dry mouth whatsoever. In fact I don't think I have any other symptoms at all.

&#x200B;

Suggested causes so far have been Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis and lymphoma. Sarcoidosis tests have come back negative so far and lymphoma seems extremely unlikely. Sjogren's also seems very unlikely to me but I thought I'd check in here.

Has anyone here had parotid swellings like this?

Sorry for the wall of text. I feel super helpless and I don't know what to do anymore.
I know I'm getting borderline paranoid, but I just had my lip biopsy come back negative (that is, grade 1 Chisholm and Mason, so slight infiltration only). All my antibodies came back negative, Schirmer test only slightly indicative.
I have had a lot of health issues for the past few years and the doctors try to explain it by psychosomatic reasons. I can see that my sleeping problems, fatigue, loss of appetite etc could all come from there. However, I have days when I just hurt all over, all the joints in my back, hip, knee and even feet hurt at a time, I have had neuropathy in my right arm for almost a year now (tingling sensation almost every day) and on some days pain and sensitivity around my jaw/ear area. I also have chronic sinusitis and had to undergo surgery, but every cold I catch just stays with me forever. I've had those pains and ailments occasionally since I was a child, always before, during and after I was ""sick"" for a few days or even weeks, kind of like flares in retrospect. I've had a genetic test done which showed increased chance of Sjogren's. That was after I've had most of the symptoms for about half a year, so nothing I'm trying to construct anything.
After the lip biopsy came back negative yesterday, the only option that's left is go back to antidepressants and therapy. I am well aware that a lot of symptoms could be described as being psychosomatic in nature. But not all of them. I feel like I'm not in touch with my body anymore. Every cell of my body is screaming that there's something wrong, that there must be a physical reason for how I feel. I've had a depression before and it felt way different. This feels like all my bodily ailments just tear my mental health apart, and I can't prove it to anyone. I'm willing to start taking antidepressants and work on therapy, but I just need to know if there's any chance something physical could have been missed. I read that lip biopsies could come back false negative especially in smokers, which I am. Does anyone happen to know of some rare cases where Sjogren's was only later diagnosed?

Sorry for the whining but I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't have that many people to talk about this topic. 
I had my lip biopsy yesterday. I've been having more health issues than usual in the last few years: fatigue, depressive episodes, dry eyes, dry mouth and thick mucous, tingling/burning sensation in my right arm almost every day, terrible joint pains every now and then, recurrent sinus infections until I had to have surgery etc. I was so devastated that I ordered the 23andMe genetic health test for Christmas and I came back saying I have a roughly 2x higher risk of SLE and Sjogren's. I've been running from one doctor to the next, all blood results came back negative until I had my eye doctor suggest Sjogren's as a possibility. I finally managed to find a rheumatologist who immediately ordered the lip biopsy, he also said that Sjogren's is not that unlikely. I'll get the results next week. 

The thing is, I'm more scared for the results to come back negative than anything else. I haven't even thought about how my life would look like if I actually got the diagnosis. All I know is that I really want some kind of explanation for how shitty I'm feeling. My family and friends constantly see me being sick or whining about this and that. My personality has changed so much in that I don't trust myself anymore, I don't make plans anymore because I'll cancel them last minute. All I want to do these days is stay at home and not bother anyone with my ailments. Nearly all the people I confide in have their secret tips of meditating, osteopathy, walking and what not. I have tried everything, but when I take like an hour walk outside, I come back home and I have to lie down because my whole body aches. I feel that no one understands how I really feel. 

My partner is still very supportive but it feels like I'm draining her energy with the lack of results. I have the feeling people soon won't believe me anymore. I just called my mum and told her about the lip biopsy, and she was full of herself as usual and didn't even ask what this test was for this time. 

I promise I will try my best and live with it, but I'm really desperate for the results. What do I do if it's not Sjogren's? Am I going crazy?",1562191346.0

123,How to approach your doctor about your self diagnosis of Sjogrens with looking like a hypochondriac?,10,c6793o,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/c6793o/how_to_approach_your_doctor_about_your_self/,21,"I have suspected I have Sjogrens for many years now.  I had to make a kind of emergency trip to the eye doctor last week when my always dry morning eye was suddenly painful, my normal drops stung, and my lids were swollen.  Turns out my eye (not the cornea) was abraded or something, he couldn't figure out what would have done that.  I told him my regular eye doc did that paper test and said, yep, you sure do have dry eye, but neither of them seemed concerned except to prescribe me those expensive drops.

Twenty years ago I quit smoking (am in my 60's now)  and was able to quit by using nicotine gum, then I couldn't stop that so switched to regular chewing gum and now can literally not do without it.  I always have a piece in my mouth, and also have to drink a lot of water just to be able to speak legibly, otherwise my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.

I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's about thirty years ago and my Levoxyl/Synthroid script keeps getting increased due to regular hsa tests   I also am prone to oral and facial cold sores (herpes, yuck) that got so bad I take a prophylactic dose of an antiviral daily.

Dental problems...forget it.  I just don't go anymore, they always cause a flare of my cold sores, especially inside my mouth (not canker sores.)  I have had so many root canals etc., go bad that my oral health is better if I just stay home and keep hygienic.

I guess lastly, the last few years I have started to feel just lousy.  So fatigued and joint and muscle pain that I have had to give up my favorite pastimes like hiking, dancing, and now my hands hurt if I keyboard to much. I can't take vacations anymore, long car or plane rides put my knees and hips in so much pain that it ruins the trip for everyone.  The doctors are stumped, and I am usually patted on the head and reminded that I am getting older...hence my worry about being labeled a hypochondriac.

There are other things, like swollen lymph nodes under my jaw, sore throat, have had xrays and the ana test, but nothing shows up.  

Anyway, how do you approach your doctor about a possible autoimmune disorder like Sjogrens.  They hate it when patients diagnose themselves, I think.  In any case, this has been helpful to write it all down.  Maybe it will help organize my thoughts if I decide to approach my doctor about Sjogrens.  And as you kids say,

About 4 months ago my GI symptoms got so severe from undiagnosed Celiacs that I got my GI referral, I’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy even to rule out the big bad C word since I also had pretty intense and intermittent rectal bleeding (sorry tmi) I lost about 30 lbs in a month and a half and that’s the other kicker I’ve been trying to pin down the cause of, I can eat exorbitant amounts of junk food and calories and MAYBE gain 3 lbs. it’s a constant battle to stay at my weight. My stomach is perpetually in upset in one form or another, I feel internal tremors and bizarre movement and popping sensations beyond normal gas bubbles. Then I developed heat and exercise intolerance problems and tachycardia that comes and goes, debilitating nausea and light-headedness, I’m actually wearing a ZIO patch for a week (primary wanted a month but we agreed on a week) that they are hoping to determine if it’s POTS or SVT from.

My CBC and Metabolic panels constantly come back “mostly” normal. My MPV and Anion gap are always very elevated and my RDW is recently getting pretty low. My kidney function seems to flip back and forth a lot in terms of functioning “too” well I was told and then being not so great. And I’ve even developed this bizarre Myoclonus (suspected terminology via consult the neuro hasn’t seen it but it started months ago as a twitch in my left thigh and has massively escalated, awaiting seeing my neuro again since it started becoming a daily problem) basically I’d have such odd muscle spasms/jerks that would cause me to repeatedly fall down or nearly fall down. I’m taking a low dose of Keppra that the ER prescribed with neuro consult to manage it because if I take more than half a pill of the Keppra I sleep for 4 days straight, I’ve noticed I’m highly sensitive to narcotic pain medication and medication with a sedating effect of any kind even antihistamines. I always wonder if that’s in part due to my dehydration problems. 

I have bizarre lines and ridges going both directions in my nails and my nail beds are shrinking by the day which is a more recent symptom, evidence of early clubbing in my nails even documented in ER and was curious if anyone else had a similar presentation of symptoms with their hands and nails.

All in all I have minimal background info on what the systemic results of this illness are and how it’s impacted others lives, I have nobody with anything close in my life and it makes it an even bigger struggle, so if anyone has tips or methods on explaining how this is so debilitating in everyday life in a way close ones and family members can grasp I’d also be eternally in debt. I get constantly belittled and insulted by my father that I live with due to being a single mother and I get called lazy and stupid and everything else in the book, they don’t understand the extent of my health problems and it’s a burden how much help I’ve needed help caring for my son at times, the guilt is causes is unrelenting. Luckily my son is beautiful and happy. My father has outright said it’s all in my head and the doctors will never find out what’s wrong with me and they never have gotten it right when I was young even, I was diagnosed with complex partial right temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy at the age of 3 that mostly produced absence seizures in the day and convulsive nocturnal ones that caused me to wet the bed until I was nearly 15.  A heart murmur that repaired itself, and like violently intense ADHD, I was heavily medicated on stimulants as a child just so I could attend public school and then my health was so poor as a teenager (mental and physical) that I had to do high school at home. I have a slight lazy eye that’s trained (mostly). But overall nothing too outrageous. 

My period started in like 4th grade which is relatively early and puberty hit me like a damn train. I get frequent painful symptomatic ovarian cysts but do not have PCOS. One instance of one rupturing and almost requiring surgery a couple of years ago. Intestinal problems around 18 that almost required surgery (impaction more or less I ate something that wasn’t food.) I’ve never had great health but it isn’t horrible in my opinion. Within the past months my period has gone from heavy and like clockwork to short, late, light or not even there, I get cramps between periods all the time and I can’t get my OB who is also my PCP to listen to me about how it isn’t normal or okay.  Because there’s a lot of other health problems going on he just doesn’t want to unless I make a separate appointment and even then he won’t indulge me FULLY. So it’s a waste of my effort and money and time. 

I attribute it in part to being born of a mother with gestational diabetes and in turn I was born 10 lbs and 3 months early, massively underdeveloped heart and lungs, NICU for a week before I could be handled. Lack of oxygen while my heart was restarted multiple times is a suspicion for cause of my epilepsy. Basically I was trying to breathe amniotic fluids still when I needed to breathe air, is how it was explained. I was born not breathing. 

I always have had deep curiosity about preemies and their likelihood to developing health problems later in life but I never find much online, however in my instance I feel there is a connection. Maybe that’s just for peace of mind though.

This has just been a crazy diagnostic ride, first they thought PID, then eosinophilic esophagitis, then diabetes, then MS, Parkinson’s, they’ve looked into so many freaking diseases and whatnot it’s a miracle my insurance hasn’t committed homicide or canned me somehow. Sorry for the poor format and post construction as I’m managing a turkey of a two year old and am on mobile! 

Also I’m curious about age of onset, as I’m a 26 y/o female. Symptoms that were more severe such as RCE developed over two years ago and have just gradually worsened. It’s taken 3 months for my doctor to even take my concerns seriously even with CONSTANT trips to urgent care and the emergency room for one problem or another, did anyone else face dismissal from their PCP?

Looking forward to some feedback and I hope everyone is doing well with their symptom management and treatment and making the best of the weather as well! You all are amazing! ❤️ Is this post is out of line in any way just let me know and I’ll remove it!",1558851457.0

Blood testing came back negative so he sent me to an Endocrinologist to see if I might have Diabetes Insipidus; that was also negative.  I'm getting desperate to find some relief so I want to be tested again.  
Question: Is a Rheumatologist the best specialist to get to a diagnosis; at least as the first step?

Also, if I do get a positive diagnosis; are any medications known to best address the dry mouth and dry eyes symptoms?  I am getting very confused while reading about various meds; seems like Plaquenil is a go-to, but I also see a lot about newer Biologics.  I'd like to go into this with some knowledge what the doc may or may not be recommending.  When I last saw the doctor I asked if I could do a short run of some medication to see if helped my symptoms and he gave me a solid ""no"" to that due side affects and such...

This is my first post (just joined), and I've very recently realized that this disease exists, and that I suffer from many symptoms of it. Over the past few years I've often been treated for ear infections, which are fairly chronic. A year or so ago it was mentioned that my salivery glands were swollen. This happens more frequently now, and a physician mentioned Sjogren's to me and asked what my other symptoms were. Turns out, my dry eye and mouth issues, pain and inflammation in my extremeties, malaise, and fatigue - even my digestive issues, are associated with Sjogren's. Yesterday, I had blood work done, but it seems like this is just the beginning of a long diagnostic process to determine the root cause.

&#x200B;

My question is to those who suffer swollen salivery glands. How do you treat it? I've been dealing with this dull, neverending ache and swollen cheeks for what seems like forever. Is there anything that can help relieve some of the pain outside of taking ibuprofen? Any advice?

As I go through the process, I'm sure I will post more frequently, and read through all of the other posts to learn a bit more about Sjogren's and how everyone here deals with it. Thanks for listening.

162,Metal fillings causing pain,3,bpvk3x,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/bpvk3x/metal_fillings_causing_pain/,0,"So I have had a tooth with a metal filling for 5+ years that caused me permanent pain and discomfort, if I ate something and my mouth was a bit acidic=PAIN, if I accidentally touched it with a cutlery=Like plugging a battery to it, if it's winter= PAIN PAIN PAIN AND MORE PAIN. Basically I can't keep warm in winter so the metal filling can't be warmed up by my body which then causes throbbing pain from it.   


The dentist who first gave me the stupid metal filling i complained about the pain to for 3 years ever time I saw him and every time he 'mansplained' in a super gaslighty way how it was all in my head or worse he filed it down further making it hurt even more. In the end I gave up and signed up with the local dental hospital and have then spent years on their waiting list to get it sorted and every dentist I've talked to about it in the building all said the same thing; 'No, OF COURSE if metal fillings gives you pain and discomfort we will need to mend it with white material' oh HALLELUJAAAAAHHHH! I was dumb enough to think....  


Went in today and the dentist fixing the tooth tells me whan I ask 'so they are both mended in white now?'  'yeah no, I used a metal filling on the tooth' (O\_O) WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!  


Being me I of course hope that going home with my new metal filling that doesn't have a crack down it will somehow magically be different this time (the old filling had cracked before it got fixed) and it's not it hurts just the same as the old mending and I've just wasted a whole sedation session on creating the exact same result that had haunted me for 5+ years...   


Having a bad flare up atm and I really REALLY needed this to be the one positive thing that I could get fixed during constant other pain but no, of course not. x\_x I have two teeth with white fillings and they have never caused any problems/pain nor broken for 17+ years.

But the worse started a couple days ago, I feel like I have the flu in some extent. A crushing headache that will not go away no matter what I take. Now a fever, feeling freezing just to be burning up 2 hours later. Joint pain in my foot making it difficult to walk. And a stiff neck and shoulders. Pretty much even laying in bed I'm miserable.

Most recently it happened when I started in a new department at work. Mid sentence when my supervisor was speaking to my college and I about a project we’re working on, he pauses. “Your eyes are really red”. 

Is that a question or a statement? 

I replied “I have eye problems” as I didn’t want to go down the whole auto immune explanation route. 
He replied “Oh ok I thought it was hayfever”...long pause...
Me: “Oh no it’s not that”...another pause, he seemed to want more of an explanation...”There’s not really much I can do about it” (trying to smile, but dying inside) 
He laughed and the sort of looks awkward and says “oh ok then” and starts talking about the project again. ——something really annoying about this particular comment is the company as a whole knows about my sjogrens and medical problems, they have accommodated me really well and have been really nice. Day to day colleagues...not so much. 

I’ve had this SO MANY TIMES. I don’t know how much more my self esteem can take. I am a strong person, but when one of my biggest insecurities is picked out in front of people I find it really hard to deal with. I hate it and I hate myself and people seem to point it out at the worst of times! 

Another time was when I was getting a tea before my first day at my new job. The guy behind the till seemed to think it was ok to just state that my eyes we’re red. In front of the whole queue and his colleges! 10 mins later the man at reception of my building asked if I had the flu because I “looked really ill” (I didn’t have the flu. I had also never seen this man before so how does he know how I normally look?). 

Another one was someone who I was aquatinted with, not a mate but he was around all the parties and get togethers I went too. Mid conversation when we were talking about something (I can’t even remember what) he replied to what I said with “is that why you always have red eyes then?” With a horrible smirk. Everyone just stood quiet and awkwardly.

I was also out for a works mates birthday a while back. Maybe about 8 of us sitting around a table. My work mate told me my eyes were as red as the devils dick. I went home early in tears that night. I hid my tears and just told my friend I was tired, but I broke down to my boyfriend when I got in the house. 

I’m lucky my boyfriend has been pretty good. And when he has been there when stuff has been said he has stuck up for me and he’s amazing. But unfortunately that doesn’t help my self esteem. I hate myself and these people make me hate myself even more. One minute I think I’m feeling better and then I get a comment like today at work. I’m finding it really difficult to deal with. 

My question is: Why do people think it’s ok to comment on this? What do I say back? I might ask this in a different thread too, maybe askreddit, where I can ask people who don’t suffer with auto immune diseases! Because I know you lot will know what its like to be asked these things!

I know it could be worse. But that doesn’t stop my heart sinking and my self esteem going down further than I ever thought it could. I hope someone gets this! Thanks for reading even if there are no answers.",1557978874.0

I am using every trick I can find. (I currently have two humidifiers pointing at my face and I can breathe without thinking about it for the first time days!) And then I found myself telling him that I might be wrong. Maybe this is just making me feel better because of the power of suggestion. Maybe it's placebo effect. (I love placebo effect, by the way. It works even if you know it's placebo! That's fantastic!) And he was there, playing devil's advocate for each of my symptoms and possible solutions. Making me feel, once again, like I'm making a big deal out of everyday pains and looking for patterns where there are none. He wasn't being mean. But that's all I've ever known - ""helpful"" people looking for ways I'm not sick while I'm talking about ways I am.

Why do I keep doing this to myself? Why do I let everyone else do it to me? I feel like crap. I struggle to breathe. I struggle to eat. Sleeping is about the only thing I can do pretty well right now.

This is real. I am sick.

This has been extremely helpful in lowering my overall anxiety levels. But I have also learned a bit about dryness & comfort levels.

Often I'll wake up at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and then get up, use the bathroom, take 4-5 gulps of water, yawn if I can (to produce tears), blink some more, and pop in a breathmint (lol). This makes me feel a _lot_ more comfortable. Then I'll sleep for another 30-90 minutes and feel very good while doing so, in that my symptoms aren't at all a problem.

This made me wonder about changing my overall sleep schedule to include more ""breaks"" of this kind. One benefit might be that the dryness is far less of a problem because I'm able to stay more hydrated and comfortable overall. In the past I used [sleepyti.me](sleepyti.me) to manage more restive sleep & wake junctures, and that helped a lot. After reading [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16964783) about sleeping in two four-hour segments, I thought about maybe combining the two approaches. For me, 4 hours might be just short enough that the most severe dryness buildup doesn't happen.

Ideas appreciated.,1,bgkjwv,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/bgkjwv/want_to_work_on_my_face_but_it_explodes_into/,15,"I've struggled with face dryness and red bumps on my face for about 15 years now. It started in my T-zone and spread to my cheeks, then to my temples and finally to my forehead right up to my hairline. 

This is just one of my symptoms but I want to focus on it this year and see what I can do to improve my facial care. Here's what I've tried:

- Eucerin face care: Increased reddening, shiny redness; stopped after 2 days because I had to be in public. I think of it as a face explosion.
- Lotions: A friend who sells cosmetics told me she had the ""perfect"" gentle cream that was meant for this kind of thing. It came in a 1 oz. tube and cost me $54. I put it on and it made my face explode into shiny raised bumps. I've had similar results with other lotions. I had to stop using it because I looked like a redness racoon and I had to go to meetings and things.
- Exfoliating. The dryness seems to create a need to exfoliate so I don't have dry bits all over my face. However I've always struggled with this because as soon as I exfoliate, the redness really shows. But, unlike with lotions, exfoliating gently and with water seems to result in an extra redness that doesn't last _as_ long, so I can do this at night and wake up with just my normal dots & redness.

Does anybody have recommendations? Should I have stuck with the lotions for longer? Does the shininess go away? I get good results with moisturizing my hands, which have always been very dry. I'm thinking of trying a bit of moisturizing oil at bedtime, next, using a dabbing motion to apply it. 

My hope is not only to _not_ have these face explosions, but to reduce my normal amount of redness and red dotting.

Thanks for any feedback.

P.S. Diet-wise you guys know the story. I feel like I've tried everything. Tried a no-sugar diet, then did no dairy, went gluten-free for years, and finally tried AIP after my gluten sensitivity subsided. None of the above seemed to have any impact on my sjogren's symptoms.",1556076478.0

I am learning about Sjögren’s Disease in preparation for April’s Sjögren’s Awareness Month. Layer after layer of the disease’s symptoms and mysteries and complications are swimming in front of my eyes. Blepharitis, neuropathies, gastroparesis, cirrhosis. I’m familiar with each as a single diagnosis, not an autoimmune cocktail. But there they are, a few among many, complications ready to shake the world and stir up trouble.

Add to that frustration, fear, anxiety, depression, isolation.

### Autoimmune disease speaks a thousand difficult languages.

As I share information about Sjögren’s in our social media, I want to remind everyone, no matter what their health status is, that just because a symptom can’t be easily seen, it is still important. Important for the medical team to know about and consider as a component of diagnosis and treatment. Important for the patient to know that she is not dreaming up symptoms to fulfill an autoimmune destiny. Important for friends, family, and coworkers to know that unseen symptoms are valid and can disrupt plans, goals, adventures.

Life.

### Sjögren’s. So many layers. Too few answers. But hope, always hope, on the horizon.

Hope from the medical community as they diagnose and treat patients and guide them through a maze of symptoms and opportunities. Hope from the research world as it studies antibodies and homes in on data that may shine light on potential treatments and cures. Hope from each Sjögren’s patient and their support network that each tomorrow will be a good day, a fulfilling day, an inspired day. Hope. Always hope.

I wonder how accurate the results of the biopsy are. Can they come back normal, even if I have Sjogren's?

And is the result more likely to be abnormal/pathologic when someone expercience dryness of the mouth? I don't really have issues with a dry mouth, more with a dry throat. Could the biopsy still be abnormal or is it unlikely because of the ""nearly normal"" function of my salivary glands?

It was so hard for her to get a diagnosis, mainly because in my country is really uncommon and because she had had many other different illnesses and pathologies. She has suffered so much but at least now she has a name for it. 

What specific things you suggest I can do to support her? (Other than being generally supporting I mean)

Back to my question, as I understand autoimmune disorders have a strong genetic component. My mom and I both have hypothyroidism (not sure if Hashimoto's though). I'm 27F and I don't want to be paranoid about Sjogrens or any other AI, but I want to be vigilant and aware of possible symptoms that I shouldn't ignore, or group of symptoms that come together. Are there any tests that I can take maybe yearly to check for something?

We originally thought I was suffering from Sjögren Syndrome since I check all the boxes, however the auto-immune test were negative so the rheumatologist concluded I suffer from a non-immunological Sicca Syndrome. It’s been 6 months now and in the meantime I’ve been screened for neurological disorders (everything is normal minus the neuropathic pain and tremor which I’m taking Lyrica for, I have to see a neuro-ophtalmologist for the eye problem unrelated to Sicca). The neurologist I saw last week still think the answer is a systemic or metabolic disorder and I’m planning to go see an internist doctor (diagnosis experts).

Does it remind you of something you could have heard or read? I’ve searched online and apparently some people were diagnosed with Sjögren solely on symptoms even though the ANA, SSA and SSB test and the lip biopsy were normal so 🤷‍♀️",1554058023.0

I am seemingly in perfect health by most any measure. I was referred to a rheumatologist by my opthalmologist. My visit was because of monocular polyopia. I see multiple of everything with each eye independently.

I was diagnosed with corneal abrasions caused by  keratoconjunctivitis sicca. She asked if my eyes felt dry, if I had trouble with dry mouth, joint pain, or dental issues.

Yes to all! These issues have been progressively causing increasing problems over the last few years with the xerostomia starting around Christmas.

The rheumatologist didn't want to explore further than the ANA screen, but he did prescribe salagen/pilocarpine 4x per day. It's basically a miracle drug, but it only lasts about 2 hour per dose.

I was diagnosed with Sjögrens in 2015. I wore contacts exclusively between 2002-2014, specifically focus dailies from 2004 on. I stopped wearing them because the dryness was unbearable. I didn’t think anything of it until my diagnosis. I attempted to get fitted for contacts in 2017, but the office wasn’t knowledgeable about Sjögrens and therefore unsympathic toward my needs. I’ve since switched offices & at my eye exam today was asked about contacts & decided to give it another shot. I was prescribed total 1 dailies. They felt amazing for the first hour and then got increasingly uncomfortable so I took them out after 4 hours. I was happy with this, I know contacts aren’t for me anymore but I am happy to have found something for those few times a year I might want to wear contacts. The doctor also mentioned a machine called Truetear to promote tear production. Basically you insert it into your nose & it sends a pulse which prompts tear production. He said he first came across the device after a friend’s tear ducts were damaged from chemo & he was prescribed it. My doctor doesn’t actually prescribe the device because the “overheard is too high” but suggested I look into it. He said it cost between $700-1200 for the machine, plus  the cost of the disposable nasal tips.

Gotten much worse over the past year. Been seeing TONS of doctors and all tests come back normal. Currently seeing my second rheumatologist - someone who is known for “finding stuff no one else can find.” 

Just got a bunch of results back. ANA and CRP are normal. SSA and SSB also normal. 

However, doc did an “Early Sjogrens Panel” that came up with some interesting results. Carbonic Anhydrase VI IgG was super high, Carbonic Anhydrase VI IgM was high, and Parotid Spec IgG was high. Also have a high A/G ratio. 

Been googling around to figure out what this might mean (I’m a professional researcher so I like to be informed and I know where to look and how to evaluate sources). I know more tests are needed for definitive diagnosis, but from what I’ve read it’s unclear if this panel is actually a good indicator of anything (some sources say it’s a good indicator of possible Sjogrens, some say it doesn’t mean much). Obviously I plan to talk to my doctor, but my appointment isn’t for another week and a half and I would like to have some idea what is going on when I go into the appointment. 

Sjogrens seems to make a LOT of sense for me and my symptoms, but after being told over and over that it’s all in my head, I’m very skeptical that this test means anything.

New to this subreddit, and recently diagnosed with Sjögren's, though I've been experiencing symptoms for nearly ten years. I saw my rheumatologist for the first time on Tuesday, and we're waiting for all my labs to come back, but based on what she's seen so far she already asked me to bump my 6-month recheck to 3 months.

I think, on the whole, that I have a mild strain of Sjögren's, at least in terms of symptoms. My biggest issues have been mild dry mouth (which, coupled with long-undiagnosed bruxism, has led to a lot of dental problems), fatigue, and dry eyes. The thing that made me think I might have Sjögren's in the first place is that when I cry, I don't actually produce tears. I haven't cried for ten years.

So, when I got my official diagnosis and she told me it was chronic, I lost it, breaking down into my sad tearless crying. Besides all the scariness that is autoimmune in general, the increased risk for lymphoma, and other potential nastiness, I am absolutely *devastated* by the thought of never crying again. I'm an emotional person, and right now am also clinically depressed. I have absolutely ached for the catharsis that comes with crying these past ten years. I just can't imagine never having this very basic, very necessary human experience again.

From initially discussing eye issues with doctors to diagnosis by a specialist, it took about a year and a half to start treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Syndrome. After that, I faced a lot of backlash from my mother and mother in law... As if the diagnoses were wrong despite x-rays and repeated blood work, infact my SS-A/SS-B values are approximately 9.0 (normal: 0-0.9) and Rheumatoid factors are 76 (normal: 0-14).

Albeit scary, a diagnosis was validating and relieving to me... The diagnoses gave an explanation for all the physical symptoms I had been either ignoring, treating with excessive ibuprofen, or trying to convince myself was ""normal"".

As someone with a very limited support group, I really value the internet as a source to redefine ""normal"". Sjogren's isn't normal. RA isn't normal....but amongst other people with these diagnoses I have learned that my symptoms ARE normal.

That's a powerful lesson.

Right now my wife is working to try to get some infusions of a drug due to a complication.  Our doc is hopeful they may help.

But, we are being denied by the insurance company due to some things missing from her medical record.

Over the years my wife has had many symptoms and we do report them, but we don't get to see the notes the physician records.  And, given the many symptoms, and time, we have to ask, ""Did we report them?""

So, our new practice is after the physician visit, we'll use the ""patient portal"" like MyChart, to document the visit from OUR perspective.

Like, ""On my visit on 2-8-19, we mentioned the symptom 1, symptom 2, and symptom 3.  You prescribed pill A for symptom 1, and we'll see about symptoms 2 and 3 once you have the lab results.  Is there anything else you told us during the visit?""

So, if you ever have to review all of your records, not only will you have the basic information provided by their patient portal, you will also have your side of the story.

My issue at the moment is that all my symptoms have been particularly bad over the last few months and I'm right in the middle of my PhD. A lot of my research involves going out on fieldwork in cold, wet weather, a lot of walking in difficult terrain and long days - fun right? 

To date I've sort of just powered through but lately I'm finding it more and more difficult. I haven't previously mentioned my diagnosis to my supervisor as I like to keep things private but I'm thinking I will have to as I don't think I can continue with my work load. The main issue with this is my supervisor is the most demanding, difficult person I have ever worked with. He thinks nothing of doing a 13/14 hour day of fieldwork himself and expects everyone to be of the same standard.

I suppose I'm just looking for any advice people have regarding informing their boss/ supervisor about medical issues or anything that could make my work more bearable. Also I'm just having a bit of a rant haha

The doctor told me beforehand they were just taking a sample of skin cells, and it would heal without a scar in less than a week. However, they made two incisions and removed some tissue from the front of my top lip slightly off from the center. I have a vertical cut line from where the  stitches were that looks almost like a cleft lip scar, there's a hard lump of scar tissue, some numbness, discoloration, and my lip looks lopsided, because they removed such a big chunk. The middle of the bottom part of my top lip is pulled off center (if that makes sense). It looks even worse when I smile.

The doctor told me to rub vaseline into the scar (which didn't seem to help) and apply hydrocortisone cream (which I didn't do because of the side effects). And she offered to use a laser to burn the top layer of skin off my lip, which I declined, because she said it might make it worse. Also she kept pushing back the healing time frame. After about six months, she said that's as good as it's gonna get, and if I care this much about a scar I should see a psychiatrist. I later saw a plastic surgeon who said he could cut out the scar, but that would still leave another scar. And I don't want more of my lip removed.

This  happened over ten years ago. For the first couple years, I massaged the scar practically every day with oils like sea buckthorn, jojoba, rosa mosqueta, coconut, squalane, essential oils, etc. I tried scar creams like mederma, a snail cream, and balms with herbs like comfrey and calendula. There's been almost no improvement. There's still the cut line that looks really bad in certain lighting and a hard lump of scar tissue. I know I can't regrow the tissue that was removed (please correct me if I'm wrong), but if I could dissolve some of the scar  tissue it might relax my lip and the middle wouldn't be pulled so far over.

Think hiking up a mountain at over 30C heat and only drinking because I feel my body getting weak. On the other hand there's always been shorter periods where I had an unstillable thirst and literally dreamed of the guy selling ice-cold beer in a sand desert.

There's been periods where my body doesn't seem to hold onto electrolytes and I end up with irregular heartbeat, acting up muscles, cramps, pins and needles, waking up in the morning with cramped up hand positions and aching joints. Pills tend to stick to my oesophagus. Over the past few years I have to pee every night even if I worked out in the evening and had the last cup of tea 3 hours before going to bed. And there have been shorter periods where I'd suddenly pee like crazy, lose 800gr of (water) weight from one morning to the other and all those symptoms are magnified, with very low blood pressure, constant coughing, potentially with shortness of breath and loss of near-sightedness. It seems my eye pressure drops when this happens. There are other periods where I suddenly get confused, memory loss, weak, tunnel vision, endlessly hungry, just stare ahead and by now I know that having salt stops this. Otherwise it goes on for 4-5 days, with some temporal improvements after dinner. Likewise, salt seems to stop the excessive thirst. There've also been periods where I literally longed for salt and licked the salt off crisps or did even crazier things. 

So far all blood tests have been ok apart from constantly low albumin, and low most electrolytes at one point or another. There might have been signs of a mild acidosis (low bicarbonate) during two particularly bad fluid losses with shortness of breath. 

Dry pretty much everything, depending on how dehydrated I am. Mouth is mostly ok, eyes can be dry especially in the morning. Very dry fingers, often constipated and very dry stools. During bad flare-ups capillaries sometimes burst. Possibly some kind of connective tissue issue: somewhat flexible, but mainly too much very stretchy skin on hands, feet, face, hypermobile feet bones/ankles and hands, and I can scratch my little finger joint with the thumb of the same hand. 

Family: my sister has problems with bones staying in place of many joints/her spine. Both sister and mother various autoimmune disorders. Me: hashimotos and pernicious anemia. 

Annoyingly I have yet to see any specialist doctor as just low albumin and various low electrolytes isn't enough to let me see one. Nothing else was ever found, but not much was ever tested. Living in new country now, thus lets try again. The reason I'm going to see a gp is because my vision went from -0.25/-0.5 to -0.75/-1 and +1/at times impossible to correct within 4 years, since this became more acute.

 he says the big symptom was that anytime in the past several years that I’ve had antibiotics I always end up feeling a lot better overall.  
Said I should speak with the rhumetest but I need to find one that is aware of the relationship between anabiotic’s and Sjögrens as most aren’t.    And if the one I talked to didn’t know about that I should just find another one.  He knows a good one.  But he’s two hours away in another state.  

So I saw one today and she said that there’s no relationship and she’s never heard of that

He was also saying that there’s a good chance my blood work would be coming up negative which makes it so hard to diagnose.  
I definitely have a whole lot of the symptoms. 


As best I can figure from my research antibiotics have no affect on Sjögren  itself but it seems like infections of the lymph nodes are very common in Sjögren. so maybe that’s what’s making me feel better

I wondered if anyone had any tips/experience with getting diagnosed on the NHS?

Background:

32F, Dx with Primary Sjogren's in 2016, also have PCOS w IR.

When I was initially dx, I had bloodwork done and had a weak positive ANA but it had a cytoplasmic speckled pattern. I had a positive result for SSB (repeated many, many times) and elevated C3. I went on a steroid taper for the elevated C3.

Since diagnosis, I went on plaquenil 400 mg a day and recently gabapentin for muscle spasms and migraines.

This fall, I started having episodes where I would wake up in the middle of the night with a horrible stomach cramp that I couldn't speak through, run to the bathroom, and basically leave a toilet bowl full of blood. This happened to me about 3 times. I also have an ongoing issue with fissures, which my colorectal surgeon says looks like a pattern of autoimmune issues b/c they are on the anterior wall which is very unusual unless you have autoimmune issues in that arena.

Basically my GI/ colorectal person suspects lupus and a rare complication called bowel ischemia. My Rheumy saw me at the end of December and thought more like IBD, which runs in my family. I have been limited in my diet lately- a lot of things make me have stomach cramps or diharrhea. I have been basically eating pasta, chicken broth with white rice, rotisserie chicken, very cooked canned vegetables, and occasional mashed potatoes. Anything else causes me distress.

My Rheumy did bloodwork in late December but seemed unconcerned but she ordered more than normal. Anytime I have had an abnormal lab (high C3, other issues) her nurse just calls me and tells me what prescription they've phoned in, answers questions, etc. I got a call today that I have to go in and see my rheumy at the soonest possible appointment and essentially that they aren't really going to tell me what's happening or post my results to the portal. Now I have to wait until Monday. I am super pissed and very concerned. I wish they would just tell me what's wrong and then I can come in to follow up. They don't even call if labs are normal so I know something has to be off.

Have you ever had this experience? Am I super off base to be pissed and (very) worried?",1547800503.0

287,Coud this be Sjogrens Syndrome?,5,ad7t8a,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/ad7t8a/coud_this_be_sjogrens_syndrome/,8,"Hi everyone,

Sorry if this is long, I felt it would be best to describe my problems thoroughly. I'm just curious about some problems I've been having for a little over the past year that have been driving me wild and if it could possibly be related to sjogrens. Some of these problems began after having a Septoplasty about a year ago so I have no idea if they could be related to that.

Edit: If it is helpful at all, I am a 21 year old male living in the Midwest of the US

Dryness related symptoms:

* **Dry eyes:** This one I've actually had as long as I can remember. It isn't very severe but I find it get's worse in the winter and is at its worse when I'm in public walking around for an extended period of time and when I first wake up in the morning (if i don't use eye drops first thing in the morning it feels like there's shards of glass in my eyes). I had Lasik about 4 months ago and a very common side effect is dry eyes but surprisingly I've actually noticed a slight improvement in my dry eyes since getting it.
* **Extremely** **dry throat:** This one is almost unbearable. I will wake up every morning with the back of my throat completely barren, 0 moisture. It hurts very bad but thankfully get's better if I take a hot shower and inhale the steam.  It also happens less frequently at random times during the day.
* **Dry mouth:** This one is also not very severe and isn't as frequent as the others. My mouth will sometimes become dry and will not improve no matter how much water I drink. Between this and the dry throat I am almost always consuming liquids.
* **Dry nose:** I often wake up with dried blood in my nose
* **Dry skin:** I have to moisturize daily, especially my arms, hands, and face.

I have tried many humidifiers, none of which help at all. My home even has a humidifier built into the heater/AC.

Edit: For the mouth/throat related symptoms, I feel it is worth mentioning I have trouble with tonsil stones so that could be the cause.

Other symptoms:

* **Mild Raynaud's Syndrome:** This also started directly after my surgery. Last winter, completely out of the blue, my fingers began turning solid white whenever I got cold. It was only about 3 of my fingers. This winter, it hasn't been as severe. My fingers have not turned white but my hands are cold 90% of the time and go numb.
* **Joint/Muscle pain:** These aren't new symptoms either. I get debilitating pain in my elbow and knee joints along with pain in my arm muscles. It happens fairly infrequently though, maybe once a week. I have no joint swelling.
* **Fatigue:** Have very little energy and often feel tired despite having not done anything.
* **Post Nasal drip:** Ever since my septoplasty I have had globs of snot pouring down the back of my throat. I spit up probably 10-15 loogies a day. It's also annoying because due to the dryness of my throat they often become dried and stuck to the back of my throat causing discomfort.

I recently had a lot of blood work done due to the joint/muscle pain and fatigue, some related to autoimmune disorders (mostly pertaining to Rheumatoid arthritis). Nothing seems to indicate any autoimmune dysfunction.

* **ANA:** Negative
* **ESR:** 2 (range <15)
* **C-Reactive Protein:** .4 (range <8)
* **CCP Antibody IGG:** <16 (range <20)

Would these symptoms be a strong case for sjogrens and is it a possibility despite the blood work? None of my symptoms are very debilitating, they all seems somewhat mild but are very annoying. I would appreciate any insight you have to offer.",1546825856.0

I’ve gone back and forth between feeling great and not being able to get out of bed. I’m on plaquinil and imuran. Right before thanksgiving I ended up in the ER due to severe swelling in my glands and insane pain. I looked like Jaba the Hut. No joke. 10 days of antibiotics for a staff infection in my submandibular glands lead to thrush. At my last rheumatology appointment he wanted to do an ultrasound that found significant inflammation in both salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) and structural damage in my parotid glands. That let to a Sjogrens diagnosis. My bloodwork wasn’t positive for the ANA markers but my aPS/PT Igm was crazy high. I’m kind of freaking out. I had no idea that inflammation was happening so what else is being damaged in my body? I don’t know what all of this together looks like or what that high IgM number means. I’ve tried to research it but it makes no sense. His office is great and will answer any questions but I hate calling every day when I think of something new. He prescribed medication to increase saliva and I haven’t taken it. I don’t want to put more in my body but he made it sound like if I don’t I’m risking additional damage to other things. I’ve started researching the autoimmune diet and I’ll probably try it after the holidays. I don’t really know what my question is. Maybe just....does anyone else have similar diagnosis?

I don't have a diagnosis of anything, as I'm a bit doctor-adverse here. I haven't even been to the ophthalmologist for them, although often they are so dry I use artificial tears all day long, otherwise I can't see very well; it's a blur.

In April, I developed a very tenacious eyelid twitch, for no apparent reason. It won't stop and sometimes involves the entire side of my face, so, I googled it, along with the unspeakably bad fatigue I've been having too, and it sure sounds like I have Sjogrens.

I have had my thyroid removed, but my blood levels are fine, I have also had my parathyroids removed, but my calcium is in range, and when these drop, I know it. I have either diabetes or pre-diabetes too, which is what I thought might be causing the dry eyes, as it causes thirst.

My dentist mentioned my teeth were suddenly covered with odd cavities along the gum line, in the fronts, and he didn't know what to make of it, asking me if I had been tested for Sjogrens. I didn't think much of it then, and said no, I had not.

I have also been diagnosed with moderate gastroparesis, for no known reason. That involved many painful tests.

It is all always chalked up to ""anxiety"" since I have a documented anxiety disorder that has nothing to do with health anxiety or being nervous and is more like ""Fear of taking the subway."" This concept is too complex sometimes for doctors and nuance though.

The doctor I have now is really hard to get an appointment with. I got in and tried to ask him about my eye twitch, but he brushed it off, and I mentioned that I had blurry vision, but he said that was from being pre-diabetic. I asked him about my fatigue, and he said, ""You must be stressed out"" (no, I'm mainly retired, with a steady source of income, I work for pleasure a tiny bit, and I don't drink coffee, exercise when I can, and sleep a ton, thanks to medication that I take for my anxiety disorder -- I'm quite relaxed and enjoy my life very much, except for the part where I am in my body, feeling terrible).

I also have a very dry mouth and keep water with me all the time. For years. I've also lost my libido. My blood pressure is low as well, often 90/50 now. F, mid-40's, 19 BMI, family history of the diabetes.

What should I be doing better to advocate for myself, or is there a particular test I can ask for, and does it have to be through a PCP or can it be through an ophthalmologist, who would be easier to get an appointment with?

332,What's next?,2,9q8648,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/9q8648/whats_next/,8,"Hey all, I'm new here.  I may have Sjogren's but I have not been definitively diagnosed yet, I'm still in the very early stages.  I just saw my optometrist last week and while this disorder has been on my radar, I purposely avoided mentioning due to being wrong in the past and just described my symptoms to her.  Thankfully she volunteered the possibility of Sjogren's with instructions to see a dentist before coming back to coordinate with her again.  So, that was a huge relief.

Here's the short list of what's going on with me: dry, gritty eyes including waking up in the middle of the night feeling like my face is packed full of cotton; dry, itchy nose; history of apthous ulcers and dry mouth, which seem to be worsening; issues swallowing food and pills, voice hoarseness (I used to love to sing, lately I'm finding it painful); angular and possibly exfoliative cheilitis; GI issues including dyspepsia, gastritis, IBS, gastroparesis, GERD (these have all been diagnosed by my GI doctor); worsening asthma and increasing respiratory infections despite zero IgE-mediated allergies.  A few years ago I began having gallbladder attacks and had it taken out, only to find it was inflamed but acalculous.  I have a mental health history as well (mostly depression and anxiety) which doesn't seem to help anything.

My frustration with all of this is that most doctors I've seen only treat one system for symptoms. I get that, they're experts in a specific field and have so many patients to handle.  And while I can't say I like all of my doctors, I do genuinely believe they don't write me off.  They've put me through a ringer of tests, but everything comes back normal or inconclusive.  I just don't understand why I feel so bad if everything is within normal parameters.

Anyway, I apologize for that wall of text.  I'm trying not to let this get me down but it wears on you after a while, and I'm honestly afraid of pursuing this only to be told, yet again, that the bulk of it is in my mind.  I have a young family I need to be there for, I'm back in school for a health science program, and I live an active lifestyle.  I don't want to let this, whatever it is, defeat me.

So, I guess in addition to being a vent, I had some questions.  1) I had angular cheilitis several years ago that wouldn't heal for about 3 months.  I attributed it at the time to vitamin deficiency from a vegan diet and haven't had issues since returning to a more standard diet.  More recently though, I seem to have ""flares"" of painful exfoliative cheilitis and patches of dry numbness or red painful patches on my tongue.  Can these issues flare and remit, or are they pretty much constant once you develop them?  2) I became pregnant with my youngest following a bad ""flare"" 2.5 years ago.  She seems to be a healthy almost 2-year-old today.  She had no issues at birth and hasn't had anything pop up in any well checks.  Should I be at all concerned about heart block at this point?  3) How much does family history play into this?  My paternal grandmother had plaque psoriasis and my father may as well.  Additionally my maternal grandmother complained frequently of dry eyes and mouth, but I don't believe she was ever diagnosed with any autoimmune disorder, so perhaps it was just genetic or age-induced dry eye.

Wow, that was a lot.  Thank you for your time.  I know no one here is a doctor but the camaraderie is appreciated.",1540192574.0

For over a decade, my boyfriend has suffered from something his GP originally thought was Sjogren's. But his lip biopsy was negative so it just got forgotten about by the doctors, but he's still suffering. He has permanently dry lips and eyes - lips he uses moisturiser several times a day and eyes he wears non-prescription glasses to shield them but says the drops  don't help much. He had the eye test where they put a strip of paper on the eye and the opthamologist said the strip was completely dry. He has also had bouts of unexplained severe anaemia. They looked for internal bleeding but didn't find anything. He also has persistent heartburn that he takes medication for. I looked up Sjogren's and saw that anaemia and heartburn can be symptoms so I let him know - he wasn't aware.

Like I say, I'm just a curious person. An unanswered question nags at me. He's not too bothered at the moment, I don't think, he seems accustomed to it, but I just want to know - could the biopsy be a false negative or is it definitive?

Basically, the structure (or lack of) of our blood vessels in our jaws may explain why salivary glands are so hard-hit in SS. Blood vessels that don't attach to others tightly are permeable, and open up surrounding tissue to attack.

She told me it was ""Tsorgen's"" and after a bit of research here I am.
The dry mouth, splitting eye pain in sunlight, and so on were immediately recognizable symptoms that I struggle with in day to day life - but there was another symptom that I noticed as well: the dreaded ""mental fog."" 

I get fatigued very easily, and it's hard to stay on task - I had always figured I had ADD or some such, but perhaps there's an alternate explanation. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Particularly, experience with what can be done to stymie it? I've been taking vitamins, fish oil, and so on lately, which have been enormously helpful with my joints (especially my jaw), but perhaps there are other options as well. 

I've made a doctor's appointment and so on - hopefully they'll be able to set me straight, or refer me to a specialist.

It started about 4 years ago when I had a viral ear infection called Labrynthitis, and had a sudden onset of the following symptoms:  
Severe fatigue  
Dry mouth/difficulty swallowing  
Dry eyes/sensitivity to sunlight  
Dry hands/feet/lips   
Occasional loss of balance  
Frequent urination  
Impaired concentration/memory loss  
Digestive issues (IBS-like symptoms)  
Occasional loss of balance  
Excessive sweating  
Dental Cavaties   

I understand these may not all be related to Sjogrens but this is all that's happened to me since I had the infection.  

I have had so many blood tests over the past few years and found just elevated liver bloods and slightly low vit D. Had a couple scans on my liver and nothing showed up and I supplement vit D but feel no different.  

Finally I found out about Sjogrens and everything started to make sense, especially when I saw it's often triggered by viral infections so I suggested it to my GP to get tested. Had the ANA tests and nothing showed up so she emailed the results and my symptoms to a rheumy who said he doubts it's sjogrens and that's it? Didn't ask to see me or anything, just ruled it out through blood tests.  

I've been tested for all the normal things like diabetes/anaemia etc and nothing, so I'm not sure what the alternative could be? Is there something else I should be asking them to check for?

How were you all diagnosed? None of my doctors have mentioned Sjogren's at all, but I've been tested for RA, lupus, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Everything was negative (although there has been some confusion with my thyroid - it was underactive, now it's normal, and we're retesting next week).

I initially went to the doctor because I thought I had oral thrush - I had white patches, dry mouth, some minor itchiness. It turned out NOT to be oral thrush. To be honest I still don't know what it is - I'm going to a dental specialist on the 25th and will hopefully find out then. Nobody has been able to explain the dry mouth, though. I've been dealing with dry mouth for about a year now, sometimes better, sometimes worse (has been worse lately). I don't know if that is related to the white patches or not? An ENT and my dentist thought the white patches could be food related, possibly a new allergy, or somehow due to my fissured tongue. They couldn't explain the dry mouth. I was not taking antibiotics or anything else until recently (taking nortriptaline now, which might explain why it's been worse?). I have a dry cough sometimes as well, usually in the mornings.

I've also been seeing my doctor because I've been experiencing fatigue for at least 7 months. It has improved over the last couple weeks for no apparent reason, which has been nice, but I'm worried it's going to come back, and I wish I had an answer for why I was experiencing it in the first place.

I've also had mild joint pain in my hands for as long as I can remember. No swelling or redness or anything, just a dull sort of aching in my knuckles and sometimes wrist. I have had this since I was a child.

I'm taking the nortriptaline for depression and my doctor said it may help with the fatigue, but I actually noticed that the fatigue had improved the day before I started taking it. So I don't know if it really is or not.

I don't usually have dry eyes, though.

Anyway, I'm just wondering about the diagnostic process. This is the only thing that seems to explain my dry mouth, fatigue, and joint issues, but I'm not a doctor or any sort of health professional so I really don't know. Will be speaking with my doctor very soon. Thanks for any input!",1531024286.0

So I definitely have sjogrens, was diagnosed years ago and it runs in the family.  I read that it can cause pain.  

I have had severe bone pain since I was 4 (that's almost 25 years). I don't mean joints or muscles, I mean bones.  First was my right tibia,  it suddenly felt like it had been snapped in half. It has spread to every long bone in my body, and started hitting the small bones like my fingers and feet, and even my cheek bones too. Sometimes it's a sensation of cracking in half, or being twisted until breaking like you do with uncooked spaghetti noodles, or ice pick, or just like a semi truck ran me over or sometimes it's like the bone marrow was replaced with lava, often it feels like the trauma is being repeated, like the sadistic semi truck driver is running me over,  backing over me, and going again all day. It is constant and transient, I always have at least 1 bone in agony, but it can be all affected bones at once too, and 1 minute it might be the right tibia, the next second it's the left forearm. I hurt equally whether I'm running a marathon or laying in bed resting, heat/cold therapy has no effect  diet doesn't matter, no pattern has emerged at all.

I have had x-rays, head MRI and CT scans, excessive blood and urine tests, and nothing has been found.  No past or present Damage indicated in the bones, nothing.  It's gotten more intense over the years, to the point where I take gabapentin AND  strong narcotics just to function every day.

I always attributed my dry eyes and dry mouth to smoking, however now I really notice how dry my mouth is after having quit smoking for a month (about 2 years 1 pack a day till 1 month ago). Just want to know your opinions on my symptoms:

For long time, about 4 years now, Ive been on and off (very) dry eyes. Like tearing all day until I got oculotect. Also the sandy feeling I feel so similiar with. Also yellow/green fluid stuck in the eyes? Still have bit dry eyes after not smoking, but no more sandy eyeburns, use oculotect only when waking up.

Also, I drink a lot of water. I need at least 0.3-0.5 litre before I go to bed to satisfy my mouth. Sleep quite bad, always feel tired when I wake up.

Another thing is my fatigue. I sort of have bursts of fatigue? Mostly at 15:00-16:00 or after lunch I just want to lay in bed and really have to lay dwn. Goes hand in hand with very dry mouth.

For the rest I do not really feel muscle pain or in joints. Not noticably.  Also had eczema sinds  birth basically. Since I quit smoking way less redness in face but still a little bit. And stretch marks everywhere even though I gained just 6 kgs.

 Except for my eyes everything seems mild compared to you guys, so I wonder if this could be it. Have had all this for past years at least.  Just attributed it all to smoking but that only seemed to worsen the symptons since I still got them.

When I saw my eye doctor, she took pictures of my eyes because she said it was good to get a baseline when taking Plaquenil because after many years it can cause something called Bull's eye Maculopathy.  When the pictures came out, she said she already saw the beginning of Bull's Eye Maculopathy and after sending the report to my rheumatologist they decided it would be best for me to stop the Plaquenil. 

My next appointment with my rheumatologist isn't until July 3rd and basically my treatment is at a stand still. I'm still in a lot of pain, am not feeling good, and am extremely exhausted. This has also started affecting my performance at work and I'm a little worried about that as well. I'm still new to all this and am still learning but I feel so discouraged right now and have no idea what to do to help these symptoms.",1526464035.0
387,Does using a sauna & juicing help or hinder your symptoms?,3,8jld6p,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/8jld6p/does_using_a_sauna_juicing_help_or_hinder_your/,6,"hey fellow sjoggies, I'm going through a flare and trying to figure out the symptoms of it as they're more severe than normal. This of course would happen the couple days following me starting 2 new things to try and curb my flares...
the 2 things are:
1. sauna use
2. drinking celery juice.

These are two things i've read in a lot of places are meant to reduce inflammation so i've been going to the sauna weekly (spending about 30 mins in total but getting out to cool off every 5/10 mins) and juicing a couple sticks of celery the last couple of mornings when i get up. I wasn't expecting miracle improvements but I wasn't expecting what I got either, which is horrendous fatigue, headaches (that i dont normally get) along with extreme dislike for bright lights, and I'm quite feverish too. 
I haven't really felt like this after the sauna use up until today, and i've been going for 5 weeks now, so I'm not sure that is causing my issues, but it could be. Has anyone else ever experienced discomfort after doing either of these 2 things? Can you offer any alternatives or remedies for these symptoms?

In my experience with chronic illness I've noticed that the subject of dating and/or finding friends with such an illness pops up on a regular basis. Chronic illness of any sort is not only a naturally isolating condition but one which, for many reasons, makes mingling in the normal dating pool a tricky proposition. So I was a bit surprised that there was no dating app or platform for people in our shoes, and decided to make one.

/r/u4u --or, alternately, **Unwell 4 Unwell--is meant to function exactly as /r/r4r functions**, with the obvious difference that it will be a niche especially catered to the unwell. That means you don't have to dance around the topic and instead directly get to knowing people who understand, to some extent, what you're going through without worrying whether your health situation will be a barrier. 

I have no idea whether this will ever get enough traffic to function smoothly, but I figure there are 157,000+ subscribers on r4r and even if only 1% of those users fall into this category--which, statistically speaking, is conservative--that would make for a healthy user base. Doesn't hurt to try.

I got a 3 on the Schirmer test after visiting the opthamologist the other day for dry eyes. My eyes were at their typical wetness that day. She asked me if I had a history of taking Accutane as a teenager and I told her yes. When she asked me this everything just clicked in my head. I have so many other unexplainable problems. E.g. chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. Had multiple prostate exams, prostate fluid checked, urine tests, cystoscopy, dilated urethra, CT exam for stones, everything negative. This has been going on since before my 22nd birthday. I also have had eczema since I was a pre teen. My eyes are terribly dry every day and when I wake up. My mouth is also dry but it is not nearly as bad as the dry eye. I took Accutane for probably a little less than 6 months when I was ~15-16 but I stopped it early. Trouble with memory/focusing. Depression on and off since age 19. Anxiety my whole life. Just now learning to control it. Random joint pain in right femoral head when I step with my right leg sometimes. Hips, knees, shoulders sometimes crack. 

TMJ syndrome (My jaw used to catch when I was about 12-14. I would open my mouth and it would catch on itself and be very painful. That finally stopped but lately it has been popping like my shoulders and knees). Should I see a rheumatologist?

Have tried Fish oil for 2 weeks and it doesn't seem to do anything.
However I've found combining saw palmetto and cranberry extract helps with the prostatitis (for anyone looking! - 150 mg morning and night of saw palmetto. )",1522580573.0

I manage Sjögren’s with Plaquenil, but have had to cease using anti-inflammatories due to interactions with other medications I take. My most pressing presenting symptoms are dry mouth, dry eyes, fatigue, and most troublesome, rheumatic pain in my hands, feet, knees, and shoulders. 

I attempt to be active, and would consider myself to be in “fair” physical health. I have been much less motivated to go to the gym regularly lately, though, because I’m finding that routines that used to work for me are causing me too much pain to sustain an effective number of repetitions and sets. I am wondering if anyone out there has experience with gym routines and Sjögren’s, or just staying physically active in general while managing the disorder. 

Ideally 3-4 times a week, I try to do ~30 minutes of cardio (elliptical, stair stepper, jump-roping seem to be the most doable), and like to do moderate strength training and toning (usually using cables/machines, as free weights often cause too much pain in my hands). My fitness goals are fairly modest— I’m not looking to bulk up into a body builder or anything, just trying to stay in shape, keep my heart healthy, and ward off the fatigue that often follows sustained periods of inactivity. 

I’ve tried consulting my rheumatologist (who is never very interested in answering my questions), as well as personal trainers at my gym (who have been incredibly responsive and compassionate, but just don’t know enough about the disorder to really help). Is there some resource I might be missing (physical therapist?), or does this just come down to trial and error?

I'm in some desperate need of some help and direction on what I'm going through at the moment.  My health/mental health and life is in shambles right now, and I am about 100% sure I am suffering from autoimmune disease. Let me preface that I am female and just turned 30 years old back in January. Also, this probably will be a lengthy post, as this has been an ongoing struggle.

First off, I am not sure which auto immune disease, however, I am suspecting Lupus, Hashimoto's, or Sjogren's. My symptoms include: neck stiffness, neck pain, particularly under my jaw and under where my ears connect, sometimes the pain is severe, sometimes it's a nagging type of pain, also it is usually accompanied by heat and a burning sensation, in which my face and neck area will get hot, to the point I have to splash water on my face or press something cold. My face stays red, which people comment on, however, I am also pale and have freckles, I have redness on many areas of my body. I also get a low grade fever that accompanies this. I am also experiencing joint stiffness in my hands, feet, and one of elbows. The joint stiffness is mostly in my finger joints and toe joints, particularly when I am laying down for bed. Also, when I I lay down to bed, I am experiencing horrible calf and foot cramps, and man they are annoying and painful! The cramps are more recent and more frequent. I am having some stomach issues, as well. For example, I used to have a very normal bowel movements and solid, but I'm now experiencing constipation issues and a tugging feeling or full on my right side. I also previously suffered from debilitating menstrual periods. I once had a period last nearly 5 months, another for 3 months. Until recently I battled through this for years and years, with no luck. I am now on Nuva Ring and so far, they are controlled and normal. I am also having skin issues, which I believe to be from a compromised immune system. I ended up in the ER last year with swollen, red, itchy, and painful calves and feet. The  ER doctor (who was an absolute nightmare) said it was cellutis and gave me nothing and did nothing, sent me home after my bloodwork came back normal. OH, how could I almost forget..the horrendously dry skin! I have always been on the dry side, but damn, my skin is a desert! I also exfoliate like crazy..so much skin! These are most of my physical symptoms, although, I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. 

I am also experiencing (feel like I have typed that word 100 times just in this post, sorry) mental health problems, which I have dealt with since my early teens, but nothing has been done till recently, which leaves me where I'm at now. Last year, I finally found a wonderful, yet expensive GYN and have had bloodwork, pap smear, and vaginal ultrasounds performed. Everything has come back clear  (including all past paps). I was for certain that everything I have been slowly dealing with and accumulating was stemming from gynecological issues, now I am not. I am seeing a new GP and had more routine bloodwork done last week and was given Paxil and Atenolol, my BP was high. Before this past year, I have not had a steady GP, only a GYN. I have told  my GP my issues, but what do I specifically need to do? I also do NOT have insurance, my boyfriend/fiancé of 10 years is pretty much taking care of the both of us, as things have hit such a head that I am unable to work and have put grad school on hold. I honestly feel like my entire life has been on hold, as I am also avoiding friends, family, and unable to even hardly leave the house.

It seemed like no matter how much she slept she could not get over it. She lived with it for a little bit but then started noticing that she had swollen lymph nodes on her neck.  She didn't have a primary doctor at the time so she just got one that seemed close and had a few positive reviews.  The doctor was a nightmare.  Basically passed her off to a surgeon who biopsied the lymph nodes but couldn't find anything. Basically both of them said her problems were in her head.  At this point though, she started having extreme stomach pain. Especially if she ate certain foods.

She got a recommendation from a friend to go see a gastroenterologist who recommended she go to a rheumatologist (at first was gonna make her wait 2 months before seeing her but got lucky and there was a cancellation) . That person then asked her if she had gotten a lot of cavities lately.  She had just started going to the dentist this year after a long period of having no dental insurance. She had 10 cavities.... With this info, the doctor decided she probably had Sjogrens.They did the tests but made her wait a month before discussing the results. In the meantime they got her on those anti malarial drugs and the anti dryness drug.  

Well during that time, the gastroenterologist finally got her in to do a endoscopy. They found that she had h. pylori.  She had been tested a couple of times prior (i forgot to mention) but no one had found it those times.  

Then just last week after all this waiting and jumping around from doctor to doctor, they finally gave her the verdict that she indeed has SSA + Sjogrens.  Although the doctor was great in diagnosing her, they didn't really give her any advice or comfort, they just gave her a print out from that Sjogrens foundation site and sent her on her way.

&nbsp;

I think MMP9 is the link between the pathologies, and I believe MMP9 dysregulation can be accomplished by a variety of pathogens, injuries and possibly drugs, and is the cornerstone of Sjogren's dysregulation. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818099 (among many others, and all links hereafter just to illustrate the point, not be a definitive study - I'm not going to footnote every article that got me here).  

I don't believe MMP9 causes RA, Atherosclerosis or Depression, but it may be what activates these diseases for Sjogren's patients (i.e. a variety of causes for those diseases).  I believe MMP9 starts the inflammatory cascade that results in the substantial dysregulation of the immune system (increased IL-6, increased CRP, increased BAFF, increased CXCL5, b12 deficiency, decreased Mucin production, etc) which result in salivary and acinar glad destruction.

&nbsp;

The main phenotype for Sjogren's is post-menopausal women; I propose for this cohort it is Estrogen reduction that results in persistent MMP9 elevation, as Estrogen represses MMP9 activation.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668239  Vitamin D deficiency also elevates MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12454321 so Vitamin D-deficient, post-menopausal women might be doubling-down.  A high-fat diet also increases MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935427 so it could be that any combination that brings MMP9 levels above a critical point induces the persistent dysregulation found in Sjogren's.  All 3 combined would be fairly common among American women.

&nbsp;


In my wife's case, she is Vitamin D deficient but not post-menopausal; she only has oral mucosal involvement with no ocular presentation really.  Enamel defects that leave her susceptible to cavities and periodontitis; for her I propose P. Gingivalis which upregulates and cleaves MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939075/.  P. Gingivalis also rewires Toll-Like Receptor responses, leading to neutrophils stuck in an inflammatory state: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4071223/, and P. Gingivalis neutrophils are impervious to IL-10 induced apoptosis, allowing them to survive longer: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308905/pdf/0650.pdf In addition, P. Gingivalis-primed macrophages promote Tolerance mechanism, unlike naive or tnf-a co-stimulated: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158629

&nbsp;


For non-post-menopausal, with involvement in ocular (and/or oral presentation) I propose HSV1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873454 
or P. Aeruginosa https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16384971

I'd be very curious to hear from any researchers or doctors out there.

My opthamologist has up to now been resistant to prescribing steroids unless they were really necessary, but I have an appointment soon and I’d like to get a prescription for one on file so that the next time I have an inflammation I can use it without fighting my way through the hospital emergency room only to be inspected by the ophthalmologist who inevitably prescribes me a steroid. 

What should I ask for? The steroids I’ve used up to now were Tobradex (Tobramycin/Dexamtehasone) because at that point my eye was both super inflamed and infected, and FML (Fluorometholone). I’m biased towards Dexamtehasone because it works pretty much the next day, but I know it’s really bad in terms of side effects. FML I’m not the biggest fan of because although it works I takes longer to start working and I have to put it in 4 times a day. I’ve never had any increased intraocular pressure from any steroids.

Advice please? I’m 20 and male btw

As a side note, anyone’s eyes made ALOT worse by lack of sleep? It’s now 3 times that I’ve only gotten a couple of hours of sleep and I’ve woken up with steroid required  inflammations.",1510114918.0

I have dry eyes, to be exact inflammatory dry eye. What I mean by this is that the dryness I have sometimes leads to some nasty corneal inflammation that needs steroids. Before this was the only issue I had, but recently a couple of other things have emerged. I used to take some meds that causes dry mouth and the dry mouth was always kind of mild, but now if I take a medication that has dry mouth as a side effect my mouth turns into the Sahara desert, it’s like sand. Also I developed eczema around two years ago that’s now gotten a bit worse, and also I now get pain in my knees and hips if I don’t move for a little bit, my fingers are also super stiff and hurt, cracking them relieves it a bit but not always.

I had a blood test and ANA was negative, but that was 4 years ago. Other than ANA, what else can I get tested that might help? My ophthalmologist recommended to other bloods tests (can’t remmebr the names which is a real bitch) that might help, since he suspected Sjogrens again after the eczema surfaced and now again since it’s gotten worse. 

So what other tests can I get done?

First off, I'm very grateful to have a community such as this one and the other Sjogren's communities online. They give me a lot of personal strength as I struggle with my own so-far mild conditions of the disease. 

I'm a 31 year-old male and I was diagnosed with a blood test about 3 months ago after having chronically swollen parotid glands and migratory joint pain that has worsened over the past year. I've also had the random bout of fatigue but always chalked it up to odd one-day fevers. 

In any case, my rheumatologist has told me that my symptoms are not too bad. He's recommended that I check up with him every 6 months for more blood tests, but hasn't put me on any medication since I seem more-or-less okay to him, managing symptoms as they come. For the most part, symptoms are gradually worsening though and I'm finding myself relying more and more on ibuprofen to deal with joint pain that sporadically arises throughout the day. I've already got an appointment with the doc, but the whole situation has gotten me thinking about long-term drug effects. 

Does anyone in this community have worries about long-term effects such as GI ulcers or kidney failure? I haven't researched too many other auto-immune drugs, but I'm sure they have a plethora of problems associated with long term usage, too. Are you guys and gals as paranoid about this as much as me? I'm definitely going to talk this through with my doctor, but sometimes I feel like he's reciting from a textbook when talking to me and I often like to hear the human side of things.",1508225962.0

I've had an ER visit once a year for the past three years due to extreme chest pain right at my solar plexus and radiating to my back. I thought it was pancreatic pain based on my internet research. After reading comments here, I believe they were ""flare ups"".  After each ER visit, they would run all the blood tests, ultrasound, etc. Never finding anything, until this year.

Back up a year... during my annual physical, one of the Sjogren's markers was positive.  My doctor said don't worry we'll check it again in 6 months to a year.  Fast forward a few months to this past January 2017.  I went to the ER again for my pains.  This time, they did find that both my liver and spleen were enlarged. I was referred to a GI specialist.

All of my blood work came back okay, but they did another ultrasound showing that my liver and spleen were still enlarged, this was in April 2017.  Since my blood was okay, they said improve your diet, don't drink any alcohol at all and we'll test again in October.

This past week, I had another annual exam with my General Practitioner.  I found out two days ago that two markers are showing up now for Sjogrens, and I also have markers SGOT, SGPT that are high indicating a problem with my liver.  By the way, I have completely stopped drinking and improved my diet, I expected my liver to go back to normal :(  I have another ultrasound to check my GI stuff next week.

Right now, I'm waiting for a call from my referral to my rheumatologist.  I had a cold a couple of weeks ago, my throat is still sore!  Every morning I wake up it almost hurts to close my mouth it's so dry.

Also, to add to the Sjogren's dryness, I have chronic migraines.  I finally got those under control with Amitryptaline that was prescribed by my neurologist.   Sadly, one of its side effects is dry mouth... I imagine I will have to stop taking it.

Not sure the purpose of my post.  I appreciate everyone that took the time to read it.  I just really hope that medications improve my quality of life and I hope I can reverse some of the damage that this disease has done to my spleen and liver.

It's done this before, about 5 years ago, and without really thinking about it, it seemed to heal on its own or I stopped noticing it. It has come back with a vengeance to the point that I'm not able to get new glasses because the blurring is so bad.  I assume at this point that I'll never wear contacts again.

I've been dealing with the eye problem for about a year. I've also had unusual symptoms of excess salivation and unusual taste in mouth for about a year and a half and also constipation and very dry bowel movements. The excess salivation may have been caused by excess catecholamine production due to intermittent fasting I've been doing. I've since stopped intermittent (one meal a day) fasting so I'll see if that goes away and my mouth becomes dry. The fasting can also influence lympocytes so it is possible my test may have been effected. I was doing the fasting to help with brain fog and fatigue that often happens after eating. I am also cold all the time unless the temperature gets above 80 degrees. This started more recently a few months ago.

I may also be having problems with my throat which just started. I don't seem to have a problem swallowing but I am getting some random sharp sensations in my throat that has been going on for about a month.

Defecation can be painful and there is often a lot of blood on the toilet paper and sometimes in the water. The unusual thing is that when I wipe there is normally nothing on the toilet paper at all which is not has it has been all my life. This clean wiping thing has been like that for over a year. Some time after that the pain and blood started. I wonder if my body is not producing mucin in the digestive tract. I've told my primary care physician about all these problems. He referred me to an ophthalmologist and they had no idea what was causing the eye problem. 

I've also had fibromylagia, for  over 10 years which includes jaw and neck pain and a lot of other pain and unusual neurological sensations and too many other symptoms to go into here. These sensations feel like numbness below the eyes and wet water sensations in the legs or other places. I also have ringing in the ears.

I had a metal wire fixed retainer made of stainless steel put in my mouth about 15 years ago when the health problems started. I just recently realized that the nickel in there could cause an immune problem causing fibromyalgia and other problems so I had it removed about a month ago. I'll see if any of my problems go away.

491,Disability Themed Short Story Anthology Call for Submissions,4,6obmz6,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/6obmz6/disability_themed_short_story_anthology_call_for/,0,"Hello Everyone,


I am a current undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University, and I have cerebral palsy. With the help of various staff members, I am compiling a short story anthology that will exclusively feature short stories written by people with disabilities. All of the stories will feature disabled main characters.


I am accepting submissions until October 1st. Responses to submissions will be sent out in November. The anthology will be published as a free e-book in March 2018.


All submissions should adhere to the following guidelines:


• The story’s protagonist must have a disability. The term ""disability"" encompasses anyone with a physical, mental, emotional, cognitive, or sensory impairment that significantly affects one or more major life functions. 

• Only disabled individuals who are 16 years old or older may submit. 

• Stories must be between 500 and 7500 words. 

• Each story’s content should be appropriate for readers 13 years old and older. It’s fine to have some violence and/or swearing, but it shouldn’t be gratuitous. 

• All genres of stories except for erotica will be considered. 

• Reprints are fine, although previously unpublished stories are preferred. 

• Simultaneous submissions are fine, but writers should let us know if their submission is accepted elsewhere. 

• The short story should be in Times New Roman 12-point font, double-spaced.


Submissions should be sent to disabilitysubmissions@gmail.com as Word attachments. Each author may only submit one short story for consideration.


The email should also include the writer’s complete contact information, a brief third person biography, and information about their disability.


Writers will be paid $30 for the one-time non-exclusive right to publish their story in the anthology. Writers will be paid shortly after the anthology is published.

I've been lurking here for a while as my girlfriend has this condition for a couple of years. Apparently she is in remission however she is starting to have dry eyes that's impacting her daily life severely.

She is an active lady who loves biking and all things outdoors. She recently rode a 20k fun ride and had to use swimming goggles (prescription) to keep her eyes from drying up. While it worked, it fogged up quickly so we're on a hunt for double-walled/anti-fog goggles.

Her current management method is the following:
1. Plaquenil (taking since April 2015 recommended by her rheum)
2. Daily omega 3 supplements (about 2 weeks now, recommended by optometrist)
3. Combination of Systane and Theratears preservative free drops (now taking 5-7 times daily)
4. Lowered brightness and put on warmer colours on monitors, red light filter on phones
5. Air humidifier in the bedroom

Dry eye symptoms seem to be getting worse but she found option #3 from you guys here which works really well for a limited time (thank YOU!).

Wanted to ask /r/Sjogrens for input on suggestions for further management. Thanks everyone!",1499220536.0

My sjogrens started during my benzo withdrawal; I have been clean 1 year.  With the best of my ability I am mostly convinced sjogrens stems from the gut, ( leaky gut syndrome and the like) and I have been following the protocol. That being said I've only seen a slight decrease in symptoms ( although I do feel healthier).

Here are some of my beliefs. Does anyone want to agree or refute them?

1. Gut damage (villi inflammation and separation) can let excessive foreign bodies into the bloodstream and cause high demand on immune system. ""Foreign bodies"" my consist of undigested food particles, toxins, or undigestible parts of food that normally pass through such as insoluble fibers. Immune system ""tags"" foreign invaders and will attack them no matter where they end up I.e. The gut, joint capsules, salivary glands.

2. Immune system (macrophages) will damage body tissues in order to get to the foreign invader that is housed in the salivary glands, oil glands, or joints. 

3. Excess physical, chemical, or emotional stress wears down the immune system so those  can cause or worse symptoms

Eye doc recommended scleral lenses because they're rigid and formed such that they trap a layer of sterile saline between the contact and the eye rather than wicking away moisture like soft contacts. So I took the plunge. Thoughts:

Been wearing them for a few months now. I can usually go a full day wearing the scleral lenses (14 hrs is pushing it), but if not I can take out and ""reset"" with a new bubble of saline. They're much more comfortable and my vision is way more stable. I still get a lot of protein buildup on the lenses by the end of the day, but the cleaners they make for this seem to be doing the job ok.

Cost wise, they were expensive - $700 for the pair, including astigmatism. Plus my doc's additional ""fitting"" appointment cost. As my prescription is stable, they should last me several years. My vision is bad, so my soft lenses were already custom and not super cheap - $80/3 months. After 2-3 years the scleral lenses become more cost effective for me, assuming I don't lose or break them.

Last thing to note is that my dry eye is probably moderate. I'm on restasis and use gel eye drops at night (probably switching to an ointment soon though) but I haven't needed to top off during the day because of the layer of saline the contacts trap against the eye. 

Hopefully this was helpful for anyone else still hoping to use contacts.",1493890043.0

520,Many Sjogren's Symptoms; Many Possible Causes. Need Help Untangling the Web.,5,5rsjc2,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/5rsjc2/many_sjogrens_symptoms_many_possible_causes_need/,9,"Hi all.  I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.  First let me say I know nobody can diagnose me here and that I plan to consult a doctor soon.  I'm just trying to calm my anxiety until then and sort out what to say when I *do* get in :)

______________________________________________

Background:  I'm 31, have suffered chronic fatigue since I got my period at age 12 (though it's much better when I'm taking birth control pills) & am experiencing progressive dryness throughout my body for the past decade or so.  

**EYES**

When I moved to the desert 10 years ago, my eyes began to have these ""flare ups"" where they would feel like they were full of sand.  I couldn't see anything and would rub them incessantly (bad, I know) for days until it would go away.  They would swell up and look like I had been hit in the face.  No amount of moisturizing drops would help.  It was terrible!  I assumed it was because my contacts were irritating my eyes, but it persisted to a degree even after having LASIK.  (When I had the LASIK, my eye doctor was struck by just how dry my eyes were.  He put in punctal plugs, aka tear duct plugs to help keep the moisture in.  That has helped tremendously but, *boy*, was it unpleasant to have those 8"" needles going into my eyes)!  :O

**TEETH**

In the last 6-7 years or so, I've started to develop cavities along the gumline of my back teeth despite brushing daily and flossing regularly.  My mouth is often bone dry despite using Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash and drinking tons of water.  These cavities seem to spread much faster than the kind that form on the top of the teeth, causing me to require several extractions.  I never used to get these gumline cavities in the past until about 7 years ago; now they're the only kind I get.  I do eat a lot of sweets as a side effect of my medication, so I'm sure that contributes somewhat.  

**SKIN**

In the last 2-3 years, my scalp has become incredibly dry as well.  It was always oily due to my super-fine and oily hair, but now it's dry and full of large dandruff flakes.  My hair stylist actually thought the dandruff was lice until I explained that it wasn't.  I've never been so humiliated!  Aargh!  

**OTHER SYMPTOMS**

During this 7-10 year time frame, a few other worrying symptoms have cropped up.  Vaginal dryness being one of them, but also total loss of sex drive (due to vaginal dryness? Or not?  I'm not sure).  My abdomen has become bloated and I've gained weight I can't seem to lose no matter what I do.  And I've always had ""irritable bladder"" aka burning caused by certain substances like caffeine & not drinking enough water.  All my blood tests & routine checkups come out normal.      

**POSSIBLE CAUSES**

I know these sound like definite Sjogren's symptoms, and maybe they are, but there are some other things that could be muddying the waters.  

First, I live in a desert climate that is sunny 360 days a year and gets about 1/2 inch of rain per year...if that.  Summer temps get to 120 degrees regularly.  In short, it's hot and dry here, unlike the place I grew up.  Some of these symptoms began when I moved here, such as the dry eye flare ups.

Secondly, I take a lot of medications that can cause dryness as a side effect.  Here are just a few that come to mind:  dicyclomine, oxycodone, propylhexedrine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine succinate, cannabis & Prozac.  Most of these are taken daily or semi-daily for medical conditions.

______________________________________________

I know everyone's symptoms are somewhat different, but how much of this resonates with you Sjogren's folks?  Did your symptoms set in over a long period, or did you just wake up with the disease?  Do you think it could be the medications and desert climate causing my symptoms, or is it likely something more serious?  I just don't know what to think anymore.

I have Psoriasis. And felt i was getting arthritis. i just had a basic blood work panel done last feb. so i asked my dr to test me for RA.  along with other stuff just everything if you could. He did another full blood work round.  Everything was normal minus the below (feel free to play dr like i do) It's highly encouraged.. So of course i google the not so normal results.. and i'm here so clearly i think i'm going to get the news tomorrow that I have SS.  Mainly more so than the jokes of playing dr. I really tend to get put on the spot and draw a blank. And end up googling what i could of talk to a dr about!   so I'm coming here first with what should I expect with results like this and any other questions to ask the dr if i do end up with this. 


Play dr.. (What do I have from my blood work?) (also please more than anything help me with questions to ask dr)

RHEUMATOID FACTOR  normal range. 

ANA test Positive  pattern: 	Homogeneous  

SSB/La Ab	49 UNITS in the Sjogrens antibodies 
so that's higher than the normal/average. 

Everything else is in range. these are the only scores that scored out of range. 
Will i need more testing? What should I expect


Also i really don't know much about it. 
I have tears they come all the time. and my mouth is only dry when i smoke weed. my eyes do tend to burn a lot. sort of use to it tho. however the one thing i can relate to is the extreme tired ness ALL DAY EVERY DAY. 
I don't want to down play or up play. but i'm really wanting to know how bad is this Sjogrens disease? 
will i need to be disabled do i have to quit work (one day clearly today won't happen i'm functioning fine) 

Are their other test i will need to get?

forgive me for being all over the place. it's sort of my thing. ;)

At that point I went to my doctor, told her my symptoms and she did blood work for auto immune disorders. Sjogren's came back negative. And since my only symptoms were dry eyes and mouth she said it was most likely just the dry winter air and sent me to my eye doctor for some symptom relief. At that point I was pretty relieved.

But winter came and went and my symptoms only got worse. Eventually I started to experience dryness in ""other"" areas as well, if you catch my drift. And that has made certain activities often painful. I'm not sure what to do at this point. My blood test was negative but from what I've read, 20% of people with Sjogren's have negative tests.

A seperate primary care doctor Blood test showed extreme loss of vitamin deficiency that included low iron. I took centrums daily, lots of water but no effect. Constant burning eyes, fatigue, and dry cotton mouth daily, and mysterious blisters on my feet and palms. A couple of months ago i had inguinal hernia (laproscopic) surgery.  The doc said i had ALOT of intestinal scarring down there. I had bloating, constipation, and trouble burping and bloating. 

Two months later, one day i pushed really really hard in an upwards motion against the pelvic bottom of my intestines ( with my right hand against the right side) hard against the belly skin (2 inches below my belly button) and i could feel my bottom intestines come free from a lower pelvic pocket of muscle. It made a loud squishy gas sound. The Sjogrens disappeared, and constipation as well. 

I realized my Sjogrens was caused by a lower intestinal constriction on that right side right above the pelvic bone. I had loosened it!! My skin psoriasis dissappeared and no more dry mouth/eyes, and chronic fatigue is gone! 

Sjogrens free ever since.
Hope this helps you out. 


Also:
I pushed about 2-3 inches lower (and more left as facing the pic) than the guy in the pic.

Also:  if Sjogrens goes away, it can come back, especially if you strain on toilet, do heavy lifting, or sneeze hard too often.  had to push the intestines up again so it doesnt get stuck caught in the pelvic muscle. Ischemia of intestines caused mine too.

Optometrist gave me an eye exam and gave me two eye drops saying everything was fine except my eyes were probably dry and in need of rest and that oil in the eye was causing some vision blur.

I was okay for a while until I started getting some symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, brain fog, mild heat flashes, mild headaches, dry mouth and more vision problems(floater in right eye). I then started getting IBS like symptoms like random abdominal pain and some bouts of watery stools/diarrhea. 

I went back to the US and started taking some multivitamins prior to this and during my whole time in the states, my dry mouth was completely GONE.  Some symptoms still persisted and my vision was still a lil weird. I took myself BACK to taiwan bc of the diarrhea persisting and now I'm currently undergoing some tests. Awaiting results for ANA/ENA, SED, some other things. Was tested negative for celiac Iga, h pylori, HIV, and my previous tests prior to leaving taiwan like CBC, homocystein, iron/tibc(?), all came back fine, though I was vitD deficient.

I grew up around some great friends, not to mention were (and still are) very athletic. I often wondered why I was always short of breath when doing the simplest tasks, but accepted that I was simply born smaller than everyone else.

Fast forward to college. I was exposed to more stress and exhibited a drastic weight loss. For years, I had discoloration on my skin and I rarely went out in the sun unprotected. An extremely good day for me would be a day where I had no commitments. A commitment as simple as going to lunch exhausted me. I've always thought there was something wrong with me. Friends would always mistake my exhaustion as disinterest. The truth is, simply sitting in a chair feels exhausting and made my heart palpitate. I ignored this for some time.

Fast forward another 3 years. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology and hopped right into a full-time career in Early Intervention Case Management. It was a stressful time, but to know that I transitioning into adulthood made me feel extremely fulfilled. 
Now with that being said, I thought, hey! Maybe I shouldn't see my pediatrician anymore since I'm 22....... 

I made my first appointment with a primary care physician who is also a pulmonologist. Took a bunch of exams: allergy, breathing, urine, blood, etc. Doctor looks at my results and notices I have a 42% breathing capacity. My blood test had an SS-a/Ro level of 8.0. My first response was no fucking way I've been alive for this long, I must be wolverine or some shit. Then I explained how I've always felt and how things are now: skin dehydrated to the core, ever-constant fatigue, white spots on my skin, no appetite, weight loss. His immediate intuition was to refer me to a rheumatologist, who did a more in-depth blood test and confirmed I have Sjögren's syndrome. I did a PFT/CPEX (pulmonary function test/cardiopulmonary exercise test) and the breathing capacity still came up around 40%. My doctor concluded that due to sjögren's, my lungs have hardened due to poor lubrication which resulted in scleroderma, which shows on my skin as well. 

It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, and I've been having such trouble finding the voice to be open about it. On the outside I'm really good at putting up a front as if I feel okay, and I don't want to constantly put it in everyone's face that I don't feel okay.. but I know that it would be of my utmost benefit to really put myself first.

I don't know how to explain to people that I don't want to drink for a while since I'm starting on plaquenil and trying a gluten-free/vegetarian diet. I might be the only one holding myself back. I just... don't know how to ask for support.

*I was waiting a long time for that appointment because the healthcare system in Ireland is in shambles. When I got to see the rheumatologist, they said I am ""prone"" to fibromyalgia, dismissed my persistently high ESR and CRP as ""normal"" and sent me packing.

*after complaining to the hospital about how woeful that appointment was, I received a new appointment for a second opinion. The second rheumy was lovely. Very helpful and keen to get to the bottom of the issue.
*He said he thinks that I have Sjogren's syndrome. I am inclined to agree - lots of my symptoms that were never explained by fibromyalgia are explained by the diagnosis of SS. 

*Nothing's definite yet. more tests need to be done. But its so odd having a potential diagnosis when you've been floating through uncertainty for years. It's weird looking back on things that have happened (my tongue and glands randomly swelling, for example, and having a fever with no other symptoms) and thinking ""well shit, that could be caused by Sjogren's.""

I've been dealing with unusual neurological symptoms since I was 19. I'm 25 now. The first thing that happened was that I began to struggle with erectile dysfunction... weird for such a young age. Then I started to notice a change in my urination habits. I was either urinating too frequently or not enough, depending on the day. Urologist said the issue was a pelvic floor dysfunction. 

Soon after I started to get tingly numbness in my thighs and later lost all feeling in my big toes. I was diagnosed with long-fiber peripheral neuropathy and had multiple neurologists clear me for MS and tell me ""as long as it's not painful, it's no big deal."" I've had neuropathy symptoms for three years now and believe that my bladder problems are a combination of that and stress/anxiety.

Eventually I sought a second opinion from a neurologist who decided to test for autoimmune involvement. All blood tests came back negative: negative ANA, normal sed rate, no RF... *except* I apparently have a very small number of anti-SSA antibodies. Doc said this was really weird to have them and no other abnormal bloodwork. The way the measurement worked for these labs, over 40 meant positive for anti-SSA, and my value was 49. He said that was positive for sure, but that people with Sjogrens would have more like 100 on that scale. But googling ""anti-SSA"" seems to indicate that if you have the antibodies at all, you 100% have or will have a disease, so I'm freaking out. 

Also, I'm having flashbacks to three years ago when my urologist noted trace protein in my urine but said it was probably nothing. Could this be some weird autoimmune disorder attacking only my kidneys and nerves in my feet? My most recent urinalysis also had trace protein but that was considered normal and my BUN was normal.

I have been seeing various eye doctors and opticians for the last five years (am now 26). I need eye drops about 20-30 times a day, depending on activity, how well I slept,etc.. This eventually led to a lip biopsy, which came back positive. My first reumatologist meeting is next week, what are some good points to bring up? I don't want to seem too needy or overdramatic, but I do want this to be taken seriously. 

I've been told to ask about B12 deficiency, and pilocarpine hydrochloride. Anything else that would be good to bring up?

I noticed this after having slept with a fan blowing in my direction for just under a week, but the dry throat persists. Throughout the day it comes and goes and I've had trouble swallowing on occasion. Even breathing makes my throat feel awful and dry. That said, I don't have trouble producing saliva when I'm eating or anything. I also don't experience pain when swallowing.

Another possible symptom is that in the past few months, on some days I've been waking up with a stinging sensation in my eyes that lasts a couple minutes and eventually goes. When they sting I just close my eyes really tight, waiting for it to pass, and some tears form. Other than that I haven't felt like my eyes were particularly dry and I don't experience the stinging any other time during the day.

The only other thing is that a couple months ago I noticed a painless, pea-sized bump in front of my ear where the parotid gland would be. It was there a couple of weeks or so and disappeared but I didn't have any of the dry throat symptoms. 

I understand I can't be diagnosed here, but I'm just wondering if the degree of my symptoms could indicate sjogrens, or would the dry throat be much worse (e.g. not producing much saliva when chewing)? ",1472060067.0

It's not awful, but gradually getting a little worse, and it definitely is inflamed interfering with vision.  

I've also had dry mouth for several years.  It may be related to using a CPAP, but I do use an attached humidifier.  Still sometimes it gets so dry at night I have to peel my lips off my teeth using my fingers, and it gets dry way down my throat, past the tonsils.  During the day it's not too bad if I stay hydrated.  I use biotene paste and mouthwash per dentist.  Dentist has noticed I'm getting a lot of small cavities despite going in for cleanings every 4 months.

I am also diabetic about 8 yrs., on bydureon, invokana and metformin.  Simvistatin for preventive cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid (also about 10 yrs.)

I am getting a tiny bit of neuropathy in my feet (assumed it was diabetes).  I've also noticed big dry skin patches on my upper legs and torso that have gotten both larger and drier in the last couple of years, but I wrote that off to the diabetes as well.

Over the last six months I started getting an on-again, off-again muscle pain on the shoulder.  Endo tested vit D and found it extremely low, put me on 50,000 units weekly until it got back into the normal range, now it's monthly.  The arm muscle pain became less frequent and less intense after than (so I wrote that off to vitamin deficiency).

I have no gastro issues (yay!) and no flu-ish issues, although I do feel kind of run-down and tired (wrote that off to stress, laziness/lack of exercise).  

None of the doctors are talking to each other, so no one's put a picture together.  I have no single primary--instead, the Endo, dentist, and opthamologist.

I came across a post the other day elsewhere and started researching sjogren's when it had a much closer fit than I expected.

I'm now second-guessing everything, and wondering if this could be a fit for early presentation of SS?    So many people seem to have trouble with getting diagnosed, and I really am not having issues that aren't already being treated, so I'm wondering if I'm just over-reacting.

* Fatigue
* General muscle and joint aches
* Depression...because, honestly, who wouldn't be depressed after dealing with the list of shit above?

Listed out like that, it's a lot of stuff. Probably not all relevant, but figured it didn't hurt to put it all out there and get your thoughts. These are all things that I've seen individual doctors for, with varying rates of success/improvement.

I've had miscellaneous joint pain, dry mouth, and dry eye for over 10 years so this comes as a huge relief. That said, I'm still having a ton of joint pain and my dry eyes are becoming a huge problem despite my cocktail of drugs (plaquenil, exovac, and restasis). My rheumatologist said that he's going to try to get me into a clinical trial for a new drug they're developing for primary SS patients that he thinks is quite promising AND that the study will pay for extensive blood work not typically covered by insurance, a lip biopsy (to hopefully definitively make the diagnosis) and the drug, and I will be compensated for my time! I'm pretty much over the moon and I hope I qualify for the trial. 

Here's the question- What's your daily regimen in terms of managing the symptoms of your SS? Here's mine right now:

*Take exovac 3x day, plaquenil 2x, restasis 2x
*Use artificial tears throughout the day (I'm trying to shoot for every 2 hours)
*Try to drink a ton of water
*At night I put a hot towel over my eyes to help the dryness 
*At bedtime use Systane gel drops
*Use coconut oil as needed when I get vaginal dryness 
*Take NSAIDs when joint pain becomes to much to bear
*Wear sunscreen religiously and avoid sun exposure
*Take naps and rest frequently when I feel a flare coming on

My dry mouth and dry eye are still out of control though. Any thoughts? Does Biotene really help? What's your regimen?

Hi all,
Sorry if this is a TMI post but I'm hoping someone can help!  

Right now I have a dx of UCTD due to a host of nonspecific complaints (IBS, wrist pain, neck/back pain, morning stiffness, dry mouth) completely normal blood work with the exception of a very low complement 4. I was started on plaquenil 2 weeks ago and feel some relief from it. I'm having some side effects though- itchy skin (no rashes yet), extreme sensitivity to sun, and now I have this horrible burning sensation on my outer labia. I'm only 26 and I have had some issues with getting wet during intercourse previously, but this is next level. It feels like a chemical burn. It hurts so bad I can't even wear a panty liner or pad with it because it irritates it further. I have been tested previously and have no STIs and haven't had sex in over a month anyways. My Rheumy said that it's probably a yeast infection and unrelated to the plaquenil, so I have an appointment on Monday with my obgyn. But I've never had a yeast infection like this. No discharge, primary complaint is horrible burning/dryness/itching made worse by touching it. My mind is going two places though: could this be merely a symptom of sjrogens although not the typical presentation? Or a side effect of a generic version of plaquenil?  Anyone else have experiences like this with sjrogens? 

Update: All tests for yeast/bvi/stis came back negative. This is the 2nd time this has happened. I'm definitely concerned about Sjogrens and will bring it up with my rheumy next time I see him in August. :(",1461543039.0

I have been interested in this forum for some time now and wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts on what my concerns could be.

Gender: Male
Age :21
Ethnicity: Indian (SE Asian)
Smoking: No

Back in December (about 3 months ago) I had an episode of extreme dry mouth that lasted about 10 days.
The onset was about 2 days of feeling as though my mouth was drying out, not necessarily gradual worsening, then bam out of nowhere - almost complete inability to produce saliva.
On many of those 10 days I was unable to produce any saliva which dried out my throat and made it painful to sleep/swallow, I could not produce enough to eat, had drying lips, etc.,

It was dry mouth with no other symptoms - markedly, I did not feel dry eyes.

I saw two dentists, both who said that there was a small amount of saliva production when stimulated despite dryness and no swelling of the glands so that I should just wait it out.
I saw a physician who said it could be lingering effects of stress/viral infection and that I should increase my water intake and wait it out.
A few days later I was fine but I had developed a possibly unrelated jaw pain that I thought may have been TMJ but subsided.
That subsided in two weeks and then I was ""back to normal"", as far as I could tell.

Tuesday of last week I saw the symptoms come back when I thought they had gone away.
The symptoms weren't as severe as last time until suddenly last night it began to worsen.
Now I'm wondering if it was simply a much longer time of onset...

Reasons I believe I could have Sjorgen's

    Dry mouth symptoms
    Possible involvement of dry nose
    Immediate blood relative has auto immune disorder - sister has Vitiligo
    Could have been predicated by topical immiquimod disease
    Insidious nature of disease may mean these are just early warnings
    Others have shown that the symptoms can come and go and are highly personalized so fact that I don't have dry eyes may mean nothing

• Lot of other reasons, supposedly, that are bengin and better explain dry mouth only conditions

• Any suspicions of nasal symptoms or ocular symptoms are likely just confirmation bias

• Not likely to have based upon typical age group, gender, or ethnicity

• No inflammation of glands; does not improve with NSAID use and not palpable

• No ocular involvement

• Seems like it should be chronic, my symptoms are both acute and intermittent

• Could be due to seasonal changes

I have a lingering suspicion that this may all just be related to my impacted wisdom teeth but that's perhaps more hopeful than anything.

She's had SS for over 15 years, and 2 years ago noticed her right calf muscle had disappeared. She waited to see a doc until a month ago. The doc referred her to a Neuro muscular ortho(?) And after an EEG and MRI, nothing is conclusive. Now she's getting a spinal tap. 

But I just can't help but think it is SS related, and not back/spine (she had a slipped disc 18 years ago and had surgery top correct it, then a few years of chiropractor care...but she stopped the chiro 4 years ago... Then the muscle atrophy showed up)

I'm currently in the process of trying to get a diagnosis - I meet with my doctor on Wednesday to discuss bloodwork, and I assume he will refer me to a rheumatologist because I'm already seen my test results online. Positive ANA, positive Rheumatoid Factor, Positive anti-SSA Antibodies, etc. In the meantime I am assuming it is likely I have Sjogren's and at least have a lot of the symptoms, especially dry mouth, swollen salivary glands, and difficult swallowing.

Recently my sinus passages have been getting super dry (exacerbated by winter, I'm sure), and when I have post-nasal drip, I feel like the mucus is very thick and just sits in the back of my throat. I carry a 32 oz Nalgene with me and drink at least 3 of them a day so I'm constantly drinking water, and I've tried mucinex to loosen the mucus but it doesn't seem to do much. I also try to run my humidifier when I'm in my room and use a saline nasal spray.

My fatigue and fibro symptoms are pretty severe. This year I have developed a huge lump under my cheek bone. Symptomatic of an inflamed salivary gland. I did some research and found Sjogerns could be the cause. I remember complaining about 'small painful lumps' in my cheek to my doctor years back but thought nothing of it. (He didn't have anything to say about it either.)

I went to my doctor and asked her if I might have Sjogerns and she said no. I asked her if the huge lump on my face and all my fibro symptoms getting worse might be related and she said no. 

She said she thought the lump was in my skin and not my salivary gland (under the skin). But now I have developed a nice sized ulcer/canker type thing on the INSIDE of my mouth, on the SAME side as the lump on my cheek. Not to mention I feel the smaller salivary glands are inflamed in my cheek.

Now I'm not a doctor but these symptoms seem to be pointing to Sjogerns. Of course I could be wrong but I think it's important to rule out. I would really appreciate any advice. 

Here are the issues that lead me to believe I might have Sjogren's:

-Recurrent or persistently swollen salivary glands

-Numbness or tingling in the extremities

-Prolonged fatigue that interferes with daily life.

I was just diagnosed with Sjogrens yesterday, and after a lot of reading and understanding the problems it causes, so much is starting to make sense.

About six months ago, I was experiencing light sensitivity, almost like my eyes were dilated. I went to the optometrist, he looked at my eyes and immediately sent me to the ophthalmologist, where he found several hemorrhages in my right eye.

After undergoing a ton of blood tests, it turned out that I was positive for an autoimmune disease and was sent to a rheumatologist, where more tests were conducted. It was yesterday when he confirmed that I indeed have SS and was vitamin D deficient. 

My symptoms today are primarily dry eyes and mouth, and indigestion. 

I have intermittent joint pain in my knee, shoulders and elbow, but I don't know how much of that is due to normal body pains and what, if any, can be attributed to SS. None of it's so bad that it keeps me from exercising and taking my annual fitness test, however, and I'm in pretty good physical shape.

My biggest concern at this point is whether I'll be allowed to remain on active duty. My doctor prescribed me Plaquenil and Salagen, but in some of the research I read that others weren't able to deploy because of the medication. In some cases, the people were medically separated/retired due to SS.

It is something that really affects me now and I can no longer brush my teeth at night as I end up feeling sick from the skin going down my throat. I have gotten around this by just flossing and using mouth wash at night followed by a rinse of coconut oil, but toothpaste in general does irritate me and makes my mouth much dryer.

Things were going okay at first and I wasn't having any side effects, but about a week after I started taking it I began falling apart with awful stabbing shoulder pains, stabbing kidney pains, tachycardia, intense fatigue and frequent urination (more times a day than I can count and all through the night). Weirdly, I have had only minor GI problems and no nausea or dizziness (which I understand to be the most common side effects of Plaq). I decided to soldier through it and see if it went away. it didn't. 

I went to urgent care a few days ago and they did a urinalysis; it was clean. They told me I should just try to get into my rheumatologist earlier than the middle of December, when I'm scheduled to have my next appointment. I called up my rheumy's office yesterday and left a message for him. He called me back saying to just quit taking the Plaquenil (which btw I did several days ago, but maybe it takes time for it to leave your system) and just wait until my next appointment. He said he wouldn't prescribe me anything else at this point because all the other drugs are much less well-tolerated. He also said I should just go to my primary care doctor, who I know will tell me to go to my rheumatologist and send me away after 5 minutes. 

I'm just frustrated and depressed... I really had high hopes for Plaquenil and it seemed to me that so many people have had great results with it with almost no side effects. Of course, I can't be sure that it's the Plaquenil causing all of this, but I honestly really hope that it is, because if not it means I've developed some new chronic complications. So what next?

I am new to the group (and reddit as well)

My father likely has sjogren's (I say likely because there was no official confirmation but doctors said its probably is)

He is 51 years old and always been almost anal about being healthy. He picked off a piece of flesh under his tongue and got a saliva glad infection that caused his sjogren's to blossom in his mouth. 

It has been 3 months since the initial dr visit and it still is effecting his mouth. Luckily he has not complained of eye issues. 

Right now he is on Plaquenil, Xanex and takes countless saliva lozenges and gum to battle the dry mouth.

He has fallen into a depression, he doesn't even feel like getting out of bed somedays and is very fearful that he has to live with this, especially the constant lozenges and gum. He also has a tremendous amount of guilt thinking he caused this and it would never have happened if not for that one moment (I tell him not so since his mother had lupus and its genetic)

I want to help him as much as I can, I encourage him, I talk to him daily, but he still stays in his rut. I know, trust me I know this is not any kind of instant fix, its a long term thing that time will help with.

Does anyone have any suggestions, advice, anything for my father and myself who is supporting him through this?

I will be around and would love to get some supporting informations, tips.

613,Some scientific articles on SS and chronic illness,4,32wdwc,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/32wdwc/some_scientific_articles_on_ss_and_chronic_illness/,11,"Hi everyone, since learning that a dear friend of mine has pSS I've tried to use my skills as a researcher to better understand the disease, the variants, the outcomes, the whole she-bang.  I've accumulated quite a bit of knowledge and a decent number of scientific articles on relevant topics.  The whole reason I did this was because I thought the best way to help was to provide knowledge and dispel fear and then I thought, why not share that with as many people as can benefit from it?  So I wanted to share the articles I've downloaded so far in a [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2WMn56XoGCBfkVWcmdGQkRyOXctMDltUFdfcno0ZVR2azdYVmpEWUJra0tTZDlURUM1MUU&usp=sharing).  

As a neuroscientist myself, there is a special focus on central nervous system features in some of the articles but other important topics like efficacy of drugs and complications in pregnancy (which I'm relieved to say are quite minimal and controllable) are also scattered throughout.  

If you have any burning questions (or non-burning questions) about things on the research side or for clarification of something in an article (there is a lot of jargon), please feel free to ask here and I will tell you what I've discovered through my research or track down something that can and add it to the folder.  I hope people can find these useful!

EDIT: I updated the names of the articles to make it easier to find articles related to your questions",1429283048.0

However, what has, in your search for relief, been a true help to you and which symptoms did it help with? 
For me, I always use a humidifier in whatever room I am in. I like to have a lot of eyedrops handy and I'm a big fan of overnight eye moisturizer in tiny tubes. There are a few different brands but they all have the same basic ingredient.  
I also find that high pH water is very soothing to my mouth. I like 9 pH to 10 pH.",1429092055.0

A few months ago I went to pick up my prescription and instead of 20 dollars it was over 300, without insurance. The pharmacist told me his cost had jumped and he was giving it to me nearly at cost. Yikes! I called around and tried finding it somewhere else and everyone else was more expensive. Eventually I found Needy Meds a clearing house of sorts connecting patients with chairities providing low cost medications. I was able to get three months for 20 dollars, although they recently sent out a letter saying that due to cost increases they were increasing the cost to 20 a month. Anyway here's the link- http://www.needymeds.org/drug_list.taf?_function=name&=name&name=Plaquenil and I've added it to the sidebar.",1427706391.0

The joint pain is pretty horrible some evenings. My job has me on and off my feet and up and down stairs quite a bit. Before my dx I saw a physical therapist who said I have loose joints. So, my husband (and I) were wondering if knee braces would help with the pain by reducing inflammation-causing irritation when I'm active at work or exercising at home.

(+ANA Test and said I was asymptomatic anyway),3,30d4zk,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/30d4zk/does_this_sound_like_sjogrens_ana_test_and_said_i/,5,"So. Long story short this has been happening for close to 10 years now. They've pinned it on Vertigo Migraines caused by caffeine and discharged me. Now I can't fault that. That's cured the vertigo and dizziness but nothing else.

I still have postural hypotension (blacking out and collapsing (rarer now)). Still got tinnitus. Still get a funny taste in my mouth when ""blacking out"". 

Trouble swallowing (not noticed a dry mouth as such though).

Dry spit when I'm brushing my teeth? I thought this was just me. it still might be though. I'm never thirsty, ever. 

My lips are very dry. But equally I'm an avid lip biter but I've spent a fortune on balms and it's only ammonia based ones (Blistex) that seem to do anything and then a thick coating of Lanolin balms. 

Contacts are a nightmare for me. Always feels gritty and dry. I force through it and have drops. I still get them when I have glasses in but obviously much less. I physically can't cry with contacts in funnily enough. Just no tears come out. 

My memory is impossible. Non existent for anything long term. It's like being in a mental fog all the time.  

I've got clicky sore joints that I can't pin causes on. Well the knees are back from the falls, but I'm not willing to be on constant Naproxyn to get 50% relief. I've also got an annoying TMJD.

Don't sleep well. Constantly tired to some extent. Equally I can be working a physical job between 4am and ending at 11pm so my sleep pattern isn't perfect.  

My ANA test has always been 1:320. Never changed from about 6 years ago to a year ago. They just said it was asymptomatic. But with me always pestering about the vertigo and collapsing have I just steered them away from what it could actually be by downplaying or ignoring other symptoms. 

Funnily enough the thing that made me look at Sjorgrens again was getting contacts and the lady saying I have quite dry eyes which never occurred to me before. 

Soo yeah. I just don't have a clue. I'm going to try to get back into my GP over the next week but I'd love to know if I'm barking up the wrong tree and I'll happily lay it to rest and just carry on :)

Edited to add: I don't do heat. I spent 3 weeks in bed last summer. I couldn't physically move in the heat. I don't like anything about being out in it, which is more the pity since it's impossible to find makeup when I'm this pale! ",1427400865.0

For about 3 years now I've had extreme nausea the first two days of my period, accompanied with headache, fatigue, digestive issues. Many things have been tested and rules out, and IUD tried, and I'm currently on birth control where I won't have a period.

My doctor thinks I may have developed an extreme sensitivity to hormone changes in my late 20s. 

I realize this is the sjogrens subreddit- but I have so many things going on and I need all the help I can get. Any advice, personal stories, etc. Would be appreciated!!

She's 30, and we've been married 4 yrs.  the fatigue is the worst of it for her, I don't know where she is on the severity spectrum, if there is such a thing. All I know is that it has put a serious strain on our marriage, and I'm not sure how to set my expectations with her, and how to balance being tough and motivating with nuturing and forgiving.  She has had anxiety/depression since I've known her, and one thing is for sure, sometimes tough love is the only thing that can bring her out of a funk.  But now, I am the sole provider, I'm left with the lions share of household chores, and when she does get out of bed she seems to only be able to complain and be miserable.  I can't begin to understand what she feels like, but don't kid yourself...we all have our personal shit that we have to deal with.  Last spring I was in a bad accident and broke my pelvis, knee and jaw...I was really messed up.  But once I was done with surgeries, even when I didn't want to, and was hurting, I got back to work and life...really because I had no choice.  Everybody has adversity...sometimes I feel like she has just given up to her condition.  So my question is: how can I gauge my expectations of her with Sjogrens, and how can we manage to have any kind of fruitful relationship when Sjogrens rules her life?",1425774421.0

I had blurry, mildly dry eyes at my October appointment so she tested me for Sjogren's and my results came back normal (like all my others too, sigh).

In the last month my eyes have become increasingly blurry and dry, and now red and occasionally itchy, and I'm extremely sensitive to light now.  I drive a forklift and the wind from that makes it tough to drive (Plus I drive inside the cooler... cold, dry wind, yay!).  

Just in the last two weeks I've realized my mouth has become dry.  I wake up with cotton mouth and have to drink lots during the day To keep it from feeling gross.  I noticed last week my tooth enamel is wearing off, when I had my first mouth ulcer.  Joy.

I've also been struggling with a low-self-lubricating vagina for more than 5 years, but also in the last couple weeks I feel on the brink of a yeast infection.

And my skin all over is just soooo dryyyyy no matter how much I drink and moisturize.  It's like I just don't absorb any of the water I drink.

I had my doctor test my thyroid this week to make sure it wasn't just that and that came back normal as well (although when I looked at my results I noticed he didn't test properly according to /r/hypothyroidism).  But still, Im just feeling like I probably have Sjogren's. 

I plan to read the faq for the more obvious questions, but my other questions are!:  Will they retest me so soon after the negative result?  Is constipation/regular hard poop related to Sjogren's at all?  When I talk for too long, I get a painful lump in my throat - is that related as well?  And last, what in the world can you do for dry mouth overnight?! (Edit for one more!  Does anyone else get crazy muscle fatigue really easily?  I'll sometimes feel the burning in my muscles like I'm dehydrated after a marathon, just from like, vacuuming!  What the heck?)",1424649648.0

I just accidentally bumped the area near my collarbone and realized it was very tender, so I sort of felt around and realized the tenderness continued into my armpit, where there was also swelling, and around and under my breast as well. I'm sort of freaking out at the moment, as I'm not sure what can be attributed to Sjogren's and what i should actually be worried about. I'm supposed to get more lab work asap, as well as a chest X-ray. Would swollen lymph nodes affect either of those?

I find myself needing to use eye drops and saline nasal spray more during the day when I'm not at home. Dry eyes, dry mouth, dry sinus passages, dry skin... it's all worse since winter kicked into gear even with the Restasis and plaquenil.

This week I reached out to the facilities group at work to ask about having a humidifier at my desk (I work in a cube environment) and have to follow-up next week with the environmental hygienist. At home, I have a humidifier in the main living area and another in my bedroom. Investing in a [humidity monitor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BKDO8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) has helped me to be able to adjust the humidity to comfortable levels, even understand what those levels are. This week, it's been so bad at work that as soon as I get home, I boil a pan of water on the stove to get some relief.

I've learned that if I warm up my car really well in the mornings, use eye drops and nasal spray before walking out the door, and then turn off the heater on the way to work, that helps make the drive a little less miserable.

635,Starting the new year off with depression and other snowballing symptoms-Sorry ...Just a crazy rant because I can't sleep again.,8,2rahcb,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/2rahcb/starting_the_new_year_off_with_depression_and/,4,"I absolutely cannot take antidepressants ... They make me nuts and unstable.  I recognize that my depression is situational but what to do when the situation causing it is incurable?  

I was happy to see 2014 go.  I've spent way too much of that year either in bed or at the doctors.  It wasn't all bad.  I did get remarried... to the man of my dreams, my high school sweetheart who is forever patient and supportive even if my main issue is a bad mood.  I was eager to start 2015 and finding new ways to meet my goals of feeling better and being able to do more with my family and try to get back to work.  

Sjogrens sucks.  I never aim to spend my time in bed, but I always end up there.  I mopped my kitchen floor.  It desperately needed it and I couldn't stand feeling useless and it falling to my husband to come home from work only to have do what I can't.  It doesn't seem like much ... simply mopping a floor.  Who doesn't mop their kitchen floor?  With 4 little ones in the house it needs to be done daily but it often gets pushed aside.  Then I can hear my mother as if she's looking at my floor in disapproval saying ""I know you don't feel well but you need to just decide you're going to take care of your business and get it done"".  I love her but she sooo does not get it.  She likes to compare my fatigue with her staying up and hour or 2 later than usually because they had friends over for dinner.  I'd love to have friends over for dinner but not with my dirty kitchen floor!

I was determined to start the year with a clean kitchen floor.  It wore me out.  My shoulders swelled and ached. I can deal with that.  I got comfortable and tried to relax with the kids ... the feeling of having a clean kitchen floor beat the misery my body was in.  But then the back pain started.  It was bad.  I soaked in hot bath, took my pain meds and retreated to bed-only it didn't help and I couldn't sleep.  All of sudden at 4 am, I couldn't stop peeing.  3 trips to the bathroom in an hour each time with a bladder that felt like it would burst and on the 4th it hit me.  My urine had been getting darker and darker over that hour.  It didn't concern me at first because I drink a ton of water all day but all of a sudden I couldn't relieve myself.  The back pain instantly worsened and I thought I was going to throw up but then finally relief ... I was able to empty my bladder only to find blood clots had been blocking the flow.  The darkening of my urine was blood and the pain in my back from my kidneys.

Why would I attribute this to mopping my floor?  Because it happens every time I exert myself.  Only the last time I thoroughly cleaned my house, it was pancreatitis.  Before that it was pneumonia-twice.  And on 5 occasions in 2014, cleaning was immediately followed by shingles.  Not to mention the spontaneous bouts of lactation-that's right...I said lactation.  Only my youngest child is 5 and I've never breast fed so my breasts do not like lactating.  I became engorged and had to buy a breast pump and take antibiotics for a month.  My doctor was speechless.  

I have organ involvement and physical stress makes my immune system angry.  My recent marriage means my insurance has changed and now in the midst of new symptoms-potentially serious, I have no doctor.  Primary doesn't take my new insurance and my rheumatologist unexpectedly closed shop.  I will be out of pain meds by Monday and anyone whose dealt with chronic pain knows that look you get from a doctor who doesn't know you when you say you need a narcotic refill.  

Maybe 2015 will not be my year after all.  It's already adding up to be a year of tests - now including kidneys and undoubtedly, my temper.  I'll be 36 in 2 weeks and my 5 year old daughter is trying to buy my a ""pretty green"" (my favorite color) CANE for my birthday with her Christmas cash.  My kids deserve a better mom; my husband a better wife ... I need a new body and a better attitude.  Anyone know who has them on sale??  

In all seriousness,  I need a new outlet ... I would appreciate suggestions of what you do when you feel like you can't take anymore.  What leaves you feeling refreshed enough to keep pushing in the right direction? ",1420394784.0

Heh. Since I already have dry mouth, excessive thirst, muscular stiffness, and fatigue, I'm not sure how I'd know if I was experiencing negative results.

I had some coconut oil and figured I'd start small, like 5 minutes. As others had described, it wasn't exactly pleasant while I waited for it to melt in my mouth, but the swishing part wasn't bad at all. Soothing, even. I figure I'll try it for a while and see how it goes. Maybe it'll be like the [Neti Nasal Rinse](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=142205&catid=59915&aid=338666&aparam=142205&kpid=142205&CAWELAID=120142990000072055&CAGPSPN=pla&kpid=142205) in that once I got used to the ""weirdness"" of the practice, I really appreciated the benefits.

Anyway, if there's any interest, I'll let you know how it goes if I stick with it. Do you use oil pulling?

Even if it were for the pain alone, I'd hope to never experience shingles again, but it's also embarrassing to have a blistery rash across my face (though I had it on my torso as well) and every time I have to avoid contact with most of my family who are grown but have never had chicken pox and even avoid contact with our 5 children who have been vaccinated for chicken pox but their pediatrician says they can still get it from me (it would just hopefully be milder and shorter lived).

I woke Tuesday with sores inside my mouth, more to the front, but a general overall sensitivity going on, too. Today my lips are still really sore, to the point that smiling feels like it'll stretch and tear the tissue and the back of my tongue, inside cheeks at gum level is inflamed, really sensitive. 

In addition to the usual regime of Biotene rinse and a XyliMelts overnight to help relieve the mouth dryness, I started Rincinol rinse and H-B12 Melts to help with the sores. They're all OTC treatments.  I'm drinking plenty of water and just eating soft foods (chewing sucks). All this extra care has kept it from getting worse, but I don't think it's getting better. 

Little history: I was diagnosed with Sjogren's a couple months ago. Fibromyalgia a few months before that. I've been using Restasis for dry eye a couple months and that's improved. The rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil 2x daily for the mouth dryness which was so bad it was waking me in the night but not so bad I had mouth sores, till now. Before this week, that seemed to be improving somewhat.

Am I expecting results from the OTC products I've been using too quickly? Is this increase in dryness something I need to tell the dr? I was going to call the rheumatologist today but thought I'd see if anyone here had any suggestions of what helped them or anything specific I should ask the dr. Anything's appreciated - questions for the dr, products you use for relief. What helps you?

Edit: if you've read this far. Thank you. The NP had an opening this morning and I took it. She said since it's only been a couple days, if it stays this bad, call her next week. I called my dentist, who's a really nice guy, and he's going to check on some products that might provide relief.

But, to get a little more TMI. About 6 months before I started developing severe symptoms of lupus and sjogren's (the symptoms came over night, it seemed, and then a month later I was in the hospital), I went to the gynecologist to get a pap smear. I've had them before and they've always been a bit uncomfortable.

But this time, the literal walls of my vagina were stinging and burning when simply touched by the speculum. My provider said she had no idea what could cause that, and that there was nothing in the procedure that would cause stinging pain. I don't have any STDS, and I take yeast infection medication when needed.

Is it safe to say that what happened had to do with Sjogren's?

I'm taking Evoxac now, as needed, but now I'm a bit terrified. I haven't had any intimate relations, so I'm a bit worried that when that happens it'll be a repeat of my pap smear.

It will get better for a day maybe, then worse again. It's so bad right now that I am struggling to even keep my eyes open because they are so freaking dry. 

I'm going crazy folks. Any advice? 

Also, I thought I remembered my doctor giving me drops for this but he says there aren't any. Is he a lying poop face?! I can't function like this. 

Sorry for whinging. I have 4 auto-immune things and 2 other chronic illnesses and I this one is the most annoying, painful, horrible, evil one. ",1398681994.0

659,SS Awareness Month: Day 7 What causes Sjogren’s?,11,22jpkm,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/22jpkm/ss_awareness_month_day_7_what_causes_sjogrens/,0,"What causes Sjogren’s? The simple answer is there isn't a consensus on what causes SS. 

“Researchers think Sjögren’s syndrome is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Several different genes appear to be involved, but scientists are not certain exactly which ones are linked to the disease, because different genes seem to play a role in different people. For example, there is one gene that predisposes Caucasians to the disease. Other genes are linked to Sjögren’s syndrome in people of Japanese, Chinese, and African American descent. Simply having one of these genes will not cause a person to develop the disease. Some sort of trigger must activate the immune system.


Scientists think that the trigger may be a viral or bacterial infection. It might work like this: a person who has a Sjögren’s-associated gene gets a viral infection. The virus stimulates the immune system to act, but the gene alters the attack, sending fighter cells (lymphocytes) to the glands of the eyes and mouth. Once there, the lymphocytes attack healthy cells, causing the inflammation that damages the glands and keeps them from working properly. This is an example of autoimmunity. These fighter cells are supposed to die after their attack in a natural process called apoptosis, but in people with Sjögren’s syndrome, they continue to attack, causing further damage. Scientists think that resistance to apoptosis may be genetic.”

The average time between the onset of SS and a diagnosis is 4.7 years. Part of this delay is that there isn’t a single test that can confirm a diagnosis of SS and that it can appear differently in different patients. Instead doctors depend on several tests and a physical examination. Blood tests includes blood tests for ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody), RF (Rheumatoid Factor), SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La), IGs (Immunoglobulins) and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate). Ophthalmologic tests for SS include Schirmer Test to measures tear production and Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green Eyedrops to examine the surface of the eye for dry spots. Dental test for SS include salivary flow which measures the amount of saliva produced, the salivary scintigraphy which is a nuclear medicine test that measures salivary gland function and a salivary gland biopsy (usually in the lower lip) which confirms inflammatory cell (lymphocytic) infiltration of the minor salivary glands.

In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899-1986), an ophthalmologist in Jönköping, Sweden, observed a patient with low secretions from the lacrimal (which produce tears) and salivary (which produce saliva) glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca to describe the symptom of dry eyes (Keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, most of whom were postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 50 of whom also had arthritis. His subsequent follow-up conference trips pertaining to his paper led to an international interest in Sjogren’s syndrome.

Fatigue comes and goes usually on 3 months cycles and when its at its worse doing literally anything is too much and when its allright I try to exercise a few times a week by walking and running.

As I was talking about it to my massagist she recommended me on trying on L-Arginine as a supplemet. She said it's been helpfull for some of her other patients suffering from Sjögrens or similar disease.

Been using it for now a week and the difference on fatigue levels or overall physical performance of surviving a day is immense. I'm currently on the fatigue cycle and basicly walking to a grocery store has been a big thing to do but I noticed huge difference on taking just a pill a week ago. It's also somehow helping my mental state as well and my mind feels a lot more clear. I'm currently experimenting with taking 2x 2000mg daily and thinking about getting L-citrulline also to boost the L-arginine. 

Theres some research overall on L-arginine and L-citrulline being helpfull on joint pain but reading those research papers have been too much to my non-native english skills. Might be the lack of understing on cell-level things also.

So I'm asking if there's someone with any relevant research or any experience on taking L-arginine or L-citrulline?

674,Still no formal diagnosis - RANT,6,1zeq4a,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/1zeq4a/still_no_formal_diagnosis_rant/,5,"Hi. I don't know if I should post to this sub, chronic pain, or some other because I still dont have a formal diagnosis. For the past three weeks or more, I have been having a high level of pain focused on one joint. I hadn't been in to see my rheumy in a year bc it has been almost 3 years since the start of my health issues and I had gotten tired of the endless doctor merrygoround with little other than treating the symptoms and no official answer. In the meantime, I suffer and people around me think I am making it up, faking, being dramatic or whatever.  

This makes me so mad bc I used to be so active. 

3 years ago(ish): I had formerly trained in Tae Kwon Do and had made the switch to jiu jitsu. I also did yoga. And volunteered an as ESL teacher while homeschooling my son and working a part time job. Then I was exposed to TB through one of the refugees I was tutoring. I did not get TB, but I did begin feeling tired and achy all the time. Next thing I know, I can't buckle my seat belt without pain.  I blamed it yoga injury. Then all the other symptoms started. Dry eyes. Pain in more joints. I got a staph infection from my dry skin splitting open and exposing me to a round of it going around at work. But I didnt know it was staph at first.

I went to a doctor who said the dry skin was due to winter (without looking at the site). He gave me a steroid cream to apply and gave me a sample of Lexapro bc apparently when women complain of pain and discomfort, they are just depressed. The steroids made the staph infection go wild. 

In the meantime, I went to a hand surgeon about what I was now sure was carpal tunnel bc my right hand was hurting pretty badly within 5-15 minutes of typing. By this point, I was having hand weakness and burning in my arm. No sign of anything on x ray. I was referred for an EMG and some nerve issues were found. By now, the staph infection was still undiagnosed. 

I kept using the cream and I started being unable to walk correctly.  I was sent onto neurologist after the arm EMG bc of my complaints of impaired walking and arm pain, burning and tingling who dismissed my complaints rather quickly and rudely after mri revealed no plaques. At this point, I was tested for various things. I had a positive ANA result and was sent to rheumy. No other issues showed up in bloodwork other than low vitamin D and I was told to take otc meds for joint pain and given vitamin d rx.

At a certain point, I went to a different primary doc. He diagnosed the split skin issue as being colonized with staph. Not mrsa thankfully. I was given two different antibiotics. I had the worst weakness and walking issues clear up. It took eight months from my first complaint to this point.  

Onto eye doc. Dry eyes confirmed by Schirmers and staining.  This was not enough for a formal Sjogrens diagnosis. Was then sent to have lip biopsy which I skipped due to doctor exhaustion at this point. Neurologist was an a-hole during one of my appointments and I don't cope well with people's attitudes. 

ETC ETC Fast forward, given gabapentin for ongoing neuropathic pain. Told to take aleve for joint pain which made various joints feel hot achy and 'cottony' --dont know how else to describe it. Like they were stuffed with cloth but in a restrictive uncomfortable way. Not a fluffy padded Charmin way. Also diagnosed with Reynauds, but only after providing doctor with photographic evidence of fingers turning blue in an air conditioned office at work. Was given nifedipine. Side effect was a migraine that felt like childbirth via my skull. I've had a kid, so I know what that feels like.  

Fast forward 2013: I get tired of people saying things like, maybe you have fibromyalgia, and they say it condescendingly, with a sneer, like its code for hypochondria. I quit going to docs, quit taking my gabbers, even though they did lessen the arm burning and pain. Suffer. Start drinking more. Gain 11 lbs. I am short and so this is a lot of extra weight for me. Quit yoga. Quit activities. Lay in bed for hours and hours at a time in a combination of fatigue and depression. 


2014: January, fatigue again. Skin splits in original site. The steroid cream first stupid doc prescribed me thinned my skin. It splits really easily all the time now.  Gets colonized again with staph. Also gets a new and improved mystery rash which spreads all the way to my nether regions bc dry skin is near my hindquarters. Antibiotics again. At least it didn't take eight months for them to do something about it this time.

Then a new and improved finger pain comes around. My pinky knuckle. It feels broken. But I didn't do anything to break it. No sleeping anymore. I now have two different kinds of pain on one arm at the same time, non stop. I feel that I am going to go crazy. Go back to the one sympathetic doctor I have, my rheumy. She gives me a gentle lecture for being gone for a year, puts me back on the gabbers and takes xrays and new bloodwork. I was sure the knuckle was broken. Or fractured. Or inflamed. Something. Anything.  Nope. Xrays are normal. Bloodwork--effing normal. No markers of inflammation or others show out of range. She sends me home with a sample of Voltaren Gel, which i immediately begin using and seems to make no difference but comes with an awesomely worrisome side effect warning list. 

So now what? Today the hand started swelling and I was glad. I took photos of it bc this is what I now feel I have to do to get someone to believe me other than my husband.  I dared my hand out loud to swell until it burst open bc then someone would have to do something about it. Something other than NSAIDs. I don't know which doctor to even go to about this. Its like being stuck in a hellish loop of choose your own medical adventure. Do I go (back) to a hand surgeon to see if its a tendon issue? Do I go to a new, hopefully non a-hole neuro and see if it is the neuropathy worsening and bringing some new complication? 

And in the meantime, I want to scream at anyone who dares to be skeptical about my condition when I used to train martial arts with grown men and I got a kick out of fighting and getting knocked around and knocking people back too.  I have had a child, bicycled to work for fun, P90x and all other sorts of extreme type workouts, taken various hits and soreness of all kind and not taken any sort of pain med for it other than a hot bath and gone back for more. So yes, when I say I can't use this hand or even put it through my sleeve without it hurting, it really does hurt. 

Forgive my wall of text. This has been a long time coming and the first time I've gotten it all out. 
TLDR: This stuff sucks. It hurts. We still don't know what all 'it' is and I am frustrated by it all.

Can anyone please tell me if when their hand swells and hurts if they went through anything like this where there was no sign of explanation on the xray but it still ended up showing up on paper through bloodwork later? Tired of not knowing what is going on. Sorry for such a long post. I am angry and in pain.",1393851124.0

If you know of any alternative I'd like to hear about it. And if you've had this problem, have you called them to complain? Perhaps they will change it back when they find out their customers are dissatisfied. Thanks for reading!",1384257245.0

694,"Near tears, confused, need some help",6,1k4fkt,Sjogrens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/1k4fkt/near_tears_confused_need_some_help/,7,"Officially received diagnosis this past Tuesday after a month of having pretty clear test results (only SSA and SSB). I have always had dry eyes and mouth, as well as swollen salivary glands and other issues, but I thought it was normal because I had no frame of reference. This has been the norm for me since I was about 12. I had only gone in the past 6 months because of joint issues I thought were unusual for my age/fitness level.

Honestly, it was something I was more excited/happy about since I felt: hey! There's medication (started Plaquenil) and now I have a rheumatologist to help take care of me, and possible prednisone for really bad days. The day that I had gone in I was feeling great and NOTHING hurt, so rheumatologist said that my joints seemed good.

But today it's completely different and I'm really, really upset for the first time. 

I have fenced for fun and semi-competitively for about 2 years now. It's something that I'm very passionate about and love. For those who know nothing about fencing, there are three different types: epee, foil, and sabre. Each has slightly different rules, target areas, and ways to score on the opponent. I fence epee, and today I was going with a friend to an all sabre practice.

I went there, I felt immediately out of my league, didn't like the coach although I loved the fencers, and starting struggling after my 3rd bout. Everything  I was using just started to hurt: my wrist, fingers, ankles, elbows. I still kept going because I felt like I'd get judged if I had stopped and it was a great opportunity that I would have missed, but I should have. 

I was miserable. I didn't know how to deal with it. I spent most of the time on the verge of tears and trying not to let other people see it. I wish that I had had the prednisone, but I hadn't gotten or filled the prescription since they only order it as needed. I'm calling tomorrow and leaving a message to see if I can have a few on hand because I was 3 hours away and it all just hurt.

I don't know how to handle this. At face value, Sjogren's doesn't seem so bad: dry mouth, dry eyes, whatever. But over the past couple of months the amount of joint pain has increased making it harder and harder to do what I love. Some people noticed because at one point, my friend got me an immobilizing wrist brace, which was great because I couldn't move it, but I can't find a way that I feel comfortable describing what's going on when they ask if I hurt myself. 

I just feel like all I did was come off as a poor sport, I'm in pain, and I'm not really happy right now.

Sorry if this is confusing, it all just happened and I don't feel like editing.",1376216149.0

So I had some labs done by my primary recently due to an infection in my salivary gland, dry mouth, dry eyes and then some joint pain. She had a large panel of blood work done. My SSA antibody, ANA and CNP tests all came back positive. I have an appointment with a rheumatologist on 7/3. I have a slew of other health issues that have been blown off by many doctors over the years that I'm starting to think might be attributed to Sjogren's. I have Interstitial Cystitis (been on Elmiron for years and that seems to help), breathing issues (they couldn't find anything wrong years ago but did zero blood work), intestinal problems (cut out gluten and it helps A LOT) as well as some fertility issues that I am being treated for by a reproductive endocrinologist. 

What I want to know is what happens next? What will the rheumatologist do? How much should I tell them about all of these other issues? I'm really scared about the positive ANA as my primary doc said this could be attributed to the Sjogren's or another autoimmune disease. Is anyone familiar with this particular lab result?
