I just discovered this sub so I feel like an over-eager child with a new toy. But I'm just so excited to discover people who might know what I'm feeling. Along those lines...ever feel like you're being gaslit? And not just by other people but also by yourself?
"I have spent most of my life suffering from one sickness or another. I've been diagnosed with migraines, anemia, PCOS, and Hashimotos. But mostly I've been diagnosed with nothing. After 37 years, I finally feel like I'm seeing a pattern and maybe it's actually been the same sickness all along. But I can't seem to break free from the mindset of ""oh, it's probably from \_\_\_\_"""

*My teeth hurt:* You probably have a sinus infection; You should brush and floss more; You're aging

*My sinuses hurt:* It's the weather; You have a sinus infection

*My throat hurts:* You shouldn't smoke; It's the weather

*My eyes are full of gunk:* That's normal; Clean your contacts more

*I'm so tired:* It's winter; Everyone's Vitamin D is low; You're aging; Everyone's tired

*I can't breathe:* You're overweight; You have anxiety; But does your chest hurt too?

*I can't do that much in one day:* You're lazy; You're depressed

Maybe you have a magnesium deficiency? Maybe you have Lyme? Maybe it's adrenal fatigue? Maybe it's this? Maybe it's that? Maybe it's nothing?

"The other day I was on the phone with my dad and mentioned to him that even though I don't have a diagnosis for Sjogren's yet, I've started to do the things I can to feel better. I am using every trick I can find. (I currently have two humidifiers pointing at my face and I can breathe without thinking about it for the first time days!) And then I found myself telling him that I might be wrong. Maybe this is just making me feel better because of the power of suggestion. Maybe it's placebo effect. (I love placebo effect, by the way. It works even if you know it's placebo! That's fantastic!) And he was there, playing devil's advocate for each of my symptoms and possible solutions. Making me feel, once again, like I'm making a big deal out of everyday pains and looking for patterns where there are none. He wasn't being mean. But that's all I've ever known - ""helpful"" people looking for ways I'm not sick while I'm talking about ways I am."

Why do I keep doing this to myself? Why do I let everyone else do it to me? I feel like crap. I struggle to breathe. I struggle to eat. Sleeping is about the only thing I can do pretty well right now.

This is real. I am sick.

&#x200B;

Right??
Thought I'd make a list of things that can help with various symptoms.

"Feel free to comment with more ideas, and I'll add them to the list. Reviews are good too, on whether these things worked for you or not.

"I knew something felt wrong, something was causing my body to feel the way it did (does). I learned about Sjogren's online about a year before beginning my diagnosis process. I had theories and little support. (Shout out to my future husband who totally ""gets it."")"

"From initially discussing eye issues with doctors to diagnosis by a specialist, it took about a year and a half to start treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Syndrome. After that, I faced a lot of backlash from my mother and mother in law... As if the diagnoses were wrong despite x-rays and repeated blood work, infact my SS-A/SS-B values are approximately 9.0 (normal: 0-0.9) and Rheumatoid factors are 76 (normal: 0-14)."

"Albeit scary, a diagnosis was validating and relieving to me... The diagnoses gave an explanation for all the physical symptoms I had been either ignoring, treating with excessive ibuprofen, or trying to convince myself was ""normal""."

"As someone with a very limited support group, I really value the internet as a source to redefine ""normal"". Sjogren's isn't normal. RA isn't normal....but amongst other people with these diagnoses I have learned that my symptoms ARE normal."

That's a powerful lesson.
It's powerful to be able to post my story here.
"I appreciate this, and I appreciate you."
Thank you.
I’m sorry I don’t know how to link the article but if you go to NYTimes online you should be able to read the article for free.
"Hey everyone, sorry I've been MIA. Had a bad flare and took a break from writing. But, I pressed publish on a post today that I am hoping will help someone else, too. I am sharing 5 eyeliners that someone with sjogren's or super sensitive eyes can wear."

"Sounds trivial, but it's things like this that can improve quality of life (at least for me) when I start to feel like I have to give up so much. Feel free to check it out and share: [https://autoimmunerebel.com/eyeliners-for-sjogrens/](https://autoimmunerebel.com/eyeliners-for-sjogrens/)"

"I'm starting to work on the dry eyes remedies, too, so thank you to everyone who sent such wonderful suggestions!"
My dentist recommended that I buy a dental protector for nighttime grinding of my teeth. Especially with the Sjogren's - she wanted me to get the teeth grinding under control. I bought a cheap one from my local grocery store: Kroger for $15.00USD.

This little doodad helps me create saliva and keeps my mouth very moist. I use it during the day as well- even at work. It has helped better than gum or any of the mints. No calories- no sugar. I do clean it very well very often. I wanted to pass along in case it helps someone else.

Anyone else have any tips for Sjogren's?

"Just a friendly reminder that a lot of people are deficient in vitamin D these days, especially folks with autoimmune conditions. If you've tried a bunch of other things, try supplementing vitamin D."

"I keep forgetting this is a thing and every time I remember and take some I feel loads better within a week. Still not perfect, mind you, but better - much less fatigued and more positive, at least."

"There's also some research that people who have trouble losing weight are often vitamin D deficient, so all the more reason to if that's you, in my opinion."

Of course check with a doctor and test your levels if you're able. Many doctors recommended to take 5000 IUs+ and it can be like night and day. (But of course this depends on you)

Just sharing because I forget a lot. Hope this helps someone ☺️♥️

**Biomarkers/Diagnostic:**

"[ Rheumatoid Factor Subtype Can Serve as Diagnostic Marker for Primary Sjogren’s, Study Says](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/07/31/rheumatoid-factor-serve-diagnostic-marker-primary-sjogrens-syndrome/)."

">Researchers found that IgA and IgG rheumatoid factor levels, but not IgM, were significantly higher in patients with pSS, compared to the idiopathic sicca symptom group."
>
">Additionally, testing for IgA rheumatoid factor demonstrated 83.1% sensitivity (true positive rate) and 78.4% specificity (true negative rate) in the diagnosis of pSS."

[Researchers Identify Potential Target for Treating Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/07/17/protein-identified-potential-target-primary-sjogrens-syndrome/)

">A group of immune cells, called T helper type 17 (Th17), have been identified as the key cells driving inflammation and autoimmunity. In primary Sjogren’s syndrome, Th17 cells are increased and drive the damage of glands. But how they are regulated in these patients is still unknown."
>
">Previous research identified a subunit of the Gq protein, called G*α*q, as a player in rheumatic diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. These conditions are also linked to Th17 activity, suggesting that G*α*q may affect these cells and impact disease activity."
>
">In an attempt to address this question, researchers examined the role of G*α*q in patients with primary Sjogren’s syndrome. They enrolled 39 patients and 40 healthy controls and compared the levels of Gαq in blood cells with other clinical characteristics."
>
">Gαq levels were significantly lower in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome compared to those of healthy controls. And the lower the levels, the more severe the disease, supporting a role for G*α*q in Sjogren’s syndrome."

[B-Cell Biomarkers Linked to Disease Activity Indicators in Primary Sjogren Syndrome](https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/research/b-cell-biomarkers-linked-to-disease-activity-domains-in-primary-sjogren-syndrome/article/780392/)

">In patients with primary [**Sjogren syndrome**](https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/diagnostics/sjogren-syndrome-neurological-manifestations/article/753271/)(pSS), 3 separate biomarkers related to B-cell activity, including B-cell activating factor (BAFF), β-2 microglobulin (β2M), and serum free light chains (FLCs), were associated with various domains of the European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI), according to findings published in *Rheumatology*."
>
">Data show that patients with pSS have elevations in these disease markers, which are known to correlate with overall disease activity."
>
"> Serum measurements from participants in the UK Primary Sjogren's Syndrome Registry Biobank (n=553; 95.1% women; 93.7% Caucasian; mean age, 59.1 years) were analyzed for BAFF, β2M, and FLC levels and were compared with serum measurements from healthy control patients (n=286; 90.9% women; 88.1% Caucasian; mean age, 48.0 years). Patients were assessed for total and domain scores on the ESSDAI and the clinical ESSDAI (ClinESSDAI). The ClinESSDAI, which consists of the ESSDAI without the biological domain, was used to control for confounding."
>
">Patients with pSS had higher levels of all 3 biomarkers compared with control patients, with significant associations between biomarker levels and total ESSDAI and ClinESSDAI scores (*P*<.001 in all cases). Data show that β2M and FLC were strongly correlated (r=0.75; *P* <.001), BAFF and FLC were weakly correlated (r=0.11; *P* <.001), and BAFF and β2M were moderately correlated (r=0.39; *P* <.001). BAFF was also associated with the peripheral nervous system (*P* <.001), whereas β2M and FLCs were associated with renal, cutaneous, and biological domains (*P* <.001 in all cases)."

This one scares me...

">Patients with primary [Sjögren’s syndrome](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/) whose first symptoms are not mouth and eye dryness may experience more progressive and severe pulmonary manifestations during the course of their disease, a study reports."

"[Multiple Limb Weakness May Be Sign of Sjögren’s, Case Report Suggests](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/06/28/multiple-limb-weakness-sign-sjogrens-syndrome-case-report/)"

I think most of us could have told them that...

">Severe muscle weakness in all four limbs may be a symptom of Sjögren’s syndrome, a case report contends."

**Disease hallmarks:**

"[Blood Vessel Cell Junctions Play a Key Role in Sjogren’s Syndrome, Study Suggests](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/08/02/blood-vessel-cell-junctions-play-key-role-sjogrens-syndrome/)"

>The disruption of the junctions that keep blood vessel cells tightly attached may contribute to the lack of saliva and the high infiltration of immune cells in the salivary glands

"Basically, the structure (or lack of) of our blood vessels in our jaws may explain why salivary glands are so hard-hit in SS. Blood vessels that don't attach to others tightly are permeable, and open up surrounding tissue to attack."

">Blocking the signals from interleukin-7 (IL-7) — a protein involved in T-cell development and normal functioning — reduces the [clinical manifestations](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353216) of [Sjögren’s syndrome](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/) in mice, research shows."
>
">These findings suggest that IL-7 and its receptor are important contributors for the autoimmune response in Sjögren’s syndrome, and could represent new therapeutic targets for this disease."

...

">Based on this, researchers at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) evaluated if blocking IL-7 signals at the onset of Sjögren’s syndrome could reduce the symptoms in animal models of the disease. Investigators used an antibody targeting IL-7R, which prevented its interaction with the signaling protein and halted its downstream effects."
>
>Using mice that develop Sjögren’s-like symptoms — including increased infiltration of immune cells in salivary glands and impaired salivary secretion — researchers found that mice who received the anti-IL-7R antibody three times a week fared better than mice receiving a placebo.
>
">These mice had a significantly higher salivary flow rate, indicating a “remission of Sjögren’s syndrome-like exocrine dysfunction,” the researchers wrote. They also had significantly lower immune cell infiltration in the salivary glands."
>
>This occurred because inhibiting IL-7 signaling induced a different behavior in the salivary gland T-cells — they stopped producing and releasing signaling molecules that would attract other immune cells to the salivary glands and that would support the inflammatory process.

Happy reading! Some of it is exciting!
My mom gets in a mood and will binge watch weight loss and fitness shows and I’m not going to lie I enjoy the transformation and watching the workouts. But just once I would love to see a trainer taking on a health issue. Wouldn’t it be great to see someone handle the unique situation of an autoimmune condition? Other than attempting to and failing and making yourself feel like you just shouldn’t try?

A show that takes the patient with doctors and trainers and gives them a basis to live the rest of their lives would be so interesting.

"Over the last 2 years I’ve had dysautonomia, chronic fatigue, POTS, gastroparesis, IBS/constipation, super dry eyes (punctal plugs), dry throat, occasional pill/solid food dysphagia, etc. Nearly every test has come back negative, Sjögren antibodies included. But I finally got a lip biopsy done which showed focal infiltrates and confirmed the Sjogrens diagnosis. No real changes to my medications but will be starting on Plaquenil soon. I’m just so happy to have an answer and not be “crazy” or a “hypochondriac.”"

"I'm 27, diagnosed with Sjogren's a week before turning 26. My rheumatologist stated that this disease is supposed to be drying for our skin, eyes, mouth, other areas, but is anyone else experiencing excessive sweating in areas they've never sweat before?"

"I swear it was right after I got diagnosed: my lower back, my butt, and behind my knees sweat like crazy (like dripping sweat). I've had a sweating problem with my underarms since I could remember, but sweating everywhere else is new to me."

Thyroid tests were as normal as they could be for us.
"After going through a littany of tests including a shurmers (sp?) and a salivary gland biopsy, I was diagnosed with Sjogrens."

For a long time I've had strange cognitive and neuro type symptoms which has required treatment for anxiety and depression.

I forget things really easily and I feel a bit like I'm just kind of living in a movie at times.

Do people have symptoms like this with Sjogrens? I don't have a lot of knowledge about it other than that it's an autoimmune disease.

Thanks everyone! I'm glad to find this group.

Does anyone else struggle to reconcile body pain with their other Sjogrens symptoms?

"Since 2004 I have had terrible chronic pain that feels like my connective tissue is squeezing my joints and muscles so tightly, and ‘campfire face’ (what I explain my eyes, mouth, and skin feel  like, like I’m sitting way too close to a campfire for hours) since around the same time, however even with blood tests to show autoimmune dysfunction I still struggle to feel like the 2 things are connected... why does a condition that causes my eye problems also cause such extensive body pain."

Some days I feel like I am going crazy and wish that I could ‘see’ a cause for my pain. Does that make sense to anyone else?
"I read about this study however I can't access it for free. Its results are mentioned here, in another study testing sea buckthorn for another condition."

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512214002394#bib0055

"Is anyone taking it? I've seen some reviews on different SB products  on amazon from women with Sjogren's and they seem promising. From what I gather there's SB seed and fruit, and for dry mucous membranes you want either a combo or the fruit one, as the seed oil is primarily for something else."

"ETA: vaginal dryness, lubrication (adding terms for search tool)"
"Hello! I have Sjogrens, Hereditary Angioedema Type 3, and Pernicious Anemia (B12 deficiency). I got diagnosed with the PA more recently, one thing I have found is that the B12 shots seem to help keep the Sjogrens somewhat in check, I don't know if this helps anyone, but as my shot wears off, my Sjogrens flares up a bit more until the next shot."
"Does anyone wake up in the morning with what feels like bruising near your temples, cheeks and along the jawline. Pain and swelling at the base of the skull and a headache I can only describe as low, and deep, but feel likes it is radiating off the swelling in the face and on the side of the face. After some heat it usually loosens up and my eyes and nose start watering like crazy. PLEASE tell me I am not alone in this world! Xoxox"

Sjogren's syndrome is ruining my life.

"I just started at a great job, just last week. And already, it looks like I'm going to have to miss a day of work due to a flare."

"I have really bad salivary glands. My submandibular glands are affected. Since this summer's heat spell, my glands have been swollen and blocked constantly. Every day I have some amount of swelling. Every day I'm massaging mucus plugs out of my glands. It is extremely uncomfortable and distracting. It's like the urge to defecate, but in your mouth - that's the only way I can describe it."

"I've been kept up all night with a blockage. And when I get this blocked, I know that the joint pain and fatigue will follow within a day or two. Its 3 am and I'm supposed to be up at 5 to cook my lunch and get ready for work."

"I'm spitting into a glass to monitor what's coming out of the gland, and I cant even call that saliva. It's semi-solid bullshit. Cloudy water with wispy mucus and little bits of plug - because the massaging only breaks up what's in there."

I'm so upset. I need this job to be able to afford my medical tests so I can maybe get some medication. I really want to do well at it. Why did I have to have this stupid disease?
What neuropathic issues do you guys suffer with?
"I just need to vent. I am 29 and was diagnosed very young. As I get older, the total body symptoms get worse. When I was younger, it was dry eye and dry mouth--okay, fine. Now its fevers, joint pain, extreme, crushing fatigue. I missed a day of work this week due to this for the first time in two years and I am worried my medication (Imuran) is starting to fail. I want to work out and run around and have fun and survive on 7 hours of sleep, but I have been in a flare up since Christmas that I just can't kick. All I can do is prednisone and rest for now."
"I have 9 year old twins (38f),  was diagnosed with Sjogrens, MS, and Hashimotos weeks ago.  In trying to explain to my family the dryness caused by Sjogrens, my twin daughter proclaimed how jealous she was that if my nose was always dry,  I must never have ""slime or boogers"" to deal with."

"Im already depressed, and now I get this diagnosis. I actually was diagnosed a year ago but didn't have a GP to follow up with so it kind went under my radar. How do I keep it from progressing? Im so scared. Its like i have a clock ticking over my head. Im so sad. The doctor said to just drink lots of water, but I've recently noticed clicking in my ankles when I run so Im thinking I might have to stop running?"
I work on a IT help desk.  We document everything.

"And, we need to do that in our medical care."

Right now my wife is working to try to get some infusions of a drug due to a complication.  Our doc is hopeful they may help.

"But, we are being denied by the insurance company due to some things missing from her medical record."

"Over the years my wife has had many symptoms and we do report them, but we don't get to see the notes the physician records.  And, given the many symptoms, and time, we have to ask, ""Did we report them?"""

"So, our new practice is after the physician visit, we'll use the ""patient portal"" like MyChart, to document the visit from OUR perspective."

"Like, ""On my visit on 2-8-19, we mentioned the symptom 1, symptom 2, and symptom 3.  You prescribed pill A for symptom 1, and we'll see about symptoms 2 and 3 once you have the lab results.  Is there anything else you told us during the visit?"""

"So, if you ever have to review all of your records, not only will you have the basic information provided by their patient portal, you will also have your side of the story."

This would be very useful in our appeal process with the insurance company.

"What's your go-to Omega 3 Brand? So many are complete trash and I don't know where to begin! My eye doctor wants me to have at least 1,000mg (but preferably 2,000mg) of combined DHA and EPA daily. *My Rheumatologist also agrees with that.*"

I’ve been having nerve pain all over my body for the past few months. My sjorgens diagnosis is fairly recent and I also have RA but my rheumatologist thinks that my nerve pain is a separate issue.

"I saw a neurologist and she ruled out the other causes of nerve pain (diabetes, MS, vitamin deficiencies) and concluded it is from the sjorgens."

"I’m on Gabapentin so it’s not as frequent, but the pain is everywhere when I do have it- arms, legs, chest, and especially the face."

Has this happened to anyone else? I’m wondering if my arthritis doctor just hasn’t seen it before.
My illness started with sore throat and now I get it again most of the time.
"My husband sjogrens is severe. His throat sticks together and he literally chokes on air. To be able to breath, he has to eat a gallon of ice cream a day. And, I do mean a gallon. With multiple conditions, I cannot afford this anymore. It's 300+ dollars a month for ice cream that is thick enough to get the swelling down in his throat and stomach. But, I just can't do it anymore. I love him but I am at a financial breaking point over this. I told him today we need a solution or we are getting a divorce and I meant it. It would break our hearts but my kid's being able to have a roof over their head is more important to me than my heart."

Please give me your suggestions. I haven't been able to find anything or make anything that was affordable.

"Any ideas to give me some relief from shortness of breath? I've got a humidifier, though it's new so I might just need more time with it."
Are there any other over-the-counter options that have worked to get you easier full breaths?



"Hi all,"

I'm 23F and just diagnosed after having symptoms for approx. 2 years. It took me a long time to come around to accepting this was the right diagnosis - I didn't notice any sicca dry eye / mouth symptoms at first. Have a couple of questions:

"1. My main symptom has always been painful, usually daily swelling in partoid and submandibular glands. Does anyone else experience this to the point they just can't eat or drink and get terrible nerve pain from gland up to ear? Massage helps a little, heat packs don't seem to do much, sucking on a lemon is extremely painful. My immunologist actually asked me if I had tried taking ibuprofen ... like that wasn't obvious. Nothing seems to work for those extremely painful flares - any tips?"
"2. How do you talk to employers about SS? I will leave my current full time job next year and I am so worried I will not be able to maintain a full time job with the amount of specialist appointments you seem to need. Particularly as my vision is now being impacted by looking at bright computer screens. I also just feel like I can't properly explain to a potential employer all of the effects SS has on me, as it is not well understood."

Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for your help.
Prickly skin and nerve pain all over.  Terrible widespread skin indentations that occur very very very easily.  Bumps that look like goosebumps on arms.  Bad rashes.  A lot of pain.  I now cannot wear even a warm jumper in the cold and sometimes wearing a very light coat even hurts.  This has ruined my life.
Is it possible for someone to have Sjogren’s without SSa or SSb positive?

"I have had a sudden onset (started 7months ago) of Dry eye, dry mouth, frequent urination, constipation, dry skin, dry flaky scalp, dry hair,  vertically ridged &amp; brittle finger nails, low energy and insomnia."

"differences in my teeth (slightly yellow now with transparency in 1/3 of two front teeth, despite them being perfect months ago)"

"I’m a 26 year old male with Double strand DNA antibodies 32IU/ml , Anti-centromere Antibody positive, Anti-ENA positive, ANA screen positive"

"I was previously very a very healthy university athlete, 6’ 200lbs, previously had oily curly hair (now it’s just frizzy mess and noticing lots of broken strands on my pillow) oily smooth skin is now uncomfortably dry and flaky."

It all started after being put on high dose antibiotics followed up by a 2 month course of neuroleptics due to a 2 day drug-induced psychosis... My life is in shambles.
"40 year old Male.  Does anyone else have rashes that appear on their arms and skin indentations that appear from barely any pressure at all and hang around for ages?  I never used to have any of this!  I'm also tired of the parasthesia,dry skin, and fatigue.  My lovely hair is also ruined and just snaps and falls out."

"I was perfectly well and super fit start of 2018.  I've been through hell.  Lost the love of my life cruelly to another man, lost the dream.  My doctors have been useless, uncaring, and it's been a battle.  I'm now isolated, lonely, and stuck."
Hi guys! One of my friends was recently diagnosed with Sjogrens. I’d like to put together a care package for her. Do you have any suggestions? Things you love that might help someone else? Thanks in advance!!


"Living with an invisible disease. I can’t begin to imagine what that’s like. Like most people, I have loved ones in my life with invisible diseases – my college roommate who began experiencing fibromyalgia at the tender age of 20; my sister with her chronic, undiagnosed stomach pain; dear friends with chronic fatigue; family members with depression – so I have some awareness of what they go through. But to actually live with an invisible disease, never knowing when symptoms will flare or when disabling fatigue will hit? I simply can’t imagine what these people go through."

"I am learning about Sjögren’s Disease in preparation for April’s Sjögren’s Awareness Month. Layer after layer of the disease’s symptoms and mysteries and complications are swimming in front of my eyes. Blepharitis, neuropathies, gastroparesis, cirrhosis. I’m familiar with each as a single diagnosis, not an autoimmune cocktail. But there they are, a few among many, complications ready to shake the world and stir up trouble."

"Add to that frustration, fear, anxiety, depression, isolation."

### Autoimmune disease speaks a thousand difficult languages.

"As I share information about Sjögren’s in our social media, I want to remind everyone, no matter what their health status is, that just because a symptom can’t be easily seen, it is still important. Important for the medical team to know about and consider as a component of diagnosis and treatment. Important for the patient to know that she is not dreaming up symptoms to fulfill an autoimmune destiny. Important for friends, family, and coworkers to know that unseen symptoms are valid and can disrupt plans, goals, adventures."

Life.

"### Sjögren’s. So many layers. Too few answers. But hope, always hope, on the horizon."

"Hope from the medical community as they diagnose and treat patients and guide them through a maze of symptoms and opportunities. Hope from the research world as it studies antibodies and homes in on data that may shine light on potential treatments and cures. Hope from each Sjögren’s patient and their support network that each tomorrow will be a good day, a fulfilling day, an inspired day. Hope. Always hope."

"Has everyone noticed how bright the sun looks with Sjogrens? Wearing sunglasses used to stop me from squinting, but not anymore. I find my self still squinting through sunglasses. It's so bright I can't it and it feels like I might actually go blind. I find myself wearing sunglasses these days even on gloomy days because no matter what, outside is SO bright. I used them to protect my eyes from the wind too. Has anyone had Vit D deficiency with Sjogrens? I've had it throughout my life with B12 deficiency. I have been extra tired lately and am going to be getting alot of blood test taken because I think hiding from the sun is depriving me of the good old Vitamin D."
I have Sjogrens and Lupus and for the past few weeks I have noticed that my hands and arms have been falling asleep at night.

I wake up in the middle of the night and have to change positions and shake my arms and hands to wake them up. Sometimes I have to do this a couple times a night.

Does anyone know if this is a symptom of Sjogrens or Lupus?
"I never realize how dry my eyes had been this entire time. I was rubbing them constantly, to the point my astigmatism got worse. I didn't even know this disorder existed."

"I thought I might have an autoimmune disorder, and, when the doctor asked pointed questions about dry eyes and mouth, I had no idea what she was leading up to."

"I already drink lots of water every day. I literally carry a water bottle with me everywhere. I chew gum a lot too. But my eyes? I never even knew that it wasn't ""normal."""

"I got eye drops for the first time today, and I might already be addicted. It was immediately soothing, and it felt so amazing! I had never realized how dry my eyes were until I gave them the drops!"

"I guess this is a weird thing to be excited about, but it's so freeing to not have my eyes be irritated all the time. I never knew that it was a constant problem until it stopped."
Do any of you have heat sensitivity? Do you get overheated easily and/or sweat easily?
I recently had the horrific experience of cutting onions post-Sjogren's. My eyyyyyyes. And I have very mild eye dryness.

"If you haven't, don't try it."
Hello!

"I have not been officially diagnosed with sjogen's syndrome yet, but my doctor is leaning towards it due to my bloodwork and the symptoms I have been experiencing. Some of the symptoms I've been having - tingling on my feet and legs, very dry mouth, and constant headache. I am feeling very nervous and anxious... On that note, I have a lot of questions! I would greatly appreciate it if any of these questions could get answered."

1) Will the headaches and dry mouth feeling go away with proper medication?

2) Has anyone tried the autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet? Or is there any diet that has helped decrease inflammation?

3) I have read online that sjogen's syndrome is partly due to genetics and environment? What does it mean by environment?

4) I am only 25 years old and I'm worried that sjogen's syndrome will greatly affect my lifestyle and possibly get worse as I get older. What should I be expecting in the future? Will this affect my job?

I would also greatly appreciate any other tips or general information about sjogen's syndrome. Thank you!
"I’m not officially diagnosed, but I strongly suspect Sjogren’s."

"Anyway, one of the symptoms I’ve had was the dry eyes/lack of tears. I’ve always been an emotional person (BPD) and I cry at the drop of a hat. The past two years, I haven’t cried, and my eyes stopped watering when I yawned (they would water very heavily.) We had to put our cat down today, and the floodgates opened. I’ve been crying on and off since 12:30 (almost 8 hours.)"

"Does this mean I don’t have Sjogren’s, or can we actually cry on occasion? I’ve tried Google but it’s not helpful. Thanks in advance."
"I have suspected I have Sjogrens for many years now.  I had to make a kind of emergency trip to the eye doctor last week when my always dry morning eye was suddenly painful, my normal drops stung, and my lids were swollen.  Turns out my eye (not the cornea) was abraded or something, he couldn't figure out what would have done that.  I told him my regular eye doc did that paper test and said, yep, you sure do have dry eye, but neither of them seemed concerned except to prescribe me those expensive drops."

"Twenty years ago I quit smoking (am in my 60's now)  and was able to quit by using nicotine gum, then I couldn't stop that so switched to regular chewing gum and now can literally not do without it.  I always have a piece in my mouth, and also have to drink a lot of water just to be able to speak legibly, otherwise my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth."

"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's about thirty years ago and my Levoxyl/Synthroid script keeps getting increased due to regular hsa tests   I also am prone to oral and facial cold sores (herpes, yuck) that got so bad I take a prophylactic dose of an antiviral daily."

"Dental problems...forget it.  I just don't go anymore, they always cause a flare of my cold sores, especially inside my mouth (not canker sores.)  I have had so many root canals etc., go bad that my oral health is better if I just stay home and keep hygienic."

"I guess lastly, the last few years I have started to feel just lousy.  So fatigued and joint and muscle pain that I have had to give up my favorite pastimes like hiking, dancing, and now my hands hurt if I keyboard to much. I can't take vacations anymore, long car or plane rides put my knees and hips in so much pain that it ruins the trip for everyone.  The doctors are stumped, and I am usually patted on the head and reminded that I am getting older...hence my worry about being labeled a hypochondriac."

"There are other things, like swollen lymph nodes under my jaw, sore throat, have had xrays and the ana test, but nothing shows up."

"Anyway, how do you approach your doctor about a possible autoimmune disorder like Sjogrens.  They hate it when patients diagnose themselves, I think.  In any case, this has been helpful to write it all down.  Maybe it will help organize my thoughts if I decide to approach my doctor about Sjogrens.  And as you kids say,"

tl;dr   Thanks!

"Personally I think the biggest issue that led me down this path was constantly getting lung and bronchial infections and UTIs that the doctors never told me about they just constantly prescribed antibiotics, I am nearly always feeling like trash and healing pretty damn slow along with always being covered in bruises and feeling dehydrated and unable to keep up with it. Things got way worse after I had my son in December of 2016, I’ve always had intense dental problems proper hygiene aside, countless dollars in dental work growing up. Constantly peeing from drinking so much water and still feeling thirsty, but all in all I developed a condition called Recurrent Corneal Erosion, and haven’t found anything on it in regards to Sjogrens."

"Has anyone else discovered their “underlying” and debilitating condition from extreme eye complications? I’ve almost needed surgery multiple times, and had countless emergency visits where my optometrist comes in on a damn holiday just so I can get antibiotics and a bandage lens placed. I’m always getting fluids in urgent care or the ER no matter what I drink. Summer is the worst. My oddest symptom is probably issues with hyperpigmentation and other various skin abnormalities. Addison’s disease is still being looked into by Endocrinology."

"I’ve seen a neurologist, cardiologist, gastroenterologist, optometrist, PCP, endocrinologist, and now awaiting Rheumatologist. I’ve even been referred to infectious disease specialists because my doctors were so at a loss. Forgive any improper terminology as I’m admittedly ignorant at times haha."

"About 4 months ago my GI symptoms got so severe from undiagnosed Celiacs that I got my GI referral, I’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy even to rule out the big bad C word since I also had pretty intense and intermittent rectal bleeding (sorry tmi) I lost about 30 lbs in a month and a half and that’s the other kicker I’ve been trying to pin down the cause of, I can eat exorbitant amounts of junk food and calories and MAYBE gain 3 lbs. it’s a constant battle to stay at my weight. My stomach is perpetually in upset in one form or another, I feel internal tremors and bizarre movement and popping sensations beyond normal gas bubbles. Then I developed heat and exercise intolerance problems and tachycardia that comes and goes, debilitating nausea and light-headedness, I’m actually wearing a ZIO patch for a week (primary wanted a month but we agreed on a week) that they are hoping to determine if it’s POTS or SVT from."

"My CBC and Metabolic panels constantly come back “mostly” normal. My MPV and Anion gap are always very elevated and my RDW is recently getting pretty low. My kidney function seems to flip back and forth a lot in terms of functioning “too” well I was told and then being not so great. And I’ve even developed this bizarre Myoclonus (suspected terminology via consult the neuro hasn’t seen it but it started months ago as a twitch in my left thigh and has massively escalated, awaiting seeing my neuro again since it started becoming a daily problem) basically I’d have such odd muscle spasms/jerks that would cause me to repeatedly fall down or nearly fall down. I’m taking a low dose of Keppra that the ER prescribed with neuro consult to manage it because if I take more than half a pill of the Keppra I sleep for 4 days straight, I’ve noticed I’m highly sensitive to narcotic pain medication and medication with a sedating effect of any kind even antihistamines. I always wonder if that’s in part due to my dehydration problems."

"I have bizarre lines and ridges going both directions in my nails and my nail beds are shrinking by the day which is a more recent symptom, evidence of early clubbing in my nails even documented in ER and was curious if anyone else had a similar presentation of symptoms with their hands and nails."

"All in all I have minimal background info on what the systemic results of this illness are and how it’s impacted others lives, I have nobody with anything close in my life and it makes it an even bigger struggle, so if anyone has tips or methods on explaining how this is so debilitating in everyday life in a way close ones and family members can grasp I’d also be eternally in debt. I get constantly belittled and insulted by my father that I live with due to being a single mother and I get called lazy and stupid and everything else in the book, they don’t understand the extent of my health problems and it’s a burden how much help I’ve needed help caring for my son at times, the guilt is causes is unrelenting. Luckily my son is beautiful and happy. My father has outright said it’s all in my head and the doctors will never find out what’s wrong with me and they never have gotten it right when I was young even, I was diagnosed with complex partial right temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy at the age of 3 that mostly produced absence seizures in the day and convulsive nocturnal ones that caused me to wet the bed until I was nearly 15.  A heart murmur that repaired itself, and like violently intense ADHD, I was heavily medicated on stimulants as a child just so I could attend public school and then my health was so poor as a teenager (mental and physical) that I had to do high school at home. I have a slight lazy eye that’s trained (mostly). But overall nothing too outrageous."

"My period started in like 4th grade which is relatively early and puberty hit me like a damn train. I get frequent painful symptomatic ovarian cysts but do not have PCOS. One instance of one rupturing and almost requiring surgery a couple of years ago. Intestinal problems around 18 that almost required surgery (impaction more or less I ate something that wasn’t food.) I’ve never had great health but it isn’t horrible in my opinion. Within the past months my period has gone from heavy and like clockwork to short, late, light or not even there, I get cramps between periods all the time and I can’t get my OB who is also my PCP to listen to me about how it isn’t normal or okay.  Because there’s a lot of other health problems going on he just doesn’t want to unless I make a separate appointment and even then he won’t indulge me FULLY. So it’s a waste of my effort and money and time."

"I attribute it in part to being born of a mother with gestational diabetes and in turn I was born 10 lbs and 3 months early, massively underdeveloped heart and lungs, NICU for a week before I could be handled. Lack of oxygen while my heart was restarted multiple times is a suspicion for cause of my epilepsy. Basically I was trying to breathe amniotic fluids still when I needed to breathe air, is how it was explained. I was born not breathing."

"I always have had deep curiosity about preemies and their likelihood to developing health problems later in life but I never find much online, however in my instance I feel there is a connection. Maybe that’s just for peace of mind though."

"This has just been a crazy diagnostic ride, first they thought PID, then eosinophilic esophagitis, then diabetes, then MS, Parkinson’s, they’ve looked into so many freaking diseases and whatnot it’s a miracle my insurance hasn’t committed homicide or canned me somehow. Sorry for the poor format and post construction as I’m managing a turkey of a two year old and am on mobile!"

"Also I’m curious about age of onset, as I’m a 26 y/o female. Symptoms that were more severe such as RCE developed over two years ago and have just gradually worsened. It’s taken 3 months for my doctor to even take my concerns seriously even with CONSTANT trips to urgent care and the emergency room for one problem or another, did anyone else face dismissal from their PCP?"

Looking forward to some feedback and I hope everyone is doing well with their symptom management and treatment and making the best of the weather as well! You all are amazing! ❤️ Is this post is out of line in any way just let me know and I’ll remove it!
"Hi all, another question (sorry, I am still new to all this :( )."

"I just lost my ability to cry. Reading the posts here, I see that this is a relatively common complaint. I'm in the category of folks who cannot imagine coping without crying, so I'm pretty freaked out."

"I've only read one post here about tears actually returning. Anyone else? In your experience, does the inability cry come and go with flares, or is it apparently permanent?"

Thanks everyone <3 !

I know there are subreddits for chronic fatigue but I wanted specific advice/experiences from Sjogren's Syndrome perspective.

"How do you deal with chronic fatigue in your everyday life? How does it impact your work, relationships and psychological well-being? Has anyone used strong sedative prescription medication or even illicit drugs to cope with the pains and fatigue? Or anyone really not coping well at all despite trying?"

Any personal experience/thoughts and advises would be greatly appreciated!




"I've recently been diagnosed with Sjogren's, and am on Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) and Evoxac (cevimeline). One thing that I've noticed recently, is that I'll be laying around relaxing, then all of the sudden, I'll feel HOT. In the span of a minute, I'll go from relaxing under a blanket, to removing layers, sweating, and struggling to cool down. I also feel a big light-headed and unsteady, but heat is the primary symptom."

"I'm new to Sjogren's and haven't done a lot of research yet, so wasn't sure if it was a symptom (or medication side-effect). I'm not in menopause, but I am mid-40's, so I guess hot flashes wouldn't be out of the question either..."

Thanks for the help! :D

"* Plaquenil has ""fever with or without chills"" as a side-effect, but I don't have an elevated temperature (about 1-2 degrees above normal)."
"* Cevimeline has ""temperature sensation changes"" listed as a rare side-effect, but I have no idea what that really means."
Currently 15 weeks pregnant and terrified of heart block. Has anyone had a baby with Sjogrens and can tell me their experience?

The hospital are looking after me really well and I'm being scanned every two weeks.
Is morning muscle stiffness a symptom of Sjogrens? Lately when I wake up my muscles are so stiff and sore. Feels like I’ve been working out hard from the day before but I haven’t. My calves are especially tight. Does anyone else have this? What helps loosen up?
"Hey all,"
Sorry for the whining but I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't have that many people to talk about this topic.
"I had my lip biopsy yesterday. I've been having more health issues than usual in the last few years: fatigue, depressive episodes, dry eyes, dry mouth and thick mucous, tingling/burning sensation in my right arm almost every day, terrible joint pains every now and then, recurrent sinus infections until I had to have surgery etc. I was so devastated that I ordered the 23andMe genetic health test for Christmas and I came back saying I have a roughly 2x higher risk of SLE and Sjogren's. I've been running from one doctor to the next, all blood results came back negative until I had my eye doctor suggest Sjogren's as a possibility. I finally managed to find a rheumatologist who immediately ordered the lip biopsy, he also said that Sjogren's is not that unlikely. I'll get the results next week."

"The thing is, I'm more scared for the results to come back negative than anything else. I haven't even thought about how my life would look like if I actually got the diagnosis. All I know is that I really want some kind of explanation for how shitty I'm feeling. My family and friends constantly see me being sick or whining about this and that. My personality has changed so much in that I don't trust myself anymore, I don't make plans anymore because I'll cancel them last minute. All I want to do these days is stay at home and not bother anyone with my ailments. Nearly all the people I confide in have their secret tips of meditating, osteopathy, walking and what not. I have tried everything, but when I take like an hour walk outside, I come back home and I have to lie down because my whole body aches. I feel that no one understands how I really feel."

"My partner is still very supportive but it feels like I'm draining her energy with the lack of results. I have the feeling people soon won't believe me anymore. I just called my mum and told her about the lip biopsy, and she was full of herself as usual and didn't even ask what this test was for this time."

"I promise I will try my best and live with it, but I'm really desperate for the results. What do I do if it's not Sjogren's? Am I going crazy?"
"Hey there. I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren's. Up until about a week ago, my symptoms were pretty consistent: low grade fevers almost every day, terrible fatigue, dry eyes and mouth, body aches and random skin flare-ups that would come and go. I've had those symptoms for over a year now, they're awful, but at least I'm sort of used to them."

&#x200B;

"Recently, though, I have noticed the skin lining my lips and on my gums above my front teeth had become darkened. Like a dark grey, really unhealthy color. I am planing to see a dentist soon anyway, but have any of you guys had a similar experience? Can it be part of the Sjogren's experience or something completely unrelated? It doesn't hurt or sting or anything, but it looks a bit troubling."

&#x200B;

"Also, how are you handling work? I just got back to a full time job recently and am really, REALLY struggling due to the fevers, pain and fatigue, it just seems undoable most days."
"I don’t understand it. Most recently it happened when I started in a new department at work. Mid sentence when my supervisor was speaking to my college and I about a project we’re working on, he pauses. “Your eyes are really red”."

Is that a question or a statement?

I replied “I have eye problems” as I didn’t want to go down the whole auto immune explanation route.
He replied “Oh ok I thought it was hayfever”...long pause...
"Me: “Oh no it’s not that”...another pause, he seemed to want more of an explanation...”There’s not really much I can do about it” (trying to smile, but dying inside)"
"He laughed and the sort of looks awkward and says “oh ok then” and starts talking about the project again. ——something really annoying about this particular comment is the company as a whole knows about my sjogrens and medical problems, they have accommodated me really well and have been really nice. Day to day colleagues...not so much."

"I’ve had this SO MANY TIMES. I don’t know how much more my self esteem can take. I am a strong person, but when one of my biggest insecurities is picked out in front of people I find it really hard to deal with. I hate it and I hate myself and people seem to point it out at the worst of times!"

Another time was when I was getting a tea before my first day at my new job. The guy behind the till seemed to think it was ok to just state that my eyes we’re red. In front of the whole queue and his colleges! 10 mins later the man at reception of my building asked if I had the flu because I “looked really ill” (I didn’t have the flu. I had also never seen this man before so how does he know how I normally look?).

"Another one was someone who I was aquatinted with, not a mate but he was around all the parties and get togethers I went too. Mid conversation when we were talking about something (I can’t even remember what) he replied to what I said with “is that why you always have red eyes then?” With a horrible smirk. Everyone just stood quiet and awkwardly."

"I was also out for a works mates birthday a while back. Maybe about 8 of us sitting around a table. My work mate told me my eyes were as red as the devils dick. I went home early in tears that night. I hid my tears and just told my friend I was tired, but I broke down to my boyfriend when I got in the house."

I’m lucky my boyfriend has been pretty good. And when he has been there when stuff has been said he has stuck up for me and he’s amazing. But unfortunately that doesn’t help my self esteem. I hate myself and these people make me hate myself even more. One minute I think I’m feeling better and then I get a comment like today at work. I’m finding it really difficult to deal with.

"My question is: Why do people think it’s ok to comment on this? What do I say back? I might ask this in a different thread too, maybe askreddit, where I can ask people who don’t suffer with auto immune diseases! Because I know you lot will know what its like to be asked these things!"

I know it could be worse. But that doesn’t stop my heart sinking and my self esteem going down further than I ever thought it could. I hope someone gets this! Thanks for reading even if there are no answers.
"I get a full body shiver occasionally, though especially after I've eaten, I think. I can feel it build up in me and then my whole body trembles. I'm told it looks like I've shimmered out of reality for a second."
Does anyone else get these? Could it be related to Sjogren's or another autoimmune jerk?
I know it's a normal human thing to shiver... but this seems different. I don't think I've ever been able to properly explain it though.

I just order some on Amazon VIA Life Extension ( in case u want to read comments) and will give it a go. Seems to cause gastro upset in some people but benefits seem pretty amazing. Basically acts as an immune modulator. Ill let you. know how it goes.

Has anyone else tried it?
What causes Sjogren’s? The simple answer is there isn't a consensus on what causes SS.

"“Researchers think Sjögren’s syndrome is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Several different genes appear to be involved, but scientists are not certain exactly which ones are linked to the disease, because different genes seem to play a role in different people. For example, there is one gene that predisposes Caucasians to the disease. Other genes are linked to Sjögren’s syndrome in people of Japanese, Chinese, and African American descent. Simply having one of these genes will not cause a person to develop the disease. Some sort of trigger must activate the immune system."


"Scientists think that the trigger may be a viral or bacterial infection. It might work like this: a person who has a Sjögren’s-associated gene gets a viral infection. The virus stimulates the immune system to act, but the gene alters the attack, sending fighter cells (lymphocytes) to the glands of the eyes and mouth. Once there, the lymphocytes attack healthy cells, causing the inflammation that damages the glands and keeps them from working properly. This is an example of autoimmunity. These fighter cells are supposed to die after their attack in a natural process called apoptosis, but in people with Sjögren’s syndrome, they continue to attack, causing further damage. Scientists think that resistance to apoptosis may be genetic.”"

Resubmitted since I can't count.

I had my annual ophthalmology appointment on Friday and my doctor suggested tear duct plugs and restasis. I can’t tell you what a difference it has made in just the 24 hours that I have been using them.

My nose before the tear duct plugs was constantly running and now it isn’t and my eyes are much more wet. It also helps with the morning and evening restasis eye drops. She suggested I keep them in the fridge and holy crap it’s wonderful when I put them in! So refreshing and lasts for the majority of the 12 hours between drops.
"Has anyone here divorced because of being sick? My husband seems to want to divorce because I’m in pain and suffering all the time. He actually said he wanted to divorce 1-2 months ago then changed his mind. He says he resents me a lot from the heavy drinking I used to do this time last year and even though I quit and don’t do it at all anymore the damage has been done. He also said he didn’t want to say part of the reason was bc of me getting sick but in all actuality it plays a role. I love him so much and don’t know how I’d cope with losing him but I have some resentment as well from his shitty behavior, difference being he chose to do it where as I didn’t. I’m incredibly sad and I don’t know how I’d support myself if we split. Especially since he is the one with insurance by I’m the one who needs it so bad. I don’t want a divorce but I also don’t want him hating me. F*** this disease and everything it took from me."
"Hello, my Mother-in-law has Sjogren and is taking all the medications prescribed. Doing some research, I’ve found some studies about baking soda... has anyone tried it and has it helped?"

"Nothing specific to Sjogren but to autoimmune diseases, which this might be helpful?"

Here’s a [article about baking soda and autoimmune disease. ](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180425093745.htm)
"My doctor refuses to prescribe Plaquenil and says there is no link between it's use and Sjogrens.  He begrudgingly prescribed gabapentin after months of wrangling.  However I am told it will not help me at all and might make me worse.  How did they help you?   My worst symptoms are hair loss, itching skin, and terrible paraesthesia all over."
I am having lot of eye pain these days. Is it something else or can happen with this?
"I’m awaiting my lip biopsy to confirm what my neurologist calls Seronegative Sjrogrens. My primary symptoms are small fiber neuropathy that I feel is effecting my peripheral nerves, muscles, as well as some autonomic functions. The results of my EKG just came back as “borderline” and tho my lungs seem to look clear (from a recent X-ray) I’m having difficulty getting a deep breath and also finding myself short of breath when talking. I’m curious if anyone experiences something similar and/or has involvement in other organs and systems? Nearly everything has been ruled out with either blood tests and a few imaging/biopsy results so it’s being narrowed down to Sjrogrens. I am researching all angles and just don’t want to overlook anything. Thanks in advance!"
"I’ve tried every sinus medication you can think of...nothing. My sinuses are always out of whack: swollen tonsils, dry throat (not my mouth), runny nose. It almost feels like there’s something in the back of my throat but it’s also really dry feeling in the same spot (like right behind my tonsil)."

Anybody have any remedies?? I can’t take this anymore!

"While I’m here...my eyes are also super dry, even with gas perm lenses and constantly using preservative free eye drops (before I even put them in and all throughout the day)."

If anyone has any advice on how to help with anything like this it would be greatly appreciated!!
Is this due to dry eye? It lasts all day but bad after waking up. Eye drops don't help much. Is this due to dry eye or I am not getting good quality sleep?
For years (due to several misdiagnosis and how blood work has changed for different conditions) I was told I had SLE lupus.

"Today after finally getting a rhuem in a new state, she spent 30 mins talking with me and reviewing my records and she says the following:"

You don't have Lupus at all you have Sjogrens.

Say what?

"I had never heard of it, but all my issues (save the blatant ones for psoraic arthritis) have pointed to Sjogrens and no one for almost 20 years put it together.(she ran specific blood work for sjogrens and it came back positive)"

"Now my head is whirling and I'm trying to get all the reasearch and knowledge that I can because what I had been looking out for as ""warning signs"" for years are totally different now."


I just needed to find a group who could point me in the best direction for resources and see if this had happened to anyone else??

I’ve noticed lately that I am handling my symptoms less and less well. Avoiding stress to help it is an impossibility since I live with my father who has dementia and is handicapped. I currently like my job but I have to keep cutting my hours due to issues with him or flare ups. (Can’t really sell to people when your fingers are bright purple or your eyes are bright red) I’m only 28 and I refuse to begin the talks about disability because I just don’t think I’m there yet. I have thought about working a job from home though.

Has anyone begun working from home with someone legitimate that actually pays well enough to survive? I feel like I’m just looking at scams 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Lasik seems to not be a good option. I desperately want to not have to wear glasses anymore, but contacts are too drying for me to wear. The only thing I haven't tried in terms of contacts is daily one time use lenses -- has anyone had success with those? Or does anyone know of alternative vision repair methods other than lasik?"
"Is being super sensitive to onions common among us? I would figure that it's because of the micro-scarring on the cornea, or because of the dryness generally, but it could also just be that I am super sensitive as an individual."
"Hi,"

"My eyes are dry frequently and have been tearing lately (which oddly enough can signal dry eye for me- I know, weird). Earlier today I Sat up, looked at the computer, and my vision was suddenly blurry close up. This has never been a problem for me before. I am adding artificial tears now and it seems to be getting a little better. Has this happened to anyone else?"
The paper talks about the lack of attention given small-fiber neuropathy by rheumatologists when it may be at the core of  known SS symptoms.
"Hello everyone. I'm 20 years old, I've been diagnosed sjogren syndrome when I was 12. Right now I'm a student and there are days that I just can't live like a normal person because I feel extremely tired. This situation makes me upset because my degree requires a lot of study, effort and sometimes I just can't study because of my condition. What can I do to feel better? I can't waste days."

"Hi folks,"

"Are any of you experiencing ear symptoms (constant ear discharge, fullness, and crunching noises)?"

"Sensitive teeth, too sensitive to brush sometimes?"

Any remedies you've come up with?
"Like the title says, I (29F) was diagnosed last week. I believe I've had this for years, however, because that's how long I've had certain symptoms.  It's amazing to have a diagnosis and be able to say ""okay, this is WHY this is happening."" But my doctor's suggestions are just to treat the symptoms as they come with OTC products like eye drops, throat lozenges and biotene products."

"The problem I am having is I am not sure what to do/get to address three of the most persistent, day-ruining symptoms I deal with every day without fail."

"1) My scalp itches!!! I only wash my hair twice a week. I also have Hashimotos, which leads to brittle hair, so I am careful about water temp, using gentle shampoos and not shampooing too often. However, my scalp has itched like I had lice or something for months now (don't worry, I for sure don't have lice haha). I've used head and shoulders shampoo, hair and scalp masks, exfoliating my scalp etc etc etc. There's no dandruff-- I'm not shedding skin. And there's no visible redness-- I check because I also have eczema and I need to make sure what is causing the itch and it's definitely not eczema. Has anyone found any solution?"

"2) I have tried all sorts of lotions--- from regular bath and body works stuff, to non scented gentle lotions and baby lotion, to medicated lotions, and still my skin is super dry. This happens particularly around any joints--- behind and to the side of my knees, my elbows, my ankles, my shoulders. Nothing seems to work. I even tried vaseline and just ended up a greasy mess."

"3) My mouth isn't just getting dry--what saliva I do have is getting thick and very mucusy. It attaches to my throat and creates little bubbles of air and sometimes seals off my sinus passages. It's almost impossible to dislodge from coughing because it sticks like glue but when I DO manage to cough something out, it's completely clear but very viscous in texture. Sometimes, it will happen so suddenly that it will make me gag. I almost threw up in my car today, and I DID throw up a few days ago because of it. There is no actual sinus drain to speak of, no stuffy nose, so it's not sinus drain/snot/phlegm. I've tried biotene and while that works while I have an actual dry mouth, when I have this weird thickness in the back, the biotene seems to bond with it and make it thicker. It's weird and gross."

4) An abundance of Tonsil stones that aggravate my throat and a dry cough that has been going on for years. What helps prevent these??

"Sorry, I know it's a lot of questions but I didn't want to make several posts. If anyone has any advice I'd love to have it!"
"Last year I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis after dealing with horrible pain, stiffness and fatigue. About a week before I was finally diagnosed, it became impossible to see in the sunlight. My eyes would involuntarily close and start gushing water. Also, my sinuses and mouth dry up often - they both feel constricted, which makes it very difficult to speak clearly (I'm in sales, so this part really sucks). My fingers have also been turning ice cold for no apparent reason, though I have no idea if it's related."

"My rheumatologist tested me for lupus, which he said came back negative. The ophthalmologist couldn't find any inflammation in my eyes, and said she couldn't see any dry eye. My doctor told me that lupus and Sjogren's Syndrome are not connected to psoriatic arthritis. Yet, I've continued to have these symptoms for months, no matter how much water I drink or Biotene or Saline I use.  If anything I feel like it's getting worse. The other night I had a random, firm lump show up under my tongue, which disappeared a few minutes later. According to the Google this can happen because of dry mouth."

"I trust my doc, but I finally decided to post here today after getting a random text message from my mom. Turns out she got diagnosed with Sjogren's today based on her blood work. She doesn't have any other autoimmune disease. It just seems too coincidental that I have the same symptoms she did."

Is anyone out there dealing with psoriatic issues on top of Sjogren's?
Does anyone here have sjogrens without dryness issues?

I am currently going through the diagnostic process but currently do not suffer from dry eyes / mouth etc...

Currently Sjogrens is the likely culprit in my rheumatologist eyes. Interested in seeing other peoples experiences.
"I have not been officially diagnosed but I have some symptoms: dry mouth, inflamed salivary glands, dry eyes, fatigue. I went in for a vision test today for glasses and the Dr. said that the optic nerve in my left eye is inflamed. This is common in people with glaucoma,  which my elderly dad has, but a google search with Sjögrens showed that it also occurs with this disease too. Any one else have the same issue?"

Thanks in advance.
"I saw my rheum for the first time last fall for achiness, severe fatigue, dry eyes/skin, neuropathy, etc. Blood tests all came back normal except for CRP, which was sky-high, so rheum says I have ""something"" going on for sure, but no definitive diagnosis. Prime suspects are RA and/or Sjogrens.  Been on Plaquenil since then."

&#x200B;

"Anyway, I've noticed a very strange pattern in my mouth and I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this?"


"The back of my mouth and tongue always feel dry, but the front has plenty of saliva. It change right at the point of that ridge behind the teeth. It's very strange to have one part of my mouth feel parched and then the tip of my tongue and teeth are totally fine. I always wonder if I'm imagining it, but every time I stop and check, it feels the same."
"Hey guys! I'm a 33 year old female. I've been having ridiculous dry eye symptoms coupled with eyelids that are dry, swollen, and thick. My OD is treating the symptoms, but keeps asking me if I have dry mouth or am achy--she's relentless about those questions, making me think she suspects that it's not just eye-related. I honestly don't know if I have dry mouth or not because I usually drink about 120 ounces of water a day (because it's good for you) and work out 5 days a week (so I don't know if I'm achy or not because I always feel stiff (painfully stuff), especially when I get up in the middle of the night and when I first wake up). The eyelid swelling and heaviness seem to be most bothersome in the morning and evenings--this morning my eyelids would barely open and close because my eye was so dry--like sandy almost--it's like my eyes just want to close."

"I do have many other symptoms of Sjogrens: the front of my neck  has been very dry and wrinkly, I have a few swollen lymph nodes in my neck that have been evaluated by an ENT (He wasn't concerned with them as far as his soeciality goes.), increased heartburn (I've been taking SO many times), and my lips are always dry, cracked, and flaky."

"My mother has a rhumatoid autoimmune disorder, which I know puts me at a higher risk of developing one myself."

"I'm not a hypochondriac, so I don't really try to be an internet doctor and diagnose myself... Because all of ""symptoms"" could very well be unrelated. The thing that is absolutely driving me insane is my eyes!!!"

What made you guys decide that maybe Sjogrens is something that you should really think about and pursue testing for?
"Hi,"
"I have dryness of mouth, dryness in eyes, fatigue, joint pains, palpitations and high heart rate."
"Eye doctor measured tear flow by Schirmer's test and it was 2mm only, very dry."
Ana Elisa- Negative
"SSa, SSb- Negative"
"ANA immnofloresence- positive, 1:320, speckled pattern."
ANA LIA- all antibodies negative
Rheumatologist doesnt believe its Sjogrens and thinks it is fibromyalgia.
He suggested lip biopsy but I am afraid as someone here said it can cause permanent nerve damage.
"Should I go for it? Also, do u guys get achy and itchy eyes on waking up and sleepiness during the day?"
So two years ago my mother was diagnosed with sjogrens. Lately it has been really bad where she lays in bed all day and cries. She sees a dr but I don’t think it’s helping. Please could someone give me some advice on how to help her?
"I'm in my mid-20s. I've had pSS for 4 years. While the dry eye and mouth were annoying, it was the systemic pain that was my major problem. Flares on and off. Now the dryness has gotten so bad, particularily in the eyes. It feels like someone is throwing sand in my face. When I step outside I can feel the wind on my eyeballs. I can feel and HEAR my eyelids runng across the surface of my eye. It's hell, but I'm sure you understand."

&#x200B;

"I've never experienced a true flare with my dryness, it was just slowly going downhill. I guess I just wanted to know if anybody has flares of dryness. I'm just so scared that this is it, and my eyes will always be this way.  I'm terrified of damaging my cornea. GP and optician are all out of ideas. I've been refered to an opthamologist but that will be another 3 months at least. Has anybody tried Lacrisert? It looks really promising and has good reviews, but it's not available in my country."

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening.
Would it be frowned upon to bring a basic list of health issues I'm dealing with to my doctor?

"It's not super detailed, mainly just have it so I can keep track of when things start occurring and sometimes frequency. I thought that in the event that I finally see a doctor (had bad experiences with them not taking me seriously in the past so I've not gone to one in years) I'll be able to remember everything I wanted to bring up because I have a poor memory as of late. Will I be treated like a hypochondriac for this?"

Off the top of my head  what I'm experiencing (some going on for years now):

* Dryness (eyes/mouth/skin/inside nose)
* Fatigue & poor memory
* Joint pain & muscle soreness
* Interstitial Cystitis
* Allodynia
* Bowel problems (very occasional steatorrhea)
* Soreness under the ribs/upper abdomen
* Heartburn/indigestion
* Weakness in one finger
* Heart palpitations
"Recently I’ve noticed how dry my skin is. Plus, I wake up in the middle of the night with dry mouth, nose, and eyes. I’m thinking a humidifier might help aid in some relief. Any brands or models of humidifiers you absolutely love and doesn’t break the bank? Please let me know!"
"My doctor wants me to start taking Plaquenil. What does this do, what are the side affects, what could happen if I didn’t take it?"
"Just received blood work and my ANA level is through the roof.  I have been chasing a diagnosis on chronic right side submandular gland, sublingual gland and right side throat pain.  Glands are slightly swollen, and we thought it might be a malignancy, however the soft tissue CT scans come back negative....there have been no tissue biopsy done other than the doctor thought it was my right tonsil so he removed it...biopsy returned negative.  That surgery did not help, now the pain is worse.  Staying off caffeine dramatically improves the pain, as well as staying away from Norco pain medication (I think it causes dehydration, and therefore when I come off of it, I not only feel the pain, but its magnified due to the dehydration).  I have recently picked up a Juul vape, and that seems to assist with some discomfort, as well as satisfies my morning pick-me-up in lieu of coffee, and like coffee gets the bowels moving immediately.  Anyhow, on to the question....does anyone suffer from gland pain on one side of the face/jaw area here?  If so, have you found a magic bullet to alive some of the chronic discomfort?"
"Hi folks,"

I hope everyone who is reading this is doing swell and is happy.

"50 year old female. Diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome on June 25, 2018. I've completed my first full month dosage of plaquenile and I've drastically changed my diet. My Rheumatologist said I didn't have to have a special diet nor did I need to eliminate anything from my diet; however, after reading online and more about autoimmune disorders, it seemed prudent to do so. Right now, I'm avoiding all sugar, gluten, nightshades vegetables and caffeine."

"Of course, my fatigue is overwhelming most days and only slightly debilitating on others."

I also have low Vitamin D and I'm taking a 20k international units of Vitamin D along with a k2 supplement.

How are you combating the fatigue without caffeine?

Anyone else on a autoimmune diet even though their doc may not have recommended it?

Any good supplement routines you recommend?

Friend says I should go completely vegan... thoughts?

Thanks for any and all responses.

hotpoot
Has anyone else been told that trauma may have triggered their SS to start? My symptoms began immediately after a traumatic event and Dr suggested a correlation. Stress also seems to affect flares.
"I slept 10 hours, and then went back to bed twice for two more naps, returning to bed at the normal time."

Is this the sign of things to come? Jfc
"I know this sounds weird, but I've been feeling so dry lately that I've been fantasizing about some kind of super-hydrating bath. Maybe something that could be added to bathwater so that instead of drying my skin out once I dry the water off, it's actually moisturized me instead, as if I've covered my entire body in lotion (that actually sank in and didn't just sit on my persistent layer of dried-out skin and not do anything)  Ugh!"

Does this ring a bell to anyone at all? Is there a way this can be done?

Also...if there is...is there something similar for your eyes? My eyes have been SO dry lately. I've been thinking about duct taping some swim goggles full of cheap eye drops to my face at night.

"I think I've got my mouth mostly figured out...Biotene, lubricating mouth drops, letting ice dissolve in my mouth, gum, and tea have helped a lot."

"I know I sound desperate, but I'm sure you've all been there."
"Hi - I've been reading medical research on Sjogren's for the past 2.5 years to help my wife who has salivary gland destruction, neuropathic pain, RF+, SSA and SSB presenting, etc."


&nbsp;

"I think MMP9 is the link between the pathologies, and I believe MMP9 dysregulation can be accomplished by a variety of pathogens, injuries and possibly drugs, and is the cornerstone of Sjogren's dysregulation. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818099 (among many others, and all links hereafter just to illustrate the point, not be a definitive study - I'm not going to footnote every article that got me here)."

"I don't believe MMP9 causes RA, Atherosclerosis or Depression, but it may be what activates these diseases for Sjogren's patients (i.e. a variety of causes for those diseases).  I believe MMP9 starts the inflammatory cascade that results in the substantial dysregulation of the immune system (increased IL-6, increased CRP, increased BAFF, increased CXCL5, b12 deficiency, decreased Mucin production, etc) which result in salivary and acinar glad destruction."

&nbsp;

"The main phenotype for Sjogren's is post-menopausal women; I propose for this cohort it is Estrogen reduction that results in persistent MMP9 elevation, as Estrogen represses MMP9 activation.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668239  Vitamin D deficiency also elevates MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12454321 so Vitamin D-deficient, post-menopausal women might be doubling-down.  A high-fat diet also increases MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935427 so it could be that any combination that brings MMP9 levels above a critical point induces the persistent dysregulation found in Sjogren's.  All 3 combined would be fairly common among American women."

&nbsp;


"In my wife's case, she is Vitamin D deficient but not post-menopausal; she only has oral mucosal involvement with no ocular presentation really.  Enamel defects that leave her susceptible to cavities and periodontitis; for her I propose P. Gingivalis which upregulates and cleaves MMP9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939075/.  P. Gingivalis also rewires Toll-Like Receptor responses, leading to neutrophils stuck in an inflammatory state: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4071223/, and P. Gingivalis neutrophils are impervious to IL-10 induced apoptosis, allowing them to survive longer: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308905/pdf/0650.pdf In addition, P. Gingivalis-primed macrophages promote Tolerance mechanism, unlike naive or tnf-a co-stimulated: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158629"

&nbsp;


"For non-post-menopausal, with involvement in ocular (and/or oral presentation) I propose HSV1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873454"
or P. Aeruginosa https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16384971

"I'd be very curious to hear from any researchers or doctors out there.  We've found DHA Extra Nordic Natural fish oil has helped here (1-2g/day for dryness) and Berberine (gastric motility, mood, fatigue issues, as Berberine inhibits MMP9), and she takes Plaquinil and 5mg Prednisone daily for disease maintenance."

I recently left a 40 hour a week position because the fatigue was too much. I'm worried that I won't be able to truly work full time again without exhausting myself to death. I'm only in my 20s! This shouldn't be! Does it get any easier? How have you balanced your work schedule?
"I just came across this article, [13 Types of Sjogren's Fatigue](http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/bid/342548/13-Types-of-Sjogren-s-Fatigue) and had to share. I think it's a really awesome explanation on the types of fatigue, very validating!"
Anyone have the following and have suggestions for how to improve it?

"I have all the usual Sjögren’s symptoms (plus ankylosing spondylitis) but the one messing up my life is this strange mix of vertigo/lack of depth perception/dizziness/headache/lack of hand-eye coordination. Basically, at times I feel like I’m not sure where my feet are in relation to the floor (like getting off a boat but without the sense of motion), I feel like there is a tight band around my forehead, I can’t judge distance (I try to grab things and miss; have broken quite a few drinking glasses, error rate through the roof when typing)... I find myself not focusing my vision, I feel like I’m only half awake all of the sudden (clumsy but also poor judgement and just slow to think/react because doing anything makes it worse, so I just shut down)...Even when I’m sitting down and haven’t moved in an hour I sometimes suddenly feel like  I have motion sickness, but it’s not really nausea as much as just suddenly feeling really off balance.  (Inner ear tests fine). It’s gotten bad enough that I’m not really functioning. There are times I spend most of the day just sitting because I don’t want to move at all.  Sometime it lasts fifteen minutes, sometimes it will all day for several days in a row."

"Usually I can’t tell what triggers it, but known triggers are:"
"1) drinking cool or cold water = most common trigger (hot water or flavored drinks are usually okay; any icy drinks could trigger it.  I feel like drinks with electrolytes actually help mitigate it.). I should probably just not drink cold water anymore, but cool water is so delicious..."
2) getting dehydrated
"3) any sort of exercise that gets my heart rate up at all, even just walking a block."
"4) getting scared or nervous (again, anything that gets the heart rate up...)"
5) sometimes eating will immediately trigger it; sometimes skipping a meal will
6) pain flare ups usually trigger it.

"It seems to me like maybe an electrolyte issue but no sign of problems in my bloodwork.  Like most Americans, I eat plenty of salt and am almost always careful to stay well hydrated.  Doctor thinks it might be migraines (I have gotten sparkly vision a few times, but rarely), but since it started at the same time as the Sjögren’s, I feel like it’s more likely to be something Sjögren’s related.  Migraine meds don’t seem to be doing much at all."
"The sharp burning intense pain and prickling has gone from my legs, thighs, and is now up my forearms on the palm side of you understand me.  It is terrible and nobody can help me.  I'm getting some rashes on arms and skin indentations."

I'm getting no support.
"Hi, folks.  Recent Sjogren's diagnosis."
"The nutritionist put me on 2000 mg fish oil.  Nordic Naturals.  5 wks later, I had the first of 3 bleeding gum incidents.  I've stopped the fish oil to see if I'll have any more incidents."
"I've read that large doses of fish oil can cause blood thinning issues, but this seems like a standard dose.  Any thoughts?"
"Hey, not sure if this type of post is allowed or not but here ya go"

"My girlfriend of 7 years, whom I live with, was diagnosed with Sjogrens earlier this year after two long and hard years of mysterious symptoms. Doctors are still trying to figure out the best treatment plan for her, as well as determine if she additionally has other autoimmune or neurological issues. All of her symptoms have been pretty debilitating and continue to get worse. We are doing everything in our power to get her healthy again as best as we know how."

"But it's been especially tough on her mentally. From doctors not knowing what Sjogrens even is, to doctors telling her she is lying, to friends not understanding when we have to cancel plans, to her not being able to keep a stable job due to frequent flare ups. The list goes on and on."

"We recently discovered there is a Walk for Sjogren’s nearby to raise money for the Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation. We had never heard of this before, but we are getting involved both to meet other people who suffer from the same illness and to raise money to help bring more awareness to Sjogren’s and help with research. Having been through the diagnosis process with my S.O. firsthand, it’s mind blowing how it takes 2-3 years on average for people to get diagnosed with this properly."

"Anyway, my question is: does anyone have any experience with these types of walks or with the Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation? Is it a legit foundation and will money raised actually go somewhere useful?"

"My girlfriend is really struggling because she feels like so many people don’t understand or care. We are doing the walk with her close (but small) family. But outside of our little circle, a lot of our friends, colleagues, neighbors don’t really seem to care and aren’t showing her much support. And I am not talking about donations - even just moral support. It would mean the world if anyone could at least just write some kind words of advise on here for her. I just want the best for her, and overcoming the mental aspects of her life-changing illness has proven difficult."

Thanks all
"My mother (54) was diagnosed blast fall and is having a very hard time dealing with her new changes in her life. She was always a busy body, and was so capable of taking care of everything in day to day life, and is now struggling with all of this falling down on her. Do you all have any advice or caring words to help her try to deal with this? I wouldn't normally ask anybody but today she just stayed on the couch crying all day and after visiting with her she is saying she just doesn't know what to do... I'm glad I found all of you and everyone seems so wonderful. I appreciate any help or good words of wisdom you all can provide."
"Hi all. I tested positive for Sjogrens B about 5 years ago, but we were never able to catch it again until I had a bad flare this summer."

I still have a week to go to see my rheumatologist because they have coded me as a new patient since it's been so long.

"I have this eczema that the dermatologist just hasn't had any success treating. About half of my foot is covered and I can only tolerate ballet flats. He believes it is autoimmune. I also have patches of what he called ""discoid eczema"" on my leg that just scars and resurfaces basically every time I shave my legs."

"Has anyone had problems with eczema? It's not ringworm, nor any other type of fungal infection. We checked for that. Its in patches on my scalp, my forearm, and my leg and foot. I try not to scratch it, but the itching is so bad that I wake up at night. The only thing that seems to soothe it for even a small window is A&D ointment, but it's still spreading. It's been three months at least. I need relief!"

"My vitamin D had also bottomed out and was so low that the doctor said he was surprised it even showed up on the lab work. So I'm taking a multivitamin plus additional vitamin D. It's helped my energy levels and with the hair loss, but the eczema is still steadily making it's way across my foot."
"Anyone ever have this happen? Diagnosed 4 years ago, symptoms for 10+ but I’ve never had this happen until last week."

"My leg had an altercation with an unhappy wolf spider last week. The bite got very red and swollen the first day, but then I started getting joint pain near the bite, then eventually everywhere. The bite got better but by the end of the second day I was in a full flare up with pain, dryer than usual eyes/mouth, etc you all know the drill."

I thought maybe it was a coincidence and something else triggered it but I got bit by something again last night and the same thing is starting up. Small bite on my shoulder last night. Bite looks fine today but all the joints from my neck to my fingers on that side ache like flare up joint pain.

(I don’t know where all the bugs are coming from or why they are so mad at me.)

I’m going to try and ask the doctor but it could be months before they get me in. Just curious if anyone else has had the same thing happen.

"I went to my GP at the end of last week, explained my symptoms, but I never mentioned Sjogren's....I didn't want to direct the testing. I'd rather just let her test for whatever she saw fit. She told me that she wanted to do labs for ANA, SSA and B, RA, and a ton of other things. I received a call from her office yesterday saying: ""Your ANA is positive and you have Sjogren's. We're going to refer you to a Rheumatologist for a further work up and treatment."" I was in shock, because I didn't expect to get any answers....I knew that Sjogren's was a possibility, but I just really didn't think that I'd test positive for it. I was caught off guard, so I didn't think to ask if I was SSA or SSB positive, but I'm assuming one was because of the ""...and you have Sjogren's"" statement.  (I should be able to see my lab results online by the end of the week.)"

"I'm waiting to hear back regarding the Rheumatologist referral. I guess my real question is: are more tests, like the lip biopsy, typically necessary for treatment to occur or is that only necessary if the SSA or SSB are negative?"

Thank you guys for all of your help!!
"I woke up today and as always, had to feel my way to the bathroom because my eyes were dried shut.  Came back to bed for my usual routine of Advil and eye drops. With my eyes pretty much closed, I grabbed what I thought was my eye drop bottle, pried my eyes open enough to squeeze the drops in, and squirted decongestant spray in my right eye!  I blinked a few times and realized this stuff was really watery, and my eye lid had opened right away. Then I realized I had grabbed the wrong bottle off my cluttered nightstand.  You know, it worked better than my Systane drops!  I was able to compare things after I put my regular ""optimal dry eye"" drops in my left eye."

"Okay, that paragraph took a while as I waited to be able to see.  No real side effects at this time.  No pain, and that eye actually feels better than my other eye, as in I can see more clearly without as much cloudiness.  The eye does feel a little numb but that's all.  I will see what happens I guess!"

"But it does make me wonder how if a plain sterile saline solution would work, especially in the morning when you really want to get your eyes open quickly.  I'll do some research but in the meantime, what tricks do any of you with morning dry eye have?  (Don't use nasal spray, it was an accident and I won't use it again!)"
What do y’all do about dry itchy ears? Vaseline?
Good evening I was wondering how people felt after surgery. I have to get my gallbladder removed because it’s not functioning properly and I was wondering how people felt after surgery?
"My husband has struggled to eat for the past month. He says it feels like someone is putting a knife through his gland (in front of the ear). ENT said he doesn't see much saliva coming out of that gland. They did a CT, and it doesn't show anything other than swollen lymph nodes. No stones or anything."

"He has a few Sjogrens hallmarks - existing autoimmune disease (T1D), dry mouth, geographic tongue, dry stomach. He doesn't have much trouble with his eyes that he can tell."

"Honestly, I don't even know what to do. It's impossible to get him to eat because of the pain, and his blood sugars are so low. He's already massaging it, but he has given up on sour candies after a week of excruciating pain with no relief in symptoms."

He's tried 2 rounds of antibiotics. No doctor involved has brought up Sjogrens.

"Help! This has been going on for a month, and I'm so worried!"
"Increased urine frequency, pain etc"
"Dear all,"
"I'm currently trying to get a diagnosis for Sjogren's. I have all the symptoms plus genetic testing on 23andme showed increased risk. My ANA and RF are fine, SS-A and SS-B should be tested soon."
Does anyone happen to know more about the Sjö™️ Test? It seems you can get it done at an ophthalmologist to test for some novel biomarkers in case it's too early for standard markers. Is the test only available in the US or also in overseas markets (Europe)? I can't seem to find any information on the Bausch + Lomb website.
And has anyone tested positive for those new biomarker only?
Thanks for any inputs
"Ever since I realized that I have a dry mouth, I also kept getting clear mucoceles all around my mouth, the roof, back of mouth, under my tongue and under my upper lip. I guess they are blocked salivary glands."

Does anyone here suffer with this?
"I was just wondering if anyone has experienced numbness in only one of their fingers? For 5 days now my pinky finger has been numb, and its causing problems when holding objects or doing simple tasks since its my dominant hand. A can fell off of the shelf yesterday and hit my finger and all that I felt was a intense pins and needle feeling."

"I had a flare up, seemed to be sjogrens related but it could be a mix of one of the other auto immune diseases that I have. I think I over did it on memorial day, it was the first full day that I was able to spend outdoors with the family but I paid for it the very next day. I didn't do anything extreme but the sun and the heat have always been killers for me. I woke up on Tuesday and my face was swollen, one gland felt like it was on fire, I had a fever that would come and go with follow up chills , all around joint pain, my mouth was somehow dryer which I didn't think was possible, and I slept for 40 hours total the first 2 days. The swelling went down on Wednesday but the numbness was still there and has stayed constant each day.  I have an appointment with my gp at the end of this week.  I was just wondering if there was anything I could do until then to help relieve some of the symptoms? I wasn't sure if I should go to the drug store and purchase a wrap or a brace since its just in my finger.  My arm is sore but I think that's just from how I have had to adjust to use my hand."

Any feedback is appreciated!
Been recently diagnosed with Sjögren . I don’t know anyone who has  this so its really hard for me to talk to anyone about how I feel there are days I feel great other days I just want to stay in bed because I feel so fatigue and my body feels like  it’s burning  .
And I feel like I'm just getting worse.

Ive had symptoms that I wrote off for years until I was getting joint pain in my fingers and hands then toes and feet. Went to my PCP in February then saw a rheumatologist a few weeks later. Was officially diagnosis through blood test with sjogrens about a month and a half ago. Prescribed plaquenil 200mg per day.

"Though I've had really good days, some discomfort and tiredness but I was feeling better."

"But the last few weeks I've been plagued with problems. Swelling painful knees, with lumps of fluid (like bagged milk) and noticable swelling in my calf. Joint pain off and on."

"But the worse started a couple days ago, I feel like I have the flu in some extent. A crushing headache that will not go away no matter what I take. Now a fever, feeling freezing just to be burning up 2 hours later. Joint pain in my foot making it difficult to walk. And a stiff neck and shoulders. Pretty much even laying in bed I'm miserable."

I have a follow up appointment with my rheumatologist next Thursday. I'm just wondering has anybody gotten worse before they got better?
"I'd like to begin with a disclaimer. I haven't been officially diagnosed with Sjogrens, but I have been seeing a rheumatologist and dealing with mild symptoms for about 8 years."

"Currently I am struggling with staying active because I feel drained all the time. I have a young son and feel like I need to reserve all my energy to keep up with him. I also prefer to workout in the morning but have been waking up stiff and achy. Hoping with the end of the spring semester coming up, I will have more time to workout during the afternoon."

Does anyone have any tips or tricks? I am okay with going on walks but would really like to include some strength training and other forms of low impact cardio. I don't have access to a pool. I feel better when I am working out but I can't seem to get out of this latest flare up that has had me down for 3 weeks.
Hello 👋

"We originally thought I was suffering from Sjögren Syndrome since I check all the boxes, however the auto-immune test were negative so the rheumatologist concluded I suffer from a non-immunological Sicca Syndrome. It’s been 6 months now and in the meantime I’ve been screened for neurological disorders (everything is normal minus the neuropathic pain and tremor which I’m taking Lyrica for, I have to see a neuro-ophtalmologist for the eye problem unrelated to Sicca). The neurologist I saw last week still think the answer is a systemic or metabolic disorder and I’m planning to go see an internist doctor (diagnosis experts)."

"Does it remind you of something you could have heard or read? I’ve searched online and apparently some people were diagnosed with Sjögren solely on symptoms even though the ANA, SSA and SSB test and the lip biopsy were normal so 🤷‍♀️"
"Hi group,"

"My rheumy wants me to have a lip biopsy. I consulted with the ENT she recommended, and he terrified me with warnings re scarring and risk of permanent numbness. I would be grateful to hear your stories, positive or negative. Kindly include who did the procedure for you—ENT or plastic surgeon? Etc?"

Thank you!!!
"Does anyone have any suggestions to working out? I’m attempting to take a big certification in a little over a year and well there is no info anywhere! Has anyone noticed that perhaps yoga, Pilates, swimming etc has helped them? Thanks"

"Hey, all. New to this subreddit, and recently diagnosed with Sjögren's, though I've been experiencing symptoms for nearly ten years. I saw my rheumatologist for the first time on Tuesday, and we're waiting for all my labs to come back, but based on what she's seen so far she already asked me to bump my 6-month recheck to 3 months."

"I think, on the whole, that I have a mild strain of Sjögren's, at least in terms of symptoms. My biggest issues have been mild dry mouth (which, coupled with long-undiagnosed bruxism, has led to a lot of dental problems), fatigue, and dry eyes. The thing that made me think I might have Sjögren's in the first place is that when I cry, I don't actually produce tears. I haven't cried for ten years."

"So, when I got my official diagnosis and she told me it was chronic, I lost it, breaking down into my sad tearless crying. Besides all the scariness that is autoimmune in general, the increased risk for lymphoma, and other potential nastiness, I am absolutely *devastated* by the thought of never crying again. I'm an emotional person, and right now am also clinically depressed. I have absolutely ached for the catharsis that comes with crying these past ten years. I just can't imagine never having this very basic, very necessary human experience again."

"All things told, it is a small thing, and my Sjögren's could be treating me much worse. And who knows, maybe it will. But in the meantime I'm having a hard time coming to terms with this."
"I was diagnosed with SS based on the presence of “early detection antibodies.” I have had nerve, joint, and muscle pain for about 6 months but I don’t really have dry mouth or eyes. Do those symptoms always have to be present for a diagnosis?"

I also don’t understand much about these “early detection antibodies.” Has anyone else had a diagnosis based on these?

Thank you for any input!
"I'm 46, female, diagnosed a year ago with Sjogren's and Fibromyalgia. I've always struggled eating anything with chilli in it, in fact anything spicy.  My mouth and tongue burn and feel like needles are sticking in it. It lasts 20 minutes at least"
"I'm wondering if it's just me not digging the spicy food,  or is Sjogren's the culprit?"
Medications: Plaquenil 200mg; Cymbalta 120mg; LDN 6mg; CBD Oil one drop (20%)

Thanks in advance fellow redditers

"So I just got diagnosed with Sjogren’s a few months ago and I’m more of naturalist I hate taking pretty much anything my doctor has thrown at me, because frankly I hate how I feel taking anything. So my question is what kinds of things do you guys do to ease your symptoms other then medications? Eye drops? Mouthwashes? Anything for Fatigue?"
"Hi - I recently received a brief phone call from my estranged mother wherein she told me I had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder as a child (and might want to go see a doctor). She told me it was ""Tsorgen's"" and after a bit of research here I am."
"The dry mouth, splitting eye pain in sunlight, and so on were immediately recognizable symptoms that I struggle with in day to day life - but there was another symptom that I noticed as well: the dreaded ""mental fog."""

"I get fatigued very easily, and it's hard to stay on task - I had always figured I had ADD or some such, but perhaps there's an alternate explanation."

"Does anyone else have experience with this? Particularly, experience with what can be done to stymie it? I've been taking vitamins, fish oil, and so on lately, which have been enormously helpful with my joints (especially my jaw), but perhaps there are other options as well."

"I've made a doctor's appointment and so on - hopefully they'll be able to set me straight, or refer me to a specialist."

"Any input is appreciated, thanks."
"Please know how crucial fluid is in summer heat to anyone with a diagnosis of Sjögren’s. Speaking from painful experience, the consequences far outweigh the inconvenience of having to carry a water bottle nonstop. Drink. Drink. Drink."
[Here's an article about the LO2A progress to date.](https://www.healio.com/ophthalmology/cornea-external-disease/news/online/%7B3c3dbf1d-182c-457a-8b11-c880b28b28e1%7D/wizes-lo2a-shows-positive-results-in-sjgrens-related-dry-eye)
My eyes are so dry they hurt so bad i want to cry. what helps you? eye drops only work for maybe 10-120 minutes and then its back to feeling like some filled a hot leaf blower with sand and is blowing 2 inches away from my face.
"This year around June, my wife started feeling extremely tired. It seemed like no matter how much she slept she could not get over it. She lived with it for a little bit but then started noticing that she had swollen lymph nodes on her neck.  She didn't have a primary doctor at the time so she just got one that seemed close and had a few positive reviews.  The doctor was a nightmare.  Basically passed her off to a surgeon who biopsied the lymph nodes but couldn't find anything. Basically both of them said her problems were in her head.  At this point though, she started having extreme stomach pain. Especially if she ate certain foods."

"She got a recommendation from a friend to go see a gastroenterologist who recommended she go to a rheumatologist (at first was gonna make her wait 2 months before seeing her but got lucky and there was a cancellation) . That person then asked her if she had gotten a lot of cavities lately.  She had just started going to the dentist this year after a long period of having no dental insurance. She had 10 cavities.... With this info, the doctor decided she probably had Sjogrens.They did the tests but made her wait a month before discussing the results. In the meantime they got her on those anti malarial drugs and the anti dryness drug."

"Well during that time, the gastroenterologist finally got her in to do a endoscopy. They found that she had h. pylori.  She had been tested a couple of times prior (i forgot to mention) but no one had found it those times."

"Then just last week after all this waiting and jumping around from doctor to doctor, they finally gave her the verdict that she indeed has SSA + Sjogrens.  Although the doctor was great in diagnosing her, they didn't really give her any advice or comfort, they just gave her a print out from that Sjogrens foundation site and sent her on her way."

"Anywho, that's the story.  Did you guys have to go through the same amount of bullshit? What was the best advice you guys have gotten with dealing with the condition?"
"How is it people say they have no energy, but they do stuff anyways? I wish I could do stuff anyways, but when my energy is depleted I turn into rag doll. I can't get the dishes done. I can't work a full time job. Hell, my part time job just went up one hour a day and I'm having a hell of a time hanging in there. I sleep 10 hours a night and need a two hour nap after work."

"A vegan diet used to help, but I feel worse as the weeks go by no matter what. I'm a ball of complaints and cancelled plans. I can't do what I used to do (10 hour/day job with tons of walking and then a social life, imagine that! It seems so far away now)"

"Last weekend my husband had some friends over to build a gazebo and it was too hot for me to even go outside and pretend to help, but I did and do you know what happened? I felt incredibly sick that night- nausea, joint pain, fatigue, cloudy thoughts, diarrhea. That's what happens if I try to 'power through it'. It's fantastically annoying."

I miss my energy. I miss me. Will I really never be the same again? Are these past 5 months a preview of the rest of my life's course? That's depressing as fuck.

Thanks for listening to my rant.

"I was just diagnosed with Sjogrens about two weeks ago. However, I have been battling debilitating fatigue since May in addition to other symptoms. However, the fatigue is significantly disrupting my life. Some websites suggest exercise to help with fatigue. However, other places recommend pacing...what's your experience?"
I've seen another Rheumatologist who says they believe my diagnosis is SS (pending more testing) and unlikely to be fibromyalgia. This is the second time a Rheumatologist has said as much. If it is a singular diagnosis then I'm a bit confused. I didn't know SS could be so damn painful. Is it the systemic inflammation? Arthritis? Like my joints hurt and are stiff. My muscles hurt too. I experience nerve pain as well which is thankfully seldom.
I ask because I will do it and report new developments if nobody else is doing it. I know in the celiac sub there seem to be several people who post about new research so I don't have to be very vigilant myself.
"Update: I just got off the phone and since the price has continued to increase it's now 44/60.  Still better, but not what the same information I had before."



"A few months ago I went to pick up my prescription and instead of 20 dollars it was over 300, without insurance. The pharmacist told me his cost had jumped and he was giving it to me nearly at cost. Yikes! I called around and tried finding it somewhere else and everyone else was more expensive. Eventually I found Needy Meds a clearing house of sorts connecting patients with chairities providing low cost medications. I was able to get three months for 20 dollars, although they recently sent out a letter saying that due to cost increases they were increasing the cost to 20 a month. Anyway here's the link- http://www.needymeds.org/drug_list.taf?_function=name&=name&name=Plaquenil and I've added it to the sidebar."
I absolutely cannot take antidepressants ... They make me nuts and unstable.  I recognize that my depression is situational but what to do when the situation causing it is incurable?

"I was happy to see 2014 go.  I've spent way too much of that year either in bed or at the doctors.  It wasn't all bad.  I did get remarried... to the man of my dreams, my high school sweetheart who is forever patient and supportive even if my main issue is a bad mood.  I was eager to start 2015 and finding new ways to meet my goals of feeling better and being able to do more with my family and try to get back to work."

"Sjogrens sucks.  I never aim to spend my time in bed, but I always end up there.  I mopped my kitchen floor.  It desperately needed it and I couldn't stand feeling useless and it falling to my husband to come home from work only to have do what I can't.  It doesn't seem like much ... simply mopping a floor.  Who doesn't mop their kitchen floor?  With 4 little ones in the house it needs to be done daily but it often gets pushed aside.  Then I can hear my mother as if she's looking at my floor in disapproval saying ""I know you don't feel well but you need to just decide you're going to take care of your business and get it done"".  I love her but she sooo does not get it.  She likes to compare my fatigue with her staying up and hour or 2 later than usually because they had friends over for dinner.  I'd love to have friends over for dinner but not with my dirty kitchen floor!"

"I was determined to start the year with a clean kitchen floor.  It wore me out.  My shoulders swelled and ached. I can deal with that.  I got comfortable and tried to relax with the kids ... the feeling of having a clean kitchen floor beat the misery my body was in.  But then the back pain started.  It was bad.  I soaked in hot bath, took my pain meds and retreated to bed-only it didn't help and I couldn't sleep.  All of sudden at 4 am, I couldn't stop peeing.  3 trips to the bathroom in an hour each time with a bladder that felt like it would burst and on the 4th it hit me.  My urine had been getting darker and darker over that hour.  It didn't concern me at first because I drink a ton of water all day but all of a sudden I couldn't relieve myself.  The back pain instantly worsened and I thought I was going to throw up but then finally relief ... I was able to empty my bladder only to find blood clots had been blocking the flow.  The darkening of my urine was blood and the pain in my back from my kidneys."

"Why would I attribute this to mopping my floor?  Because it happens every time I exert myself.  Only the last time I thoroughly cleaned my house, it was pancreatitis.  Before that it was pneumonia-twice.  And on 5 occasions in 2014, cleaning was immediately followed by shingles.  Not to mention the spontaneous bouts of lactation-that's right...I said lactation.  Only my youngest child is 5 and I've never breast fed so my breasts do not like lactating.  I became engorged and had to buy a breast pump and take antibiotics for a month.  My doctor was speechless."

"I have organ involvement and physical stress makes my immune system angry.  My recent marriage means my insurance has changed and now in the midst of new symptoms-potentially serious, I have no doctor.  Primary doesn't take my new insurance and my rheumatologist unexpectedly closed shop.  I will be out of pain meds by Monday and anyone whose dealt with chronic pain knows that look you get from a doctor who doesn't know you when you say you need a narcotic refill."

"Maybe 2015 will not be my year after all.  It's already adding up to be a year of tests - now including kidneys and undoubtedly, my temper.  I'll be 36 in 2 weeks and my 5 year old daughter is trying to buy my a ""pretty green"" (my favorite color) CANE for my birthday with her Christmas cash.  My kids deserve a better mom; my husband a better wife ... I need a new body and a better attitude.  Anyone know who has them on sale??"

"In all seriousness,  I need a new outlet ... I would appreciate suggestions of what you do when you feel like you can't take anymore.  What leaves you feeling refreshed enough to keep pushing in the right direction?"
Wish I knew what it was like to not feel sick. I have four kids. There's so much more I want to do with them but I am too tired and in pain. I already push myself like crazy just to slap Sjogren's in the face but I still feel so bad and I know the feeling I'm trying to hide still seeps out and sucks the enthusiasm out of anything I try to do.
"Was diagnosed with Sjogrens at 21, about 3 1/2 years ago. I only recently got insurance through the state and all the doctors I've met with have been at a loss as to how to treat it or minimize the effect I try to explain in has on my daily life. I leave feeling like they just think I'm a whiny kid making excuses for my behavior and it's the most frustrating thing ever. At this point, I have no interest in returning to any doctor unless I am sure they truly understand Sjogrens."

"I searched the history and didn't see anything on this question so please link me if I missed something. Basically I have constant aches through my body and am so tired that it's caused problems in my every day functioning. There are some days I am too tired and sore to even get out of bed. I have missed work and school as a result of this. I don't even accomplish half of what I used to a few years ago each day. I go to the store, I feel like I have to sleep for 5 hours. Even waking up and taking a shower is exhausting some days. I'm so sick of feeling this way and it's caused me to become increasingly more depressed, feeling like this is my fault, that I chose this. That I'm lazy.... I feel like everyone I explain this too thinks I am just making up excuses. It's left me feeling defeated and angry. Is this a part of Sjogrens and if so, how do you combat it? Also, any advice on finding a doctor that understands my issues? In the Baltimore area if that matters. Thanks so much."
April is Sjogren's Syndrome Awareness month. My goal is to have a fact a day which may be helpful to share and educate others. I'm not a writer so much of it will be copied or adapted and sourced.


"Day 1- What is Sjogren’s? Sjögren’s (SHOW-grens) syndrome is an autoimmune disease, a disease in which the immune system turns against the body’s own cells. In the case of Sjögren’s syndrome, disease-fighting cells attack various organs, most notably the glands that produce tears and saliva (the lacrimal and salivary glands). Damage to these glands causes a reduction in both the quantity and quality of their secretions. [Source](http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/sjogrens_syndrome/)"

I've been officially diagnosed with full on Sjogren's for 4 months.  I struggle with eye drops not helping.  Genteal said Systane somewhat help.  Soothe single use with no preservatives burns and seems to dry my eyes out more.  Anyone have any suggestions or tips?
I am considering getting the flu shot for the first time but I’m worried it could cause a flare and I haven’t had one in a month.
Doxycycline has proven extremely effective for me in the past. But I'm unable to get a prescription.

I received a preliminary diagnoses from an neuro-ophthalmologist who guessed Sjogren's based on the comment that my symptoms always get better when I take Doxycycline.   I had never heard of Sjogren's at that point.

I can not find any doctor willing to take me seriously on that.  Even with an official Sjogren's diagnoses.

All doctors have refused to give me a prescription for it.

"I've never measured the humidity level in my bedroom before, but I assumed it was pretty dry. I ordered a humidifier, and it indicates that the level of my bedroom is 60% (without turning it on!), which is actually more humid than what is recommended (40-50%), so I guess I should return it? Apparently too much humidity can cause issues as well, so idk. Any advice?"

"What I have noticed though, is that if I set the heater to get 24°C, I get much much drier, which doesn't happen in the summer when it is 24°C ""naturally""."

"I was diagnosed with Sjogren's based on symptoms (swelling in salivary glands, dry eyes, dry mouth) and have taken Plaquenil and Meloxicam for several years now. They helped a lot but when I recently decreased my Plaquenil dose (due to eye concerns), my symptoms got worse. For example, I can chop up onions again without any tears. I just had an ultrasound and they said it is normal and they don't think I have Sjogren's syndrome. Is this possible? Is it all in my head? Is the Plaquenil just a placebo? Am I just a dry person for no reason? Has anyone else had a normal ultrasound?"
"I've read that the damage to our tear and salivary glands happens because lymphocytes (white blood cells) have infiltrated them.  Can the lymphocytes migrate out of the glands once they've moved in?  (Or die without causing a problem, etc.)"
How long did it take for your symptoms to go from noticeable to uncomfortable or dreadful?

"41, F. Discovered positive test results for SS-A, SS-B a year and a half ago while undergoing blood tests looking for arthritis. Turns out no rheumatoid arthritis but I have the Sjogrens antibodies.  I've never had the classic Sjogrens symptoms."

"I'm monitored by a rheumatologist who keeps an eye on my lab results and does twice a year physical exams of joints, eyes, blood pressure etc.   I have some irregular blood tests, but I feel great.  Joints feel fine. I describe myself as having the Sjogrens antibodies but no symptoms."

Or so I thought.

Saw the rheumatologist last week and explained to her that I drink copious amounts of fluids.  6+ litres is a typical day for me.  I used to think that was normal. I told her my mouth doesn't feel dry; I'm just thirsty.  She checked my mouth and chuckled.  Doctor says I do have dry mouth; I just didn't have a frame of reference to compare.

"The other night I was doing some reading and my eyes felt uncomfortable. Usually I chalk it up to fatigue.  Then it struck me that perhaps all along this was the Sjogrens dry eyes symptoms, and I just didn't recognize it."

"I'm wondering if I might be at the start of the descent towards full-blown Sjogrens symptoms.  I have no friends or family members with Sjogrens so Reddit has been my main source of expertise. It sounds like symptoms can be quite debilitating, or at least highly highly uncomfortable. I'm an active healthy person and the thought of not having that lifestyle is worrisome.  Should I anticipate a day soon when crawling out of bed hurts, swallowing is uncomfortable and I can't go anywhere without eyedrops?"

How quickly did your symptoms get worse?
Went to my Rheumatologist today and he told me to stop taking my Plaquenil for 2 weeks to see if my wheezing symptoms are correlated. I've been on it for 3 months now is there any way I'd have like withdrawal symptoms or anything. I know it sounds silly but I'm genuinely wondering.
"Hi, folks."
"Diagnosed with Sjogren's 2+ mos ago.  The main symptom is dry mouth.  Mild eye dryness, too.  ANA, anti-SSA & anti-SSB tests all positive.  Symptom onset was abrupt, after using a new toothpaste."
"I've been on an anti-inflammatory diet (=no sugar, no wheat, very limited dairy and soy) since diagnosis.  Also switched to a gentle toothpaste and using Xylimelts at night, Spry gums and mints during the day.  I'm doing 45 min meditation/day and I've signed up for the 8-week MBSR class."
"Like the headline says, lots of questions."
1.  Can my dry mouth symptoms improve from this point on?  (I've seen some improvement with the anti-inflammatory diet.)
"2.  What about eye dryness?  (My Schirmer's test results were 9mm in one eye, 16mm in the other.  It's not bad at all.)"
3.  Can my blood numbers go back to normal (=negative)?
"4.  Any chance I will go back to feeling normal?  (I can point to the day the symptoms started, so I'm hoping they will resolve and the illness will go into remission.)"

"Finally:  I am looking for hope.  How long until we find a cure?  Would it be a gene therapy thing or something else?  Also, how long until they can repair damage to saliva glands?  (My rheumatologist said, Maybe 10 yrs.)  What about tear gland repair?"

Thanks!
"I hate heat, and love having a fan blowing on me almost always. But, with Sjogren's, I can feel my eyeballs drying out as I enjoy the breeze... Has anyone tried using sealed glasses to keep your peepers from peeling? :D"

"If so, do you have recommendations on what to get? I [found something on Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Pyramex-Safety-Proximity-SB9310ST-Anti-Fog/dp/B01BI8T32S/), but wasn't sure if it'd work. Thanks!"

"I posted earlier this week about my GP calling to confirm that I am ""ANA positive and have Sjogren's"", but was too shocked to ask questions. I received a copy of my lab report and it showed the following:"

"I don’t have insurance, I recently found out that I have Sjogren’s. I live in Texas, and my doctor is waiting to officially diagnosed me because of living in taxes and insurance. If I get diagnosed within six months of getting insurance then it will be considered a pre-existing condition. I need to do something about the dryness. But I wake up with Severe dry eye dry mouth dry nose my throat hurts most of the time. It’s becoming frustrating."

What is the best humidifier for cost?
The best eye drops? I use Xiidra but am about to run out due to insurance issue.
I use biotene but it doesn’t last long and burns a bit lately.
My throat is constantly dry and hurting.
I am have phlegm which I learned was thick saliva.

Any ideas y’all feel like throwing at me I would so appreciate.
I'm 29 and was diagnosed with Sjogren's at 27.

"My optometrist has offered punctal plugs due to my dry eyes. I'm going to talk it over with my rheumy, but do you all think they are a good idea?"

My eyes are very dry but my eyesight is still very good and my eyes are still healthy. I regularly use artificial tears and just discovered Thera Tears which I like even better.

She said there are other options like Restasis which is apparently very expensive and that she prefers to see how the plugs work to save money and hassle.
Or other dry-eye relief?
"(Also, Do those oral eye health/dry eye supplements work?)"

Thank you!

"Edit: thank you everyone for your wonderful ideas and help! I have learned about the importance of preservative-free drops and now I’m also looking into adding a nighttime one. I found some Refresh Omega 3 preservative-free single-use drops at the drugstore yesterday when I was shopping to find what everyone said (but I’ll keep going down the list to ultimately try everything recommended). I put them in several mins ago (one ampoule per eye), and I can seeeeeeeeeee!!! The relief didn’t just instantly vanish like with my old natural tears drops! Still a lil stinging— but maybe that’s because I’m still waking up. YAY!!!!!!!  I’ll come back with more updates! Thank you all!!"
Struggling with pain
"Hey I have only made one post on Reddit before so I don’t quite know how it works yet. I have Sjögren’s Syndrome and fibromyalgia but also it seems something else is amiss as I’m bed bound with pain. I also have terrible insomnia and fatigue. Idk if it’s related but I keep getting horrible rashes across my face, chest, and neck. They burn like crazy! I can’t use any products on my face except cetaphil every 2days, just warm water on a wash rag in between. Any help? I’m already on very high doses of pain medication but I’m not living life, I’m barely surviving."
"What is the severity of your dry mouth and eyes, nose? Do you have days when your mouth feels normal without any drugs."

"I'm confused and have several of the Sjogren's symptoms, my blood was negative. I'm going to look into the lip biopsy. But in the meantime, my eyes and mouth are dry on and off for the last year. Some days I feel very normal with adequate amounts of saliva in my mouth, other days my tongue feels dry and has small cracks in the middle thus leaving me feel that weird dry texture. All in all I always seem to have saliva production happening but they didn't stop me from that dry odd feeling on my tongue."

"Also if these are my symptoms now, is it a guarantee that if I get diagnosed, that my symptoms will get worse over time?"

Love to hear everyone's experience.

"Hi friends,"

Results for my tests came back positive for ssa and negative for ssb. Anyone else have the same results?
"Hello,"

"I am a newbie to this group. I've been having crazy symptoms since last July and drs cant figure out what's going on. I've been diagnosed and undiagnosed with lupus and fibro... but was confirmed I have sjogrens. I have dry mouth and eyes, but I also experience chronic leg pain (feela like  my legs are going to burst, almost like I ran a marathon). I also have tingling and numbness in different parts of my body, but usually on my face. Stress seems to be a huge trigger for me. I also suffer from shortness of breath and lack strength in my arms. My upper arms and hands hurt as well. I also suffer from chronic fatigue. Some days no amount of coffee or energy drink can get me through the day even though i sleep through the night. Do any of you experience similar symptoms to me? I've gone to so many drs and still no answers. I am going crazy."

Edit: all the drs except my new rheumatologist made it seem like sjogrens is nothing to worry about. But my new dr seems concerned. I am not sure how serious sjogrens can get.
"I've decided to start tracking my fevers. They seem to come regularly, maybe a couple of times a month. Previously I could just *feel* a fever set in, but never owned a reliable thermometer. Today I picked up a high end ear canal thermometer to begin logging."

"Recently I had a very bad flare up that caused a lot of serious pain. As it resolved I experienced muscular fatigue, followed by a day of emotional fatigue and depression. Finally, chills and fever set in today. It's not a very high fever, but it is taking a toll on me."


Have any of you had a similar experience? Do we think is my *poorly managed* primary Sjogren's Syndrome?

"Or perhaps, does this sound unusual and likely caused by something else going on in my body (ie. I'm attesting all symptoms to Sjogren's when some of them are caused by something else.)"
"Has anyone found a good product that helps dried out nails and cracking cuticles? I carry cuticle balm but even using it multiple times a day I'm still getting dried out, irritated and peeling. Ditto lip care and chapstick."
I am a 34 years old female who was diagnosed with Sjogrens last year. I haven’t seen a specialist or even a doctor to talk about my autoimmune disease.

When I have flare up  I just bite the bullet and work through it. Taking an ibuprofen when legs are really sore and tired. Having caffeine when I feel so tired and exhausted. Drinking electrolytes when feeling dry... and so on.

My question is Should I see a doctor to prepare for possible future complications and if so what should I be looking out for?

So my new rule is - no swimming unless its your own heated pool that isn't open to germ-bloggs public. Looking for my sugar daddy now."
Anyone else with me?

New study suggests a prevalence of Sjogren's syndrome above 4&#37;. [British Medical Journal article](https://ard.bmj.com/content/56/9/521.short)
I posted this a while back:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/7z6rn1/excessive_yawningsighing_leading_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link

It turns out I'm not crazy! =D

"The yawning hasn't disapeared completely, but it's got much better since I have stronger antacids.  So on the off-chance that anybody else has this problem: the reflux irritates your esophagus which in turn presses on your wind pipe and can lead to yawning, weird sighing, and a general feeling of not breathing properly."
#/r/u4u

"In my experience with chronic illness I've noticed that the subject of dating and/or finding friends with such an illness pops up on a regular basis. Chronic illness of any sort is not only a naturally isolating condition but one which, for many reasons, makes mingling in the normal dating pool a tricky proposition. So I was a bit surprised that there was no dating app or platform for people in our shoes, and decided to make one."

"/r/u4u --or, alternately, **Unwell 4 Unwell--is meant to function exactly as /r/r4r functions**, with the obvious difference that it will be a niche especially catered to the unwell. That means you don't have to dance around the topic and instead directly get to knowing people who understand, to some extent, what you're going through without worrying whether your health situation will be a barrier."

"I have no idea whether this will ever get enough traffic to function smoothly, but I figure there are 157,000+ subscribers on r4r and even if only 1% of those users fall into this category--which, statistically speaking, is conservative--that would make for a healthy user base. Doesn't hurt to try."

"3. I could certainly use your help to promote /r/u4u elsewhere. As with any  person-to-person social media platform, these things require a certain critical mass of users to get off the ground, and more traffic means a greater likelihood that you will find your match!"

"Is it a thing to get sinus infections more frequently, particularly after a head cold, with SS?"

"For the past few years my general ss symptoms have gotten worse, and it seems that without fail I will get a cold, which in turn flares up my SS, and once the cold is on its way out I get hit with a sinus infection. A 3 day head cold turns into a month long ordeal. My guess is my sinuses are drying up and trapping the cold virus mucus up there. Neti pot hasn’t been much help except for temporary relief."

"It’s even worse lately because my wife is a teacher, and I have two kids at two different schools so every conceivable virus in town seems to make way to our house. By the time I recover from one cold the cycle starts over."

Has anyone experienced this or have any tips to get it under control (aside from an outbreak containment room my family has to pass through on the way into the house)?
"Hey all- I just needed to vent. I went on a 4 mile walk with my dog Saturday because it was such a beautiful day and another long walk Monday. Monday night into today I am absolutely exhausted. Crippling debilitating fatigue. I am so frustrated because I was just walking!! No running or intense exercise. During the walk I feel good besides some hip pain if I've gone a bit too far..Does anyone else experience this? I want to exercise daily and lose weight to get healthy but I just end up feeling so, so tired. How do I deal with this when there are other house chores and things I need to do and I'm just so depleted? Any advice encouragement welcomed."
And if so what are the mechanics behind it? I know a lot of autoimmune diseases are linked to hair loss but they talk about inflammation..... Like in lupus hair loss would make sense to me.

I have hair loss but I don't have inflammatory markers in my body that I'm aware of....  My hs-crp is a .3 and my liver enzymes are great..etc.
I'm a 21 year old male with sjogrens and I wanted to know if anyone has had eye issues or if their eyes are fine.
Does it help with mouth and eye dryness?
What about fatigue?
Do you have brain fog? Does it help with Brian fog?
Are there other measures I can take to help such as diet and exercising?
Has anyone been misdiagnosed?
I'm new to all of this and very overwhelmed.  Any help would be very appreciated.

"Hi all,"
"Dx with SLE and SS, but the SLE is much better controlled than the SS. I treated the fatigue, brain fog, and peripheral neuropathy with keto diet and supplements, but still have dry everything and am worried about long term health (esp dental). Has anyone had luck with Plaquenil for SS? Is there a better drug for us (with reasonably minimal side effects?) Thanks in advance."
"See my pics here - https://imgur.com/a/rTUhw  .  Was recently diagnosed with early SS.  Basic SS tests came back normal.  My dr ran a test that only one lab in the country has to detect early markers, and that came back positive.   My biggest problem is the redness in hands/feet/ears.  Gets worse at the day progresses.  The veins in my hands and fee get engorged.  Anyone have similar symptom?  This may be completely unrelated to SS."
"Male, 54.   went to a rheumatologist for different issue.  I have been having skin on my hands and feet (and knees , ears) get red and hot.  Really bad flushing also sometimes my head and neck.  Anywhere you touch my skin it  causes blanching.  GP send me rheumatologist .  He noticed my salivary gland looked enlarges.  Untrasound confirmed that.  I also started geting dry mouth over the last year.  Bloodwork for early detection came back positive.   Does anyone here have flushing or skin problems with SS?  FYI, I have had a zillion tests done already, and all were negative other than this early marker test."
"Hi there! I've made a survey about fibro/sjogrens that I would love for yall to fill out. I make youtube videos and plan to make a video talking about the responses. Below is a link to my video talking about the survey, and a link to the actual survey. Thanks so much!!"

Survey: https://goo.gl/forms/c3fdiaQtrn7cfzFt1
I was diagnosed with sjogrens a few years ago and for the most part have been able to manage my dry mouth using biotene products. However recently my dry mouth has been much more severe and I've developed a sore throat and dry cough that won't go away. Anyone have any suggestions to help my throat?
I was diagnosed with Sjogrens last year at age 26 via a few blood tests and an MRI to rule out salivary stones. The test came back positive for SSA. I don't have any other autoimmune issues that I'm aware of.

My husband and I plan to have children in the next 4 years. My rheumatologist told us that we needed to know that any pregnancy we have will be considered high-risk because of the chance of the fetus getting neonatal lupus.

I've done a bit of Googling but I haven't really found anyone else talking about neonatal lupus and Sjogrens. I'm curious if anyone out there has experienced this and would be willing to talk about what I might expect.
My doctor said I tested positive for Sjogrens. All she told me was to be careful of dry mouth and dry eyes (she's a rheumatologist btw). Is that all I need to worry about? I'm a healthy 23F and the only symptoms I have are dry mouth and a bit of fatigue. My skin is always dry but are there other things I should worry about? Was I misdiagnosed?

Edit: She ran a blood test because I have Raynaud's and the panel came back with a positive Sjogrens - nothing else.
Any young people here with Sjogren's? Especially males? Feel like I'm going through this alone.
I found this in a closed facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/SjogrensAlternatieTherapies/) and have copied it here to be available to more people. I've found that it has a significant number of mistakes so it will be an ongoing project to correct and cull the information. There are multiple alternative therapies suggested and I hope to leave only the most dependable ones.

"Keep having yeast infections. One to two per month. Have had prescription meds thrown at me by family doc and gynecologist to deal with it episodically. No flowery soap, restrictive clothes, etc. I see rheumatologist in a few weeks and will bring it up with him I think, seeing as that he'll answer my random questions when other docs won't (Quite efficiently, too)."

"I think I might be starting to get some dryness issues. I'm in my early 30's hormone levels are normal. Does using stuff like Replens help with preventing yeast infections? I'm doing some trial and error with lubricants during sex (Still getting a little pain there). The infections do seem to pop up a few days after, and husband doesn't have any yeast issues. Gynecologist brought up using Diflucan or something similar for a few months. I'd rather not do that if there's a less invasive solution."
Getting a diagnosis- Sjögren’s is typically diagnosed by a rheumatologist. The following criteria is what a rheumatologist will look at when diagnosing Sjögren’s. Note the criteria for primary and secondary are different.

**American-European Consensus Criteria for Sjögren’s Syndrome**
___

**I. Ocular Symptoms (at least one)**

"•	Symptoms of dry eyes for at least 3 months"

"•	A foreign body sensation in the eyes"

"•	Use of artificial tears 3 or more times per day"


**II. Oral Symptoms (at least one)**

"•	Symptoms of dry mouth for at least 3 months"

"•	Recurrent or persistently swollen salivary glands"

"•	Need for liquids to swallow dry foods"


**III. Ocular Signs (at least one)**

"•	Abnormal Schirmer’s test, (without anesthesia; ≤5 mm/5 minutes)"

"•	Positive vital dye staining of the eye surface"

**IV. Histopathology**

"•	Lip biopsy showing focal lymphocytic sialoadenitis (focus score ≥1 per 4 mm2)"

**V. Oral Signs (at least one)**

"•	Unstimulated whole salivary flow (≤1.5 mL in 15 minutes)"

"•	Abnormal parotid sialography"

___

For a ***primary*** Sjögren’s syndrome diagnosis:

"•	Any 4 of the 6 criteria, must include either item IV (Histopathology) or VI (Autoantibodies)"

"•	Any 3 of the 4 objective criteria (III, IV, V, VI)"

For a ***secondary*** Sjögren’s syndrome diagnosis:
"In patients with another well-defined major connective tissue disease, the presence of one symptom (I or II) plus 2 of the 3 objective criteria (III, IV and V) is indicative of secondary SS."

"Hi. I don't know if I should post to this sub, chronic pain, or some other because I still dont have a formal diagnosis. For the past three weeks or more, I have been having a high level of pain focused on one joint. I hadn't been in to see my rheumy in a year bc it has been almost 3 years since the start of my health issues and I had gotten tired of the endless doctor merrygoround with little other than treating the symptoms and no official answer. In the meantime, I suffer and people around me think I am making it up, faking, being dramatic or whatever."

This makes me so mad bc I used to be so active.

"3 years ago(ish): I had formerly trained in Tae Kwon Do and had made the switch to jiu jitsu. I also did yoga. And volunteered an as ESL teacher while homeschooling my son and working a part time job. Then I was exposed to TB through one of the refugees I was tutoring. I did not get TB, but I did begin feeling tired and achy all the time. Next thing I know, I can't buckle my seat belt without pain.  I blamed it yoga injury. Then all the other symptoms started. Dry eyes. Pain in more joints. I got a staph infection from my dry skin splitting open and exposing me to a round of it going around at work. But I didnt know it was staph at first."

"I went to a doctor who said the dry skin was due to winter (without looking at the site). He gave me a steroid cream to apply and gave me a sample of Lexapro bc apparently when women complain of pain and discomfort, they are just depressed. The steroids made the staph infection go wild."

"In the meantime, I went to a hand surgeon about what I was now sure was carpal tunnel bc my right hand was hurting pretty badly within 5-15 minutes of typing. By this point, I was having hand weakness and burning in my arm. No sign of anything on x ray. I was referred for an EMG and some nerve issues were found. By now, the staph infection was still undiagnosed."

"I kept using the cream and I started being unable to walk correctly.  I was sent onto neurologist after the arm EMG bc of my complaints of impaired walking and arm pain, burning and tingling who dismissed my complaints rather quickly and rudely after mri revealed no plaques. At this point, I was tested for various things. I had a positive ANA result and was sent to rheumy. No other issues showed up in bloodwork other than low vitamin D and I was told to take otc meds for joint pain and given vitamin d rx."

"At a certain point, I went to a different primary doc. He diagnosed the split skin issue as being colonized with staph. Not mrsa thankfully. I was given two different antibiotics. I had the worst weakness and walking issues clear up. It took eight months from my first complaint to this point."

Onto eye doc. Dry eyes confirmed by Schirmers and staining.  This was not enough for a formal Sjogrens diagnosis. Was then sent to have lip biopsy which I skipped due to doctor exhaustion at this point. Neurologist was an a-hole during one of my appointments and I don't cope well with people's attitudes.

"ETC ETC Fast forward, given gabapentin for ongoing neuropathic pain. Told to take aleve for joint pain which made various joints feel hot achy and 'cottony' --dont know how else to describe it. Like they were stuffed with cloth but in a restrictive uncomfortable way. Not a fluffy padded Charmin way. Also diagnosed with Reynauds, but only after providing doctor with photographic evidence of fingers turning blue in an air conditioned office at work. Was given nifedipine. Side effect was a migraine that felt like childbirth via my skull. I've had a kid, so I know what that feels like."

"Fast forward 2013: I get tired of people saying things like, maybe you have fibromyalgia, and they say it condescendingly, with a sneer, like its code for hypochondria. I quit going to docs, quit taking my gabbers, even though they did lessen the arm burning and pain. Suffer. Start drinking more. Gain 11 lbs. I am short and so this is a lot of extra weight for me. Quit yoga. Quit activities. Lay in bed for hours and hours at a time in a combination of fatigue and depression."


"2014: January, fatigue again. Skin splits in original site. The steroid cream first stupid doc prescribed me thinned my skin. It splits really easily all the time now.  Gets colonized again with staph. Also gets a new and improved mystery rash which spreads all the way to my nether regions bc dry skin is near my hindquarters. Antibiotics again. At least it didn't take eight months for them to do something about it this time."

"Then a new and improved finger pain comes around. My pinky knuckle. It feels broken. But I didn't do anything to break it. No sleeping anymore. I now have two different kinds of pain on one arm at the same time, non stop. I feel that I am going to go crazy. Go back to the one sympathetic doctor I have, my rheumy. She gives me a gentle lecture for being gone for a year, puts me back on the gabbers and takes xrays and new bloodwork. I was sure the knuckle was broken. Or fractured. Or inflamed. Something. Anything.  Nope. Xrays are normal. Bloodwork--effing normal. No markers of inflammation or others show out of range. She sends me home with a sample of Voltaren Gel, which i immediately begin using and seems to make no difference but comes with an awesomely worrisome side effect warning list."

"So now what? Today the hand started swelling and I was glad. I took photos of it bc this is what I now feel I have to do to get someone to believe me other than my husband.  I dared my hand out loud to swell until it burst open bc then someone would have to do something about it. Something other than NSAIDs. I don't know which doctor to even go to about this. Its like being stuck in a hellish loop of choose your own medical adventure. Do I go (back) to a hand surgeon to see if its a tendon issue? Do I go to a new, hopefully non a-hole neuro and see if it is the neuropathy worsening and bringing some new complication?"

"And in the meantime, I want to scream at anyone who dares to be skeptical about my condition when I used to train martial arts with grown men and I got a kick out of fighting and getting knocked around and knocking people back too.  I have had a child, bicycled to work for fun, P90x and all other sorts of extreme type workouts, taken various hits and soreness of all kind and not taken any sort of pain med for it other than a hot bath and gone back for more. So yes, when I say I can't use this hand or even put it through my sleeve without it hurting, it really does hurt."

Forgive my wall of text. This has been a long time coming and the first time I've gotten it all out.
TLDR: This stuff sucks. It hurts. We still don't know what all 'it' is and I am frustrated by it all.

Can anyone please tell me if when their hand swells and hurts if they went through anything like this where there was no sign of explanation on the xray but it still ended up showing up on paper through bloodwork later? Tired of not knowing what is going on. Sorry for such a long post. I am angry and in pain.


"Did you manage to resolve it?  And how?  I'll have months where I'll flare up really badly, my skin will hurt, and I'll lose a ton of eyelashes and hair, and then months where it's okay.  (This is apart from my extreme allergies and skin issues, which have been running my life for the past 1.5 years.  I can't do any of this anymore.)"
"Hi all. I'm 46 yrs old and have symptoms that overlap between Sjogren's and Wegener's granulomatosis. I've tested positive for Wegener's for about 18 months and have had one retinal vein occlusion (blood clot in the retina). I started developing Sjogren's-like symptoms 90 days ago. I also live with mast cell activation syndrome (aka MCAS), fibromyalgia, dysautonomia/POTS, and other chronic illnesses."

"Got a corneal burn (both eyes) in mid-July 2019 from accidentally looking in the direction of a ceiling light fixture while I was trying to check out some bugs on the ceiling. My eyes have never returned to normal, despite steroid eye drops. Still on steroid eye drops and started Restasis a week ago, all under care of an excellent ophthalmologist. He's the doc who told me my eye issues were autoimmune-related and asked me to discuss it with my rheumatologist."

"Saw rheumatologist a week ago and he thinks I have lupus and Sjogren's, and am teetering on the edge of Wegener's. I'm descended from the lineage of a consanguineous marriage (my maternal great-grandmother married her 1st cousin), and my mother's side of the family has a lot of genetic and autoimmune diseases as a result, unfortunately."

"I have to wear sunglasses at all times, indoors and outdoors, except in my apt., where I've changed all the bulbs to 15 watt bulbs. I still have to look away from my lighting fixtures, since the bulbs are all exposed and even at 15 watts, if I look at the bulb I'll get a corneal burn all over again. It doesn't matter how many Refresh drops I put in...severe light sensitivity remains. Doc told me it will take Restasis at least a month before it starts helping."

"I can't drive -- my sunglasses are not strong enough for me to drive west during the 2nd half of the day when the sun is setting...and I have very dark, anti-glare lenses. I wear a wide-brimmed hat to block light that my sunglasses don't, like light from above my head or sunlight coming at me from the side, which can get behind my sunglasses."

I asked my docs (rheum & oph) if over time the Restasis would restore my previous tolerance for indoor and outdoor light...they said they don't know.

"For those of you who have lived with Sjogren's for a while, how do you tolerate sunlight? How do you drive if you can't tolerate sunlight?"

"A week ago my mouth and throat started to get dry. Sometimes I can't taste my food. And sometimes I have a chronic, light dry cough."

Any advice regarding sunglasses and driving is very much welcome!
"I've never considered that I have dry mouth; I just can't figure out why no one drinks as much water as me.  I mean, how could they possibly be healthy on such minimal fluid intake?"

"41F, positive for SS-A and SS-B. After my recent physical exam, my rheumatologist tells me she thinks I have dry mouth.  I drink maybe 9 litres of liquids a day.  Understandably, I also have excessive urine output.  (Some weird electrolyte imbalances and too much creatinine in my blood as well.). Docs are trying to figure out if I might have diabetes insipidus, hence the excessive thirst."

"Has anyone had this experience where your fluid intake was though to be caused by Sjogrens' classic dry mouth, but in fact it was diabetes insipidus?"
"I just started taking Plaquenil about 5 days ago and started spotting today--TMI, but relevant--i have a non-hormonal IUD and have a very regular cycle, so the spotting is super unusual! Anyone else have that problem?"
I have several symptoms of Sjogrens. Even my dentist told me he thinks I have it. But my SS-A and SS-B tests are negative (tested in 2015 and 2017).

"Because this has been going on so long, and I'm again experiencing unexplained lung issues, I'm trying to write out a timeline to present to my doctor in hopes that she'll refer me to a rheumatologist."

"One persistent problem I have that I haven't seen mentioned in relation to Sjogrens is my feet peel, constantly. The bottoms, sides, and all around my toes. I'm talking sheets of skin, not flakes. If I wear shoes, my feet get burned. Hot, red, painful burn. Just like a sunburn. And then my feet peel, just like after a sunburn. My skin has been tested and no fungus is present. I mostly wear flip flops to avoid the burn but my feet still peel, just not nearly as bad. My feet have been peeling like this for about six years. One doctor told me I wash my feet too often.🤦‍♀️"

Has anyone heard of anything like that? I'm not sure if I should list it.

"Just as an FYI, my other symptoms are dry eyes, dry mouth, mouth tastes like salt ALL the time, intermittent bilateral parotid gland swelling, and Raynaud's."

"In the middle of trying to figure out my salty mouth, the ENT's physician's assistant found a lump on my neck. Thyroid cancer. They no longer cared about my salty mouth and cancelled my appointment with the ENT to discuss lip biopsy. The head and neck surgeon who removed my thyroid told me not to do the lip biopsy because I'd end up with a permanently numb lip. I think it was his office who cancelled my ENT appointment. That was 2017."

"Currently, I'm coughing, short of breath, occasionally tingly feet, hands, and even lips. Some weird chest pain with breathing. I had the same thing happen in 2014 and no one ever figured it out. It went away on its own after a month or so."

I have a congenital heart defect (discovered through all the testing in 2014) and my cardiologist just ruled out my heart as a cause of my current breathing issues.  I read something here about bronchiectasis and small fiber neuropathy. And now I'm wondering. I usually don't bother going back to the doctor's office because they can never seem to figure me out.

"I have one other weird symptom: my knee often hurts but it's not an injury type pain. It feels like bone pain. It doesn't hurt when I run or walk. It hurts when I'm sitting at my desk, driving my car, etc. If I press on the area of pain, it feels better."

"I'm sorry this was all over the place. It's been a long, strange six years."

Thanks for sharing your knowledge.
"Hello! I am so confused by all my random tests! I had a positive ana 1:320. Negative for everything else. Negative lip biopsy but I produced ZERO tears in my Schimer test. Other symptoms are extreme joint pain and swelling, fevers 100.4 -101 most evenings and some day time. Brain fog, memory loss, extreme fatigue, mouth dryness, tooth decay, hair loss, seizures, numbness and tingling in hands and face occasionally, mouth sores, raynaurds on my hands, random rashes all over my body. Unexplained abdominal pain, nausea. Body aches, elevated resting heart rate and an abnormal EKG. Frequent, urgent, painful urination. I haven’t seen my Rheum since the Schimer test, but he keeps telling me that since my blood work is normal- that I do not have an auto immune. However, I keep asking what ELSE causes all of these things? I had to force him to treat me- started on steroids, and he keeps wanting to lower them but when we do my pain goes through the roof- started me on Plaquenil when I had a melt down in his office. I keep thinking I need a second opinion but then he does things like- call me within minutes of getting notes from my PCP in regards to symptoms I am having to check on me. He always responds to my messages same day- often within an hour or less. I have learned that those things are not to be taken for granted but I am also SOOO frustrated!! Any thoughts, advice info greatly appreciated!!"
"I don’t science well, and this is probably a silly question. I don’t seem to have bad dryness in the front of my mouth. I mostly have an issue with the back, and having a dry throat. Since the lip biopsy is obviously on a salivary gland in the front, would it be possible for it to come up negative and still have SS? I’d really rather have an ultrasound of my parotid done, but am not sure who to see for that."

"Update: I got test results back from the early Sjogren’s panel today, and was positive for 3 of them, with a pretty high positive for the parotid antibodies. Doc said since my symptoms match so easily, he’s confident I have it and I don’t need to do a biopsy."
"Hello! I am in the midst of an autoimmune diagnosis. I suffer from joint pain and swelling and my PCP did some tests and I have a positive ANA but so far everything else has been negative. I have been complaining for a few months about difficulties swallowing, I have dry mouth in the extreme I always assumed was from meds, I also have a pair of very swollen and painful glands I always thought were lymph nodes because when they get really bad I usually feel tired and achy. That part has been going on for years. Recently my eyes have become very dry- and slightly blurry. I get bad sores in my mouth or tongue and I have recently been losing all of my old fillings in my teeth. I have a lot of lupus symptoms, also many sjorgens symptoms but my Rheum refuses to make a “diagnosis” until something jumps out at him. The positive Ana and multiples of symptoms of both are not enough apparently- he really wants a positive test- or a malar rash. He sent a referral to an ENT for a lip biopsy to test for Sjogrens. My appointment is in a few weeks and I have no idea what to expect. Any advice for me on my search for a diagnosis? How many of you actually have had, lupus,sjorgens or both with similar negative tests and positive symptoms? My Rheum wanted to wait to treat but after basically a breakdown in his office he has put me in 15mg of prednisone a day and 400 mg of plaqunil a day. I would love any advice, personal stories etc etc from anyone that has gone through this in their lives. I am so tired of feeling like crap all the time and not knowing what is wrong with me. Has anyone had these symptoms that ended up NOT being autoimmune?"

Thanks in advance!
"Has anyone used TCM (acupuncture, herbs, etc.) to treat your SS? What has been your experience?"
Hi All!
"I’m scheduled to have a lip biopsy next Wednesday to confirm my rheumatologist suspicions of Sjogrens (positive ANA with anti-centromere pattern, negative SSA and SSB). I’m supposed to be going out of town next Friday, which would be two days later. I’ve seen mixed reviews on the recovery from the biopsy, but based on your experience, do you think I will be okay to go by then? It’s just a three hour drive away from where I live for three days, but I don’t want to be miserable the whole time and I’d like to be able to eat haha. Please feel free to share any other advice and tips about the procedure as well :)"
Thanks for your help!
"I've had numbness for years in my feet and lips. I've had swollen parotids on both sides, no pain, for about 6 months, along with fatigue. Dry eyes and mouth started about a couple months ago, and being tested for Sjogrens. Rheumy put me on generic plaquenil as I wait for some blood work results. No other symptoms. Sometimes my parotids are bigger than usual. I've heard people mention flares. Would this be considered a flare? Is there any way to reduce the swelling + any remedies for fatigue? I sometimes sleep 14 hours on weekends and could sleep more; I have to force myself to get up so I don't miss out on life. Getting up for work during the week is pure torture."
I began to read this article on a recent study indicating that Sjögren's Syndrome is associated with lower estrogen exposure and quickly realized that it was written by my doctor.

[Lower estrogen exposure linked to increased risk for Sjögren's syndrome in women](https://www.healio.com/rheumatology/sjogrens-syndrome/news/online/%7B148169dc-0273-4098-ae58-d0d553d46b7a%7D/lower-estrogen-exposure-linked-to-increased-risk-for-sjgrens-syndrome-in-women)
"I’ve been diagnosed since April w/ SS. Rheum first thought RA & Lupus as I have a lot of those symptoms as well, but no inflammatory markers in my blood and with the more in depth ANA test, they ruled out those conditions and settled on SS."

"I've been on prednisone since March, started at 50mg/day now down to 5mg/day, w/ 200mg Plaquenil 2x/day."

"My rheum says I shouldn’t be experiencing any more hand pain (which is the main reason I went to the doctors in first place in March and they found something wrong; high Rheumatoid factor). And when I do have pain, I should take 4 200mg Aleve 3x/day for however long I need. Never mind it tears my stomach up after four days."

"The mouth dryness is much better (who knew most ppl don't feel thirsty in their mouth?), but I’m still experiencing severe hand weakness -can’t hold things well, have a hard time driving as clutching the steering wheel causes pain in my finger knuckles, bending my hands feels like I have rubber bands I’m fighting & hand aches. Severe fatigue- I have 4 hours of useable time I would say. Six, if I'm lucky and excited about whatever I'm doing."

The pain has steadily progressed back to having to change my lifestyle again as the pred dose has dropped - I felt best pain wise at 10mg of pred and the 400mg of plaquenil/day.

"So the reality check is; am I freaking crazy? Its been recommended by my Rheum, that once I get my depression/anxiety under control by meditation and therapy, that I’ll feel better as a whole. I’m sure that’s the case, but I’m made to feel like it’s all in my head and I shouldn’t feel like I do. I cant be the only one that lives like this. "
29 yo guy with chronic dry mouth for 1.5 years. Mouth is dry most of the time except when i eat. Currently on no meds but was on SSRI’s most of last year. It definitely gets worse with anxiety and stress but my saliva is thick and its hard to talk even when im relaxed.

My bloods came back ok except for neutrophils (white blood cells) which were low.  Im generally always fatigued.

Could it be sjorgens? I’ve finally found a doc who took bloods today to check.
"I woke up a week ago with swollen parotid gland on one side, no explanation that I or my doc could find...then a couple of days later began having terribly dry, red eyes. Everything I google comes up Sjogren's...can it come on suddenly like this?"
"Is being extremely thirsty all of time a known symptom of Sjogrens? I’m still not diagnosed with Sjogrens after several rounds of blood tests, but not able to get any other diagnosis why i have super dry mouth and very dry eyes."
"A lot of the Sjogrens symptoms seem spot on for me, but have not found mention of my constant thirst."
"I know having a dry mouth makes you perceive that you need water, but my thirst is so intense that I have to have water in hand at all times."

"Doc tested me for Diabetes Insipidus, which causes thirst due to Kidney or thalamus issue, but that was negative."

Hi all. Seeing a specialist in a week about my dry mouth and was wondering if anyone has had success with either medication? I’m hoping I can get put on something because I am getting sick of sucking on lozenges all day!
"Does anyone else here pull a muscle super easily without doing any major movement? It mostly happens in my shoulder/upper arm for me, and I've become incredibly frustrated with how often it happens."
I’m curious how long it took you to be diagnosed with Sjögren’s? And what symptoms beside dry mouth/dry eyes did/do you experience?

"I am suspecting I have Sjögren’s and will be discussing with my doctors. For almost 3 years I’ve been having odd medical issues that have all been labeled idiopathic and no one knows what is causing them. I’m a 28 F, 25 when things started. My diagnosis are as follows:"
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
- Dysautonomia (Orthostatic hypotension). I’m being tested for POTS in a week.

"I also have been developing dry eyes, dry mouth, dry lips, pretty much every orifice is dry. I drink 7 liters of water/electrolyte drinks a day and I STILL feel dehydrated..."

6/20 UPDATE
"I finally got the results from a recent lip biopsy and they were positive. I had  >=1 Focal Lymphocytic Sialadenitis even though I was negative in all bloodwork, except for a borderline positive ANA IFA 1:80. I am going to try and get my doctor to finally diagnose me and if he won’t listen then I’m seeking out someone else."

I will keep this updated in the hopes of helping other people who have similar symptoms.
"I’ve been dealing with Sjogren’s since 2013, kind of brushed things off for a while, and only recently saw a Rheumatologist to help manage my symptoms. I know literature and studies say there’s no relationship to Sjogren’s and infertility, but I was wondering if anyone else is dealing with infertility and having Sjogren’s. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for at least two years now and have even seen the reproductive endocrinologist. Attempts for IUIs were unsuccessful and due to medication side effects we’ve opted to not pursue IVF."

Feel free to PM me if you don’t want to post your own experience publicly.
"Since at least adolescents one of my eyes has been in pain and swollen, but the other doesn’t bother me. Is this something seen in sjorens? It’s my most debilitating symptom, I want to keep the effected eye closed it’s so bothersome. The antidepressants I take make it worse but I can’t function without something."
"Hi all, just after some general advice on how I can approach my doctor with this. I'm pretty sure I have been suffering for years and not being diagnosed. I also suspect renal tubular acidosis as a result. It's the only thing that makes sense to me after so many trips to the hospital and GP appointments, along with my list of symptoms."

"I'm almost certain but I'm struggling on how to approach this, doctors don't normally like it when you tell them things like this."

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you
"I have been able to deal with the hassle of the lack of saliva in my mouth fairly well by taking very strong mints, however recently I’ve been plagued with dryness in my nose due to the lack of mucus etc. my doc recommended sprays but came with little help, now my nose is sore/scabbed up on the inside. Anyone else have this issue? Plz HELP!"
"So I've finally had my appointment with a rheumatologist after about a years wait, and long story short I turned up just to be told that seronegative Sjogrens is not real? So I was dismissed based on my blood tests."


"Not trying to go into my problems, I've made posts on it in the past if you really wanna check, I just wanna know what you think as I was under the impression about 30% of people with Sjogrens don't have antibodies, and an even higher percentage in young males like myself?"

Edit: here was my original post

https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/8z0hgk/negative_blood_tests/
"Diagnosed 2 years ago with primary Sjögren’s (aged 27). As well as the usual symptoms (dryness, swollen glands, aching) I’ve noticed that recently I’ve had loads more headaches, an increase in anxiety and a decrease in motivation and mood. Anyone else have this?"
A lot of people are really scared to begin exercising again when they've been living with pain from an autoimmune for so long. Andrea has one for you and talks to Sjogren's Strong about it in this podcast episode.

"Hello! I have known Ive had Sjogren's for years, but was just diagnosed last year along with RA. I am currently on Plaquenil and was prescribed Restasis... I do not take the Restasis, the side effects were out weighing the gains, and I use a lot of OTC drops instead. I'm something of a conneseur and currently love Retaine HPMC drops."

Anyway! I struggle with salivary stones and infections. Simultaneously I have poor tooth enamel. My teeth crumble and get cavities at just the thought! It feels like it is constant and I cant catch up because it is so hard to get a dentist to do work on more than one tooth in a visit. I cant afford 10 co-pays and all that time off of work!

I was given a prescription to deter cavities but it is not meant to be rinsed after use at bedtime... Except I have Sjogren's and am dying for water almost immediately after having toothpaste in my mouth! I have tried CloSys mouthwash to boost my tooth strength but it makes everything I eat taste sour.

Do any of you have similar problems? Any advice?!
What do you guys use for muscle soreness?

"Hey guys! I went to a new rheumatologist today and finally found one with some awesome knowledge. Some background info, I'm 35 and have been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis for over a decade. Today he added sjogrens to the list. So I just wanted to see what I'm in for. I completely understand the disease itself since I have almost every symptom they list. I'm just looking for some helpful tips that only you pros out there know from trail and error. (Example, I see now that i can no longer take hot baths or I get terrible tingling and burning in my hands and feet.) Also what am I to expect in the long term from this? Any info would be extremely helpful. thanks in advance!"
"I used to wake up almost every day with dry, puffy, red eyes. Since my diagnosis of Sjögrens, I have been using a night eye drops and the change is amazing. I've also read a couple of tips in this sub and they've really improved my symptoms. So thank you!"
"I didn't have positive sjogrens antibodies, but have positive ANA plus Hashis and I have all the symptoms."

"Extreme dryness eyes nose mouth throat, rheumy pains in joins, fatigue and now the joys of neuropathy."

Dr wants the lip biopsy and I am scared.

"Im not as worried about procedure itself,  but I feel like they take out too many salivary glands and dont we need all we can get ? ....especially if they are failing us ?!"

&#x200B;

"Also hear bad stories online of nerve damage permenant numbness,"

but I also worry what affect having less salivary glands will have on my body or oral health.

Any insights or advice?

Are there any other emerging tests for Sjogren's I could take instead of the biopsy? I read about one but seems nobody is using it.

"I am a scholar that has been managing a chronic illness, lupus, since my diagnosis at 19 years old. Through the years I have seen the affect my chronic illness has had not only on my body, but on my identity and overall well-being—both positive and negative. Research on the social aspects of chronic illness is limited and we need to understand more about people’s experience to improve the physical and mental health care individuals with chronic illness receive. In my research, I want to gain insight into personal experiences after diagnosis, with the hopes of working with practitioners to develop programs, guidance, and suggestions on how to improve well-being in various aspects of individuals’ lives after diagnosis. Additionally, understanding these experiences can help individuals’ dealing with chronic illnesses communicate about their illness to family and friends who do not have a chronic illness. With these goals in mind, I have created a questionnaire asking about your chronic illness diagnoses, identity, and well-being. The survey takes 20 minutes on average.

"These days, every time I blow my nose my tissue looks like a used tampon, and it's getting old. Besides the old vaseline-the-nostrils trick, what works for you?"
"I was diagnosed almost 8 months ago and nothing. No medicines, no advice on what to do, no recommendations to specialist. Nothing. My primary care doctor has told me I have it but nothing else. Nothing on how to live with this shit. I heard your supposed to go to a rhymetologist but I can't even get a recommendation"
"Hi everyone, 31 year old female here. So I found out recently I have a clotting disorder, APS (aka Lupus Anticoagulant) due to pregnancy complications a couple years ago. Anyway, I just had even further blood work done to check for actual Lupus itself etc, and I tested negative for that, however I did test positive for Sjögren's. I’m a little shocked because I have zero symptoms of this. Is it normal to not have any? I mean, at least I don’t think I have any. I know that sounds stupid. I’m just not sure what to expect from it. Should I expect to have symptoms turn up eventually? Is it a ""silent disease"" at all? Please excuse my ignorance. I’m being referred to a rheumatologist for further testing being that it’s quite odd that I have two big markers for Lupus yet tested negative for the disease itself. I hope this was the proper sub to post in, please delete if not. I’m just at a loss right now and anxiety is through the roof. Thank you!"

"Since last week I've experienced significant dryness in my mouth and throat, which exacerbates this weird injury I have, my doctor thinks it's a pulled muscle in my chest. I recently was diagnoses with sjogren's, they did an xray and there are no signs of copd. I have never had asthma or allergies, but for the past few days I have chest tightness and shortness of breath, at times seeming like I am struggling to get air. It can get really bad, I feel like I have to go to the ER but it does pass after time. my oxygen levels are normal. My pain and soreness in my arms and chest feel like a flare up, but could also be an injury. Idk what I did but who knows. I searched and haven't seen anyone else discuss this as part of sjogren's. Has anyone else gone through this?"
I am 26 f and recently diagnosed with Sjögren’s late last year. I do not know much about it still but would love to talk to others about it. I just would like to have someone to finally relate to in this aspect of my life.
So I’m wondering if this is because of the dry mouth or not but when I’m eating I can’t eat much before when I go to chew my food I start gagging before I can swallow it (maybe because I have to chew for so long? Really don’t know) and also I’ve had a really hard time swallowing things especially anything dry or pills. Sometimes I even throw up because I can’t get stuff down and then even choke on the throw up (sorry for the gross details) Just wanted to see if anyone else had similar issues to know if dry mouth could cause all of this?
"My boyfriend complains that there is always something wrong with me and I’ve felt this way for years. I miss work and am usually miserable but I always thought the most random things were wrong with me. My eyes are so dry and hurt so bad I have to immediately use eye drops when I wake up and ice my eyes before I can get out of bed. My mouth is so dry that I never stop drinking the entire time I’m awake and I got prescribed toothpaste for it and now it’s gotten to the point where I gag when I try to eat bread and other things. My teeth are getting in worse shape everyday no matter how good care I take of them and practically all have cavities or more serious issues. Basically I’m dry all over. But a lot of my issues are gastrointestinal. And I randomly get dizzy and my eyes can’t focus and hurt. My whole body hurts and I have numbness in my hands and feet. I have been diagnosed with laryngopharangeal reflux (like GERD but mostly affects your throat). I’m exhausted all the time no matter how much sleep I get that it’s very hard to function. Basically it’s always something and I thought unrelated until I came across Sjögrens. Unfortunately I don’t have insurance so I’m not sure what to even do about it, but my question is what symptoms besides the dryness are the most prevalent for y’all?"
"I have spent some time researching my symptoms: dry mouth episodes, waking up with noticeable but not bothering dry mouth and more teeth issues."

"I went to rheumy, did all kinds of blood tests from ANA to Sjogren's markers, then did salivary glands ultrasound. All negative."

"Can I still have it despite all this? Not really willing to do lip biopsy. My father also has dry eyes and mouth, and more teeth issues than usual (in fact, his were very good to late 40s, then gone downhill in 2 years)."
"What would you recommend to help alleviate the pain from joint/muscle pains? I already use Advil NSAID Gel caps, what are some other recommendations that's work for all of you, input on this is really appreciative."

"Does anyone have dizziness or lightheadedness with secondary Sjogren's? Mine started maybe 2 months ago and I had recently started a new medication so my doc chalked it up to a side effect. However, the dizziness went away for a little bit and now it's back. I cannot find any rhyme or reason to it, other than my Sjogren's begin flaring about when the dizziness began so I kind of assume its somewhat related. Has anyone had the same experience? If so what did you do? It's beginning to really affect my life. I can hardly move or think while it is happening."

"Also, recently went to see my rheum and mentioned some issues I had, I wanted to see if they were Sjogren's related. Turns out they were caused by damage done to nerves by Sjogren's. Does anyone know if this kind of nerve damage is permanent or if symptoms will go away once Sjogren's is under control?"
"I'm a 41 year old man.  I've had an ER visit once a year for the past three years due to extreme chest pain right at my solar plexus and radiating to my back. I thought it was pancreatic pain based on my internet research. After reading comments here, I believe they were ""flare ups"".  After each ER visit, they would run all the blood tests, ultrasound, etc. Never finding anything, until this year."

"Back up a year... during my annual physical, one of the Sjogren's markers was positive.  My doctor said don't worry we'll check it again in 6 months to a year.  Fast forward a few months to this past January 2017.  I went to the ER again for my pains.  This time, they did find that both my liver and spleen were enlarged. I was referred to a GI specialist."

"All of my blood work came back okay, but they did another ultrasound showing that my liver and spleen were still enlarged, this was in April 2017.  Since my blood was okay, they said improve your diet, don't drink any alcohol at all and we'll test again in October."

"This past week, I had another annual exam with my General Practitioner.  I found out two days ago that two markers are showing up now for Sjogrens, and I also have markers SGOT, SGPT that are high indicating a problem with my liver.  By the way, I have completely stopped drinking and improved my diet, I expected my liver to go back to normal :(  I have another ultrasound to check my GI stuff next week."

"Right now, I'm waiting for a call from my referral to my rheumatologist.  I had a cold a couple of weeks ago, my throat is still sore!  Every morning I wake up it almost hurts to close my mouth it's so dry."

"Also, to add to the Sjogren's dryness, I have chronic migraines.  I finally got those under control with Amitryptaline that was prescribed by my neurologist.   Sadly, one of its side effects is dry mouth... I imagine I will have to stop taking it."

"Not sure the purpose of my post.  I appreciate everyone that took the time to read it.  I just really hope that medications improve my quality of life and I hope I can reverse some of the damage that this disease has done to my spleen and liver.  I have a 4 year old daughter and another daughter due in November.  I want to be there for them through school, dance at their weddings and all of that good stuff."

"Newly diagnosed through positive antibody and lip biopsy. 30,M. Also a recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic. It's been a bad two years... I basically diagnosed myself due to chronic eye issues, but in hindsight, a lot of the symptoms fit."

"My biggest issue is the the cornea of my right eye is no longer flat. It's done this before, about 5 years ago, and without really thinking about it, it seemed to heal on its own or I stopped noticing it. It has come back with a vengeance to the point that I'm not able to get new glasses because the blurring is so bad.  I assume at this point that I'll never wear contacts again."

"Any tips and tricks to help? I'm currently using Refresh brand gel drops and the nighttime gel, and I'm sure the preservatives aren't helping.  I'm so far avoiding the Plaquinil, because all of the side effects sound like they will exacerbate all of my diabetic symptoms."

"As for other symptoms, I haven't noticed excessive fatigue yet, though I haven't been looking for it.  Teeth are rotting out of my head.  I haven't had dry mouth since I've been on insulin."

Edit: why am I receiving down votes? I apologize if anything I said offended.

"Seriously suffering right now.  Fatigue, pain in my joints and a MS hug that has been going on non-stop for two days.  Feels like my ribs are trying to squeeze me to death.  Anyone else get that?"

"The doc even has me on oxycodone for pain on top of the plaquenil, lyrica, neurontin, and mobic.  It is barely putting a dent in the pain.  Urgh."
Some things about my journey so far:

"*Widespread pain and fatigue was what prompted me to go to the doctor. My GP/PCP poked and prodded me a bit, and sent me for some bloods. After my ESR came back high twice, he referred me to see a rheumatologist."

"*I was waiting a long time for that appointment because the healthcare system in Ireland is in shambles. When I got to see the rheumatologist, they said I am ""prone"" to fibromyalgia, dismissed my persistently high ESR and CRP as ""normal"" and sent me packing."

"*after complaining to the hospital about how woeful that appointment was, I received a new appointment for a second opinion. The second rheumy was lovely. Very helpful and keen to get to the bottom of the issue."
*He said he thinks that I have Sjogren's syndrome. I am inclined to agree - lots of my symptoms that were never explained by fibromyalgia are explained by the diagnosis of SS.

"*Nothing's definite yet. more tests need to be done. But its so odd having a potential diagnosis when you've been floating through uncertainty for years. It's weird looking back on things that have happened (my tongue and glands randomly swelling, for example, and having a fever with no other symptoms) and thinking ""well shit, that could be caused by Sjogren's."""

"Well, thank you for reading... that was a ramble!"

"My rheumatologist said today at my appointment that he's pretty much 100% sure I have Primary SS despite my negative blood work. I've had miscellaneous joint pain, dry mouth, and dry eye for over 10 years so this comes as a huge relief. That said, I'm still having a ton of joint pain and my dry eyes are becoming a huge problem despite my cocktail of drugs (plaquenil, exovac, and restasis). My rheumatologist said that he's going to try to get me into a clinical trial for a new drug they're developing for primary SS patients that he thinks is quite promising AND that the study will pay for extensive blood work not typically covered by insurance, a lip biopsy (to hopefully definitively make the diagnosis) and the drug, and I will be compensated for my time! I'm pretty much over the moon and I hope I qualify for the trial."

Here's the question- What's your daily regimen in terms of managing the symptoms of your SS? Here's mine right now:

"*Take exovac 3x day, plaquenil 2x, restasis 2x"
*Use artificial tears throughout the day (I'm trying to shoot for every 2 hours)
*Try to drink a ton of water
*At night I put a hot towel over my eyes to help the dryness
*At bedtime use Systane gel drops
*Use coconut oil as needed when I get vaginal dryness
*Take NSAIDs when joint pain becomes to much to bear
*Wear sunscreen religiously and avoid sun exposure
*Take naps and rest frequently when I feel a flare coming on

My dry mouth and dry eye are still out of control though. Any thoughts? Does Biotene really help? What's your regimen?



"Hi all,"
Sorry if this is a TMI post but I'm hoping someone can help!

"Right now I have a dx of UCTD due to a host of nonspecific complaints (IBS, wrist pain, neck/back pain, morning stiffness, dry mouth) completely normal blood work with the exception of a very low complement 4. I was started on plaquenil 2 weeks ago and feel some relief from it. I'm having some side effects though- itchy skin (no rashes yet), extreme sensitivity to sun, and now I have this horrible burning sensation on my outer labia. I'm only 26 and I have had some issues with getting wet during intercourse previously, but this is next level. It feels like a chemical burn. It hurts so bad I can't even wear a panty liner or pad with it because it irritates it further. I have been tested previously and have no STIs and haven't had sex in over a month anyways. My Rheumy said that it's probably a yeast infection and unrelated to the plaquenil, so I have an appointment on Monday with my obgyn. But I've never had a yeast infection like this. No discharge, primary complaint is horrible burning/dryness/itching made worse by touching it. My mind is going two places though: could this be merely a symptom of sjrogens although not the typical presentation? Or a side effect of a generic version of plaquenil?  Anyone else have experiences like this with sjrogens?"

Update: All tests for yeast/bvi/stis came back negative. This is the 2nd time this has happened. I'm definitely concerned about Sjogrens and will bring it up with my rheumy next time I see him in August. :(
"Hello, thank you for indulging me. Just received confirmation of Sjogren's diagnosis (salivary gland biopsy confirms after a year of antibody and other tests led to this) and preparing for next Rheumatologist visit to discuss treatment. Nurse mentioned Plaquenil and prednisone, though just casually while booking apt in 2 weeks. Looking for any advice or experience on what you would ask your Dr if you were just starting this process again. If it helps some info about me: 47M, Hashimotos Thyroiditis for 2 years as well, low white cell count led to bone marrow biopsy which (though 'a little weird') did not support a cancer diagnosis, had mono about 5 years ago but as misdiagnosed so didn't really do anything about it, generally healthy and no significant symptoms yet (some dryness of eyes & mouth but not really aware of them until now that I am thinking about it, feel more tired than I used to but I'm not 35 any more...can still play men's league soccer and hockey so not like I'm debilitated, sometimes feel not as mentally quick as I used to but just a very vague sense not really failing at anything, ... kind of the vague cluster of inconclusive symptoms I read about elsewhere, which make me worry that I am either (i) underestimating the problems I may be experiencing, or (ii) attuned to what the symptoms can be and starting to find them as a result). So, all general advice or experiences welcome, with my specific focus being what to probe and ask about at the apt where we decide on treatments. Thank you for the attention!"

I'm 22 and I've been diagnosed since I was 11. Aren't I supposed to be adjusted by now? You'd think so right? Wrong! Most days I'm just so over life with this disease.  People think it's just dry mouth or eyes but it's much more than that. My official diagnosis is sjogrens with devics. I'm always exhausted or in pain. The medications are supposed to help but they cause other issues.  I wound up with other AI issues also. I also feel like people don't understand how shitty I really feel some days because I don't complain about it.

"I'm a 33 year-old male and have been in the Air Force for the past 15 years. I was just diagnosed with Sjogrens yesterday, and after a lot of reading and understanding the problems it causes, so much is starting to make sense."

"About six months ago, I was experiencing light sensitivity, almost like my eyes were dilated. I went to the optometrist, he looked at my eyes and immediately sent me to the ophthalmologist, where he found several hemorrhages in my right eye."

"After undergoing a ton of blood tests, it turned out that I was positive for an autoimmune disease and was sent to a rheumatologist, where more tests were conducted. It was yesterday when he confirmed that I indeed have SS and was vitamin D deficient."

"My symptoms today are primarily dry eyes and mouth, and indigestion."

"I have intermittent joint pain in my knee, shoulders and elbow, but I don't know how much of that is due to normal body pains and what, if any, can be attributed to SS. None of it's so bad that it keeps me from exercising and taking my annual fitness test, however, and I'm in pretty good physical shape."

"My biggest concern at this point is whether I'll be allowed to remain on active duty. My doctor prescribed me Plaquenil and Salagen, but in some of the research I read that others weren't able to deploy because of the medication. In some cases, the people were medically separated/retired due to SS."

Does anyone here have any information on how this could effect my military career?
"I was diagnosed around a month ago and my rheumatologist put me on Plaquenil, 400 mg/day. Things were going okay at first and I wasn't having any side effects, but about a week after I started taking it I began falling apart with awful stabbing shoulder pains, stabbing kidney pains, tachycardia, intense fatigue and frequent urination (more times a day than I can count and all through the night). Weirdly, I have had only minor GI problems and no nausea or dizziness (which I understand to be the most common side effects of Plaq). I decided to soldier through it and see if it went away. it didn't."

"I went to urgent care a few days ago and they did a urinalysis; it was clean. They told me I should just try to get into my rheumatologist earlier than the middle of December, when I'm scheduled to have my next appointment. I called up my rheumy's office yesterday and left a message for him. He called me back saying to just quit taking the Plaquenil (which btw I did several days ago, but maybe it takes time for it to leave your system) and just wait until my next appointment. He said he wouldn't prescribe me anything else at this point because all the other drugs are much less well-tolerated. He also said I should just go to my primary care doctor, who I know will tell me to go to my rheumatologist and send me away after 5 minutes."

"I'm just frustrated and depressed... I really had high hopes for Plaquenil and it seemed to me that so many people have had great results with it with almost no side effects. Of course, I can't be sure that it's the Plaquenil causing all of this, but I honestly really hope that it is, because if not it means I've developed some new chronic complications. So what next? Am I screwed if my body can't even handle the mildest drug used to treat this illness? Has anyone else dealt with this shit?"


"Testing- Being properly diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome can be difficult. The average time between the onset of SS and a diagnosis is 4.7 years. Part of this delay is that there isn’t a single test that can confirm a diagnosis of SS and that it can appear differently in different patients. Instead doctors depend on several tests and a physical examination. Blood tests includes blood tests for ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody), RF (Rheumatoid Factor), SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La), IGs (Immunoglobulins) and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate). Ophthalmologic tests for SS include Schirmer Test to measures tear production and Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green Eyedrops to examine the surface of the eye for dry spots. Dental test for SS include salivary flow which measures the amount of saliva produced, the salivary scintigraphy which is a nuclear medicine test that measures salivary gland function and a salivary gland biopsy (usually in the lower lip) which confirms inflammatory cell (lymphocytic) infiltration of the minor salivary glands."

"Officially received diagnosis this past Tuesday after a month of having pretty clear test results (only SSA and SSB). I have always had dry eyes and mouth, as well as swollen salivary glands and other issues, but I thought it was normal because I had no frame of reference. This has been the norm for me since I was about 12. I had only gone in the past 6 months because of joint issues I thought were unusual for my age/fitness level."

"Honestly, it was something I was more excited/happy about since I felt: hey! There's medication (started Plaquenil) and now I have a rheumatologist to help take care of me, and possible prednisone for really bad days. The day that I had gone in I was feeling great and NOTHING hurt, so rheumatologist said that my joints seemed good."

"But today it's completely different and I'm really, really upset for the first time."

"I have fenced for fun and semi-competitively for about 2 years now. It's something that I'm very passionate about and love. For those who know nothing about fencing, there are three different types: epee, foil, and sabre. Each has slightly different rules, target areas, and ways to score on the opponent. I fence epee, and today I was going with a friend to an all sabre practice."

"I went there, I felt immediately out of my league, didn't like the coach although I loved the fencers, and starting struggling after my 3rd bout. Everything  I was using just started to hurt: my wrist, fingers, ankles, elbows. I still kept going because I felt like I'd get judged if I had stopped and it was a great opportunity that I would have missed, but I should have."

"I was miserable. I didn't know how to deal with it. I spent most of the time on the verge of tears and trying not to let other people see it. I wish that I had had the prednisone, but I hadn't gotten or filled the prescription since they only order it as needed. I'm calling tomorrow and leaving a message to see if I can have a few on hand because I was 3 hours away and it all just hurt."

"I don't know how to handle this. At face value, Sjogren's doesn't seem so bad: dry mouth, dry eyes, whatever. But over the past couple of months the amount of joint pain has increased making it harder and harder to do what I love. Some people noticed because at one point, my friend got me an immobilizing wrist brace, which was great because I couldn't move it, but I can't find a way that I feel comfortable describing what's going on when they ask if I hurt myself."

"I just feel like all I did was come off as a poor sport, I'm in pain, and I'm not really happy right now."

"Sorry if this is confusing, it all just happened and I don't feel like editing."
"I'm 22/f, got diagnosed a year ago after several years of testing, as usual! My problem is mostly my salivary glands, if I'm not drinking enough water to keep them flushed they will swell up and cause tremendous pain when I try to eat. This doesn't seem a super common symptom from what I've read, does anyone else have salivary pain? Also how bad is anyone else's fatigue and does anyone have depression as well? I don't know how related it is, I seem to have bad mental genetics as well. Anywho it's cool to have somewhere to talk about it even if there isn't a ton of us on here!"
"This time last year, I started with a strange rash spreading around my nailbeds.  This eventually lead to blood work that came back ANA+ , high rheumatic factor.  I saw rheumatologist who sent me to a dermatologist for a biopsy and it came back pernio (or chronic chillblains) related to some unknown auto immune disorder.  Steroid cream cleared up the rash and I've been fine.  However, as it gets cold again, the rash is returning.  I do also have a history of Raynaud's that seems to be worsening, too and is occuring more frequently now because weather is turning colder."

"Last week I had my routine primary doctor visit and my liver function tests came back elevated.  Dr. sent me to a GI who wanted to rule out auto immune liver hepatitis.  He also did a lot of blood work.  Everything normal except ANA+ (again) with very high ANA titre. And, my sjogren's antibody Ssa? came back positive.  Ssb was negative."

"I've tried to condense this as much as possible.  Bottom line, I know I have some auto immune stuff going on.  But, do I have sjogren's?  I really don't have the symptoms ... I don't think?  I am unusually thirsty and must drink something non stop (I attributed this to following the KETO diet) and my eyes are a little scatchy in the AM.  A few times, I've asked my husband if I was snoring because I woke up with my mouth feeling dry all the way down my throat.  That's it.  Overall I feel great."

"I guess my questions are, Did anyone get diagnosed with minimal symptoms?  Has anyone heard of false positives on the Sjogren Ssa test?"

Thanks for reading
"I'm talking to my doctor later today, but would love some input from actual sufferers of Sjogren."
hey guys! wondering if anyone is from the MA/RI area and has a good rheumatologist they could recommend? I’m really not happy with mine!

Hi everyone. I’m new to this group bc I just had an ANA test which was positive along with positive SSA. Nothing else so far but seeing a rheumatologist Monday.

"In addition to autoimmune stuff I’m also dealing with heart issues. After giving birth in nov. 2017 I was officially DX with peripartum cardiomyopathy (ppcm) in feb. 2018 a type of pregnancy induced heart failure.  I’m still on meds (metoprolol and lisinopril) but a recent echo showed my heart has improved. Still, Anytime I get a cold/virus I end up with chest pressure and shortness of breath. It typically goes away once the virus passes. But this time I’ve been sick for almost a month."

"After an ER visit, pcp, and cardio visits my echo and blood work were mostly normal. I’ve had a lung function test and they’ve prescribed inhalers for shortness of breath which comes and goes. I was still feeling bad after 2 weeks so I asked for and ANA test which came back positive and high SSA suggesting sjogrens and a host of other things like lupus (which my mom has).  So far theyve said nothing official other than “autoimmune condition” and costochondritis. So I decided to cut back on gluten and dairy to be on the safe side."

"In the past 3+ weeks I’ve had muscle aches, weird headaches that seem to move around my head and settle in my cheeks, back pain and tingling, muscle twitching, shortness of breath, chest pressure, random lightning chest pain that disappears, brain fog, and seemingly out of nowhere I woke up feeling like my stomach/esophagus was burning and vomited. I took tums and then finally Zantac which I guess helped."

"When one symptom ends a new one begins. Every time I go to the ER they tell me nothings wrong and I feel like an idiot. My anxiety is so high right now. Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. My husband, daughter, and I live about 6 hours away from family and this whole process has been such a rollercoaster. I’m just tired of not being believed by doctors. Or having to ask for certain tests. With the heart stuff I had to cold email a random doctor who thankfully responded. I’ve had to deal with doctors just stop responding to me like I’m an annoyance when all I want is to feel better. I have a toddler and I’m finishing up my PhD. I have so much left to do and I feel like my body is  slowing me down."
I'm a male and 25.

"Hey all,"
Sorry for the wall of text. I feel super helpless and I don't know what to do anymore.
"I know I'm getting borderline paranoid, but I just had my lip biopsy come back negative (that is, grade 1 Chisholm and Mason, so slight infiltration only). All my antibodies came back negative, Schirmer test only slightly indicative."
"I have had a lot of health issues for the past few years and the doctors try to explain it by psychosomatic reasons. I can see that my sleeping problems, fatigue, loss of appetite etc could all come from there. However, I have days when I just hurt all over, all the joints in my back, hip, knee and even feet hurt at a time, I have had neuropathy in my right arm for almost a year now (tingling sensation almost every day) and on some days pain and sensitivity around my jaw/ear area. I also have chronic sinusitis and had to undergo surgery, but every cold I catch just stays with me forever. I've had those pains and ailments occasionally since I was a child, always before, during and after I was ""sick"" for a few days or even weeks, kind of like flares in retrospect. I've had a genetic test done which showed increased chance of Sjogren's. That was after I've had most of the symptoms for about half a year, so nothing I'm trying to construct anything."
"After the lip biopsy came back negative yesterday, the only option that's left is go back to antidepressants and therapy. I am well aware that a lot of symptoms could be described as being psychosomatic in nature. But not all of them. I feel like I'm not in touch with my body anymore. Every cell of my body is screaming that there's something wrong, that there must be a physical reason for how I feel. I've had a depression before and it felt way different. This feels like all my bodily ailments just tear my mental health apart, and I can't prove it to anyone. I'm willing to start taking antidepressants and work on therapy, but I just need to know if there's any chance something physical could have been missed. I read that lip biopsies could come back false negative especially in smokers, which I am. Does anyone happen to know of some rare cases where Sjogren's was only later diagnosed? Thanks all, hope you're doing alright everyone Xx"
"Well I'm here so of course my mouth is dry and I was wondering if A. The dry mouth lozenges work and B. Is there any difference between those and sugar free hard candy? I already drink a ton of water a day, probably close to a gallon a day and use the moisturizing mouth rinses at home but I'm looking for more options."
It started two days ago. They can last me up to 2/3 weeks.

I’ve had a bit of a stressful week or so and I think that has caused it.

I fainted during my gym class on Tuesday and have felt tired and achey every since. My eyes are so sore and red :(

I know it will eventually end. But I am wanting to go for drinks with my work crew in two days. I never go out because my body (and bank!) never lets me! And I was so excited about this night.

"Any home remedy’s you guys use for red eyes, achey joints or tiredness? My eyes are my biggest issue because I hate to go out in public when I look like this. I’m asking for home remedy’s because I have all the eye drops and what not from the doc. But when I’m flaring nothing really helps."

Thanks fellow sjogreys x
Hey guys. I’m 19 years old and i recently got blood work done and it came back saying i tested positive for nuclear antibodies. I then took another one to dig deeper and it said my rheumatoid factor is 181 and i also tested positive SS-A (sjogrens) lately I’ve been having pretty dry mouth and i feel tired i don’t know if it’s because of the test results that I’m noticing now and being paranoid or? I haven’t been to the rheumatologist yet because it’s very hard to get an appointment where i live (about 9 months) i honestly feel completely normal besides being super thirsty all the time. Is having a 181 rheumatoid factor bad? If anyone can answer my questions with experience anything would help and i would really appreciate it also wondering for people who got diagnosed with sjogrens is this how it starts and then gets worse?
And do you get sore throat from time to time?
"Hi everyone, I am a graduate student who is currently doing a research project on dry mouth (xerostomia). After some research, I realized that dry mouth is a major symptom of Sjögren's syndrome and I really want to know how do people feel about the current products within the oral care market and what do you think the brands can do better to offer a better experience for dry mouth patients? Any recommendations, pros, and cons for brands that you've used before/using now?"
"Hi I have been diagnosed with shjogren and I have tried these two anti malarial medication; Hydrocholoquine @ 50mg and Methroxate @ 2.5mg, and these medication feels too harsh for me even at that low dosage. My body feels very numb, I get headaches, my stiffness worsens and I have fainted 3 times during subway ride due to these medication."


Is there any alternative anti malarial medication for shogren that is less harsh than either of these 2?

"Hey Everyone, I was diagnosed over 5 years ago now, and have since added lupus to the line-up (that was fun). Anyway, I am a professional writer and recently started a new blog where I am hoping to create a really great resource for other people, like me, who get diagnosed and hit the internet to find ideas and build community. I wish I had found Reddit back then! ha!"

"Hi all. I’ve been experiencing dry mouth for about 2 months now and it is driving me absolutely mad. I went to see a doctor a few days ago and he didn’t even look at my mouth, just gave me anxiety and antidepressant medications, as he thinks my mouth is dry due to stress and anxiety, because by his words, I look totally healthy. Mind you, I do have really bad anxiety. I am seeing a different doctor on Tuesday. I am concerned I may have Sjögren’s. What tests should I ask for so I can be sure?"

"Hello I’m a F/25 I was diagnosed with Sjögrens at 23 years old. I am currently seeing Rheumatologist, Cardiologists, Pulmonologist, Nerologiest, Gastroenterologist, and urologist."
"I have interstitial cystitis, gastrointestinal problems due to lack of mucous lining in both my stomach and bladder which causes the walls to bleed. I also have tachycardia, and low blood pressure. I just began seeing the pulmonologist because of shortness of breath and problems breathing at night. I’m just wondering if people had similar problems because it’s getting worse and it’s affecting my work to the point my boss wants me to be on disability. I was on temporary disability for 2 months and it made some improvements."
Hi all. Been suffering with unexplained health issues for a long time. Gotten much worse over the past year. Been seeing TONS of doctors and all tests come back normal. Currently seeing my second rheumatologist - someone who is known for “finding stuff no one else can find.”

Just got a bunch of results back. ANA and CRP are normal. SSA and SSB also normal.

"However, doc did an “Early Sjogrens Panel” that came up with some interesting results. Carbonic Anhydrase VI IgG was super high, Carbonic Anhydrase VI IgM was high, and Parotid Spec IgG was high. Also have a high A/G ratio."

"Been googling around to figure out what this might mean (I’m a professional researcher so I like to be informed and I know where to look and how to evaluate sources). I know more tests are needed for definitive diagnosis, but from what I’ve read it’s unclear if this panel is actually a good indicator of anything (some sources say it’s a good indicator of possible Sjogrens, some say it doesn’t mean much). Obviously I plan to talk to my doctor, but my appointment isn’t for another week and a half and I would like to have some idea what is going on when I go into the appointment."

"Sjogrens seems to make a LOT of sense for me and my symptoms, but after being told over and over that it’s all in my head, I’m very skeptical that this test means anything."

TL;DR high values of Carbonic Anhydrase VI and Parotid Spec. Anyone familiar with these? Does this actually mean anything? Do you have any reliable resources on this?

Thanks for reading!
"Has anyone had kidney issues with Sjogrens? I believe I may, and my rheumatologist is shrugging it off. Naturally going for a second opinion. Thanks and be well."
Hi all-

"Has anyone had any luck with an anti-inflammatory diet and helping with symptoms and such? If so, do you have a book/site you could please recommend? There's a lot out there and wondering what to trust."

Thank you so much :) :)
"I was diagnosed with sjogrens around 3 years ago, having had symptoms for about six months prior. The Dr thinks it could be secondary to lupus but this hasn't been confirmed."

"My issue at the moment is that all my symptoms have been particularly bad over the last few months and I'm right in the middle of my PhD. A lot of my research involves going out on fieldwork in cold, wet weather, a lot of walking in difficult terrain and long days - fun right?"

"To date I've sort of just powered through but lately I'm finding it more and more difficult. I haven't previously mentioned my diagnosis to my supervisor as I like to keep things private but I'm thinking I will have to as I don't think I can continue with my work load. The main issue with this is my supervisor is the most demanding, difficult person I have ever worked with. He thinks nothing of doing a 13/14 hour day of fieldwork himself and expects everyone to be of the same standard."

I suppose I'm just looking for any advice people have regarding informing their boss/ supervisor about medical issues or anything that could make my work more bearable. Also I'm just having a bit of a rant haha

Thanks 😊
"Hi everyone,"

"Sorry if this is long, I felt it would be best to describe my problems thoroughly. I'm just curious about some problems I've been having for a little over the past year that have been driving me wild and if it could possibly be related to sjogrens. Some of these problems began after having a Septoplasty about a year ago so I have no idea if they could be related to that."

"Edit: If it is helpful at all, I am a 21 year old male living in the Midwest of the US"

Dryness related symptoms:

* **Dry eyes:** This one I've actually had as long as I can remember. It isn't very severe but I find it get's worse in the winter and is at its worse when I'm in public walking around for an extended period of time and when I first wake up in the morning (if i don't use eye drops first thing in the morning it feels like there's shards of glass in my eyes). I had Lasik about 4 months ago and a very common side effect is dry eyes but surprisingly I've actually noticed a slight improvement in my dry eyes since getting it.
"* **Extremely** **dry throat:** This one is almost unbearable. I will wake up every morning with the back of my throat completely barren, 0 moisture. It hurts very bad but thankfully get's better if I take a hot shower and inhale the steam.  It also happens less frequently at random times during the day."
* **Dry mouth:** This one is also not very severe and isn't as frequent as the others. My mouth will sometimes become dry and will not improve no matter how much water I drink. Between this and the dry throat I am almost always consuming liquids.
* **Dry nose:** I often wake up with dried blood in my nose
"* **Dry skin:** I have to moisturize daily, especially my arms, hands, and face."

"I have tried many humidifiers, none of which help at all. My home even has a humidifier built into the heater/AC."

"Edit: For the mouth/throat related symptoms, I feel it is worth mentioning I have trouble with tonsil stones so that could be the cause."

Other symptoms:

"* **Mild Raynaud's Syndrome:** This also started directly after my surgery. Last winter, completely out of the blue, my fingers began turning solid white whenever I got cold. It was only about 3 of my fingers. This winter, it hasn't been as severe. My fingers have not turned white but my hands are cold 90% of the time and go numb."
"* **Joint/Muscle pain:** These aren't new symptoms either. I get debilitating pain in my elbow and knee joints along with pain in my arm muscles. It happens fairly infrequently though, maybe once a week. I have no joint swelling."
* **Fatigue:** Have very little energy and often feel tired despite having not done anything.
* **Post Nasal drip:** Ever since my septoplasty I have had globs of snot pouring down the back of my throat. I spit up probably 10-15 loogies a day. It's also annoying because due to the dryness of my throat they often become dried and stuck to the back of my throat causing discomfort.

"I recently had a lot of blood work done due to the joint/muscle pain and fatigue, some related to autoimmune disorders (mostly pertaining to Rheumatoid arthritis). Nothing seems to indicate any autoimmune dysfunction."

* **ANA:** Negative
* **ESR:** 2 (range <15)
* **C-Reactive Protein:** .4 (range <8)
* **CCP Antibody IGG:** <16 (range <20)

"Would these symptoms be a strong case for sjogrens and is it a possibility despite the blood work? None of my symptoms are very debilitating, they all seems somewhat mild but are very annoying. I would appreciate any insight you have to offer."
"I'm at the end of my rope with the fatigue.  The dryness is an  ongoing PITA, but it's the fatigue I can no longer deal with.  My rheumatologist treats me like a giant whiner and has told me just to buck up and maybe I need a sleep study! She doesn't take me seriously because I'm not in enough pain to be interesting and she is also kind of off putting. I am tired of being tired."

I just want to come home from work and walk my dog again.  Does plaquenil work? I know it takes months to have any effect.
What does it mean if Sjogrens A Ab came back positive but Sjogrens B Ab came back negative. I'm new to all of this and don't have a rheumatology appt until February. Thanks in advance!

I was diagnosed with lupus about 3 years ago. I’ve gone back and forth between feeling great and not being able to get out of bed. I’m on plaquinil and imuran. Right before thanksgiving I ended up in the ER due to severe swelling in my glands and insane pain. I looked like Jaba the Hut. No joke. 10 days of antibiotics for a staff infection in my submandibular glands lead to thrush. At my last rheumatology appointment he wanted to do an ultrasound that found significant inflammation in both salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) and structural damage in my parotid glands. That let to a Sjogrens diagnosis. My bloodwork wasn’t positive for the ANA markers but my aPS/PT Igm was crazy high. I’m kind of freaking out. I had no idea that inflammation was happening so what else is being damaged in my body? I don’t know what all of this together looks like or what that high IgM number means. I’ve tried to research it but it makes no sense. His office is great and will answer any questions but I hate calling every day when I think of something new. He prescribed medication to increase saliva and I haven’t taken it. I don’t want to put more in my body but he made it sound like if I don’t I’m risking additional damage to other things. I’ve started researching the autoimmune diet and I’ll probably try it after the holidays. I don’t really know what my question is. Maybe just....does anyone else have similar diagnosis?  What should I be worried about/ looking for. Thanks for reading this long post and any help you can provide.

"Hi everyone,"

"I must be going through a flare but my tongue is sore on the right side as if I bit it, but I have not. Every time I talk, eat, swallow, etc. it's painful. I used biotene to no avail. Does anyone have this happen? It's awful and I'm trying to rule out that it's anything else. It's an annoying, constant, dull pain. UGH!"
"My mouth gets irritated from time to time... and then eating certain foods is painful. Does anyone else have this problem? If so, what are some of your go to remedies, over the counter and/or prescription?"
"I was at my colorectal doctor (yes, Sjogrens can attack/ dry that area out) and told her about this weird thing I’ve been experiencing once every couple of weeks/ months: I will have a terrible gut-wrenching pain (literally) to the point I can’t talk through it, then run to the bathroom and have a toilet full of blood. It’s red, which I have heard is less concerning and then no fever/ follow up pain. She told me I could be having an intestinal ischemia? Or IBD? Anyone experience this? I know this is TMI."
This is me being curious rather than seeking medical advice by the way.

"For over a decade, my boyfriend has suffered from something his GP originally thought was Sjogren's. But his lip biopsy was negative so it just got forgotten about by the doctors, but he's still suffering. He has permanently dry lips and eyes - lips he uses moisturiser several times a day and eyes he wears non-prescription glasses to shield them but says the drops  don't help much. He had the eye test where they put a strip of paper on the eye and the opthamologist said the strip was completely dry. He has also had bouts of unexplained severe anaemia. They looked for internal bleeding but didn't find anything. He also has persistent heartburn that he takes medication for. I looked up Sjogren's and saw that anaemia and heartburn can be symptoms so I let him know - he wasn't aware."

"Like I say, I'm just a curious person. An unanswered question nags at me. He's not too bothered at the moment, I don't think, he seems accustomed to it, but I just want to know - could the biopsy be a false negative or is it definitive? Because it just seems so weird to me that you can have so many chronic - i.e. 24/7 - symptoms of Sjogren's and not have Sjorgren's!"
"I’m not diagnosed yet, but seeing a rheum soon. I know the treatment is essentially “moisturize and hydrate”... do those things actually improve your symptoms? I’m finding that hydration doesn’t really make a difference for me."
"Have you noticed any difference taking it, positive or negative? Any side effects? Tell me everything you have to say about Plaquenil!"
"Hi all, I got some tests done recently and discovered that I am very prone to blood clots. After some googling (which is always a bad idea) I'm kind of freaking out. I'm only 25, I've been taking the pill for 4 years hoping that I would would be sexually active, and I haven't been and now I have to stop taking the pill or I could increase my chances of dying. Also  - sorry to be graphic - the sjogrens is making me dry up which seems like a joke because I haven't had a boyfriend in years and haven't had sex in longer. The next time I do I'm sure it will be super uncomfortable because of how dry I always am and will have higher chance of getting a pregnancy that I probably couldn't support if I wanted to because of the blood clot thing. Which might never happen anyway if I get a blood clot that kills me before then. Sorry for the pessimism. I don't actually think I'm going to die anytime soon, but knowing that it's possible and being alone through this is terrifying and awful. I hope you're all having a better night then me."

"I need some recommendations for products for dry skin, skin in general, and makeup.  I can't use shea butter or avocado oil so that rules out quite a few lotions. It seems like lotions don't work so right now I have been using oil to help with the itchies but I don't know if that is the way to go. My Sjogren's is primary and affects more than eyes and throat. I take Plaquenil, Meloxicam, and Cymbalta mainly for it. Showers make it better but worse at same time.  I seriously think my body hates me.  What do you guys do for your Sjogrens?"
My dry eyes are getting worse.   Just using OTC tears type of drops.   Are prescription drops more effective?
This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if this is confusing or breaks a rule.

"I'm a 25 yr old female (don't know if that information helps) and I was just diagnosed with Sjogren's in December after a TON of blood work, a biopsy, and a long wait to get an appointment at the special autoimmune center at the local University."

My new rheumatologist put me on Plaquenil to help with the pain I was feeling in my glands and to hopefully help with how exhausted I am all the time. She also had me go to my eye doctor to check up on how dry my eyes are.

"When I saw my eye doctor, she took pictures of my eyes because she said it was good to get a baseline when taking Plaquenil because after many years it can cause something called Bull's eye Maculopathy.  When the pictures came out, she said she already saw the beginning of Bull's Eye Maculopathy and after sending the report to my rheumatologist they decided it would be best for me to stop the Plaquenil."

"My next appointment with my rheumatologist isn't until July 3rd and basically my treatment is at a stand still. I'm still in a lot of pain, am not feeling good, and am extremely exhausted. This has also started affecting my performance at work and I'm a little worried about that as well. I'm still new to all this and am still learning but I feel so discouraged right now and have no idea what to do to help these symptoms."
"Hey guys, can somebody please help me out? My moms health has taken a turn for the worse, she’s had pulmonary fibrosis for a few years along with a plethora of other issues. Now I understand that she’s dealing with Sjogrens. It most definitely shows in her eye lids and around her throat. She’s in good spirits (getting there anyways) but I can tell that this issue is really hurting her at the moment. Her doctors aren’t doing anything for it, so I’m trying the best I can to try and help her. This is only my second time visiting the mainland in the last eight months so I was unaware of this issue and how much pain it is causing her.  I could read online about it but Reddit has always given me the most honest and supportive answers I seek so I value the input I receive here much more than most places. I’m sorry if this post is poorly written, I just got off the plane a few hours ago and after spending some time with her my heart is breaking apart. My grammar and spelling is taking a back seat to the point of my post. If anybody has info on anything and everything I can do in any way to help her please let me know. Diet? Pills? Tricks? Theories? Anything helps. I would give everything I have if she could just have one day without pain. Thank you for your time. ✌️"
"I was doing really well having just started low-dose naltrexone, but got hit with a slight chest cold that only lasted a few days then turned into weeks of extreme fatique. The thing is my husband has the fatigue, too (he NEVER gets sick). His is over the past couple of days, but mine is still to the bone. I feel like I'm stuck to the mattress and the very effort of unsticking is just too much. We work from home so it isn't that bad, financially, just sucks."

Even getting out for groceries on my good days
is utterly exhausting.
Hi I have just 3 weeks ago been diagnosed with Primary Sjogrens. I dont have any other auto immune
"diseases that many with Sjogrens seem to have. I may post my 3 year saga that has really ruined my life but in the meantime Im looking for advice or anyones experience with the medication Mycophenolate also called Cellcept. The symptoms I have been really struggling with (including the eyes, mouth etc) are brain fog, severe lack of concentration, confusion, low energy, and body aches and pain. This is affecting my ability to really do my job. My Rheumatologist put me on the Mycophenolate an immunosuppressant normally used for organ transplant patients to not reject a new heart/kidney etc. (scary). I have been on it for about 2 1/2 weeks now. 2 - 500 mg twice a day (4000mg total) I have not had any reaction so far..good or bad. Maybe a little headache from it. Does anyone else take this? or tried it? Any reactions? Did it help with the symptoms above? I cant find that much about it online. A few posts on other sites that say it gave others their life back by fixing some of the issues I mentioned but not how..how long it took, what it felt like, etc. Any advice would be appreciated. The only other meds Im on are the Cevimeline HCL to increase saliva with seems to help a bit along with all the other now constant things like Biotene, Xylmelts, eye drops etc Thank you"
"My wife has an H Pylori infection and it seems like this infection can be related to Sjogrens in some way.  Any of you guys get this infection too? It seems like even if you get rid of it, you are doomed to having lifelong stomach pain.  She has these painful flare ups if she eats the wrong thing.  Any of this sound familiar?"
20 yr old female with sjögrens!! any tips for vaginal dryness?


"Hello,"

"I have not been diagnosed yet, but due to my experience and symptoms I'm sure it is sjogrens."

"One really odd thing that is happening- during my period my lips get a plaque on them, not quite like chapped lips but it's dry, burning and crusty on the outer parts of my lips. Also, the corners of my mouth have open, scabby sores. It bleeds when I try to eat. Nothing big or acidic for me at these times because it'll rip and burn the corners of my mouth."

Do you get this? What can I do aside from chapstick to help? Thanks in advance. This is my very first post!
I've been getting these episodes that suddenly start in the evening and end sometime in the morning. No fever. No food poisoning. Just.... wtf?
I just started Xiidra and the taste it produces in my mouth is horrific. I'm reading online that it goes away quickly for most but it's last most of the day for me. Has anyone else experienced this? I was really looking forward to giving this a go but I just almost threw up so I think I need to stop.
"Hi, my mom is diagnosed with Sjogren's and her otolarynologist wants to give her chemotherapy."

What was your experience with chemotherapy? Were there side effects?
"A year or two ago, my test results showed my SSA/B antibodies at <.1. Because I continue to suffer from what feels like a chronic state of dehydration despite drinking a ton, my PCP retested me.  The result?  <.2😂  So, still within normal range, and not much of a difference, but could that tiny increase mean something?  Just curious if anyone knows anything about test results!"
Hi all.  I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.  First let me say I know nobody can diagnose me here and that I plan to consult a doctor soon.  I'm just trying to calm my anxiety until then and sort out what to say when I *do* get in :)

______________________________________________

"Background:  I'm 31, have suffered chronic fatigue since I got my period at age 12 (though it's much better when I'm taking birth control pills) & am experiencing progressive dryness throughout my body for the past decade or so."

**EYES**

"When I moved to the desert 10 years ago, my eyes began to have these ""flare ups"" where they would feel like they were full of sand.  I couldn't see anything and would rub them incessantly (bad, I know) for days until it would go away.  They would swell up and look like I had been hit in the face.  No amount of moisturizing drops would help.  It was terrible!  I assumed it was because my contacts were irritating my eyes, but it persisted to a degree even after having LASIK.  (When I had the LASIK, my eye doctor was struck by just how dry my eyes were.  He put in punctal plugs, aka tear duct plugs to help keep the moisture in.  That has helped tremendously but, *boy*, was it unpleasant to have those 8"" needles going into my eyes)!  :O"

**TEETH**

"In the last 6-7 years or so, I've started to develop cavities along the gumline of my back teeth despite brushing daily and flossing regularly.  My mouth is often bone dry despite using Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash and drinking tons of water.  These cavities seem to spread much faster than the kind that form on the top of the teeth, causing me to require several extractions.  I never used to get these gumline cavities in the past until about 7 years ago; now they're the only kind I get.  I do eat a lot of sweets as a side effect of my medication, so I'm sure that contributes somewhat."

**SKIN**

"In the last 2-3 years, my scalp has become incredibly dry as well.  It was always oily due to my super-fine and oily hair, but now it's dry and full of large dandruff flakes.  My hair stylist actually thought the dandruff was lice until I explained that it wasn't.  I've never been so humiliated!  Aargh!"

**OTHER SYMPTOMS**

"During this 7-10 year time frame, a few other worrying symptoms have cropped up.  Vaginal dryness being one of them, but also total loss of sex drive (due to vaginal dryness? Or not?  I'm not sure).  My abdomen has become bloated and I've gained weight I can't seem to lose no matter what I do.  And I've always had ""irritable bladder"" aka burning caused by certain substances like caffeine & not drinking enough water.  All my blood tests & routine checkups come out normal."

**POSSIBLE CAUSES**

"I know these sound like definite Sjogren's symptoms, and maybe they are, but there are some other things that could be muddying the waters."

"First, I live in a desert climate that is sunny 360 days a year and gets about 1/2 inch of rain per year...if that.  Summer temps get to 120 degrees regularly.  In short, it's hot and dry here, unlike the place I grew up.  Some of these symptoms began when I moved here, such as the dry eye flare ups."

"Secondly, I take a lot of medications that can cause dryness as a side effect.  Here are just a few that come to mind:  dicyclomine, oxycodone, propylhexedrine, diphenhydramine, doxylamine succinate, cannabis & Prozac.  Most of these are taken daily or semi-daily for medical conditions."

______________________________________________

"I know everyone's symptoms are somewhat different, but how much of this resonates with you Sjogren's folks?  Did your symptoms set in over a long period, or did you just wake up with the disease?  Do you think it could be the medications and desert climate causing my symptoms, or is it likely something more serious?  I just don't know what to think anymore."

Thanks for listening <3



"My teeth started randomly breaking 10 year ago. About 1 every 3 months like clockwork. My last 16 were pulled due to huge infections followed by lupus flares. The physical pain is nothing compared to the psychological number it does on you. Between the lupus and this, you literally feel like you are falling apart,"

Thank God for cosmetic dentistry. Always remember your biotene kids.

At least I won't have any future dental problems.
"I'm a 23 year old female who's been suffering from extreme dryness for years and I'm having Sjogren's testing done tomorrow but have not been officially diagnosed. For the last several years I have noticed the dryness continually worsening in my eyes, vagina, and especially in the mouth area. I wake up multiple times a night and my mouth is as dry as a desert and even during the day I'm always hyperaware of how uncomfortable it is. I tried all otc products and have been put on salagen and evoxac which was the only way I could get some sleep but unfortunately over time those seem to not be working as well and I don't think I can handle the extreme discomfort the dry mouth is giving me all the time and I've also had a lot of mouth sores, plaque, tonsil stones, and white tongue and I have not been able to get rid of any of it. I feel like I don't have anymore options and was hoping someone could give me advice here."
"After years of suffering from a while range of issues from GI to to chronic pain, the one doctor to put it ask together was an ophthalmologist. Yeah, I know it's the hall mark symptom, but I had seen other eye doctors and they hadn't caught it either."

"Anyway, about a year ago I started in with extremely irritated and dry eyes like never before. I just kind of delt with it until it started effecting my vision. I assumed it was bad contacts and got several new scripts. Finally, talking to an ophthalmologist neighbor he wanted me to come in. Recently, I had gone on a strict diet with no sugars out sweats. Which is something I always had on me. Well my mouth had become painfully dry as well. He almost fell over himself at how bad things were. Anyway, after several tests, here I am. In one vein, I'm a man in his forties who finally had an explanation for nearly all the health problems that plagued me through my life. On the other hand, I'm a bit worried."

"So what's next. What should I expect. I'm making a few calls to get recommendations on rheumatologists. Anyway, i know that every topic has a subreddit, but thanks for existing."
"Hello! I was wanting to hear about what kind of GI problems other sjogren-ites experience. I'm 25 and have been diagnosed for about 4 years and only recently, the past few months, have I been having a lot more stomach issues. And it's starting to get worse. Basically, I get intestinal pain or stomach cramps almost daily after eating, and some days I feel really bloated. I actually started thinking I might have another issue like Celiac or something, but then I remember Sjogrens CAN cause GI problems and maybe it's all from that. I am very unfortunately uninsured at the moment, though there is a free/sliding-scale fee clinic in my area and I'm hoping I might be able to get an appointment there soon. Just wanted to hear if anyone else experiences problems like this, or if anyone thinks this might be something else. Thanks!"
"Hi all - 32 yr old female here.  Has anyone else experienced numbness/weakness as a symptom with SS? I just started having the dry mouth really bad a few months ago, and then other symptoms (fatigue, mild joint pain, tingling in the hands and feet, and extremities being ""asleep"" in the morning when I wake up) over the past few weeks.  Now I'm having intermittent numbness/weakness in my legs, arms, and face which is scaring the crap out of me. Is this ""normal""? Is there any medicine that is helpful? I've read good things about plaquenil but cannot find where that would be helpful for this.  The first appt I could get with a rheumy isn't for another two months, so I have yet to even have an official dx.  What's somewhat annoying is that all of my blood work is negative/normal so I've not had much luck in getting my PCP to take me seriously.  Advice/suggestions/positive tidbits would be appreciated.... I feel like I'm going off the deep end not knowing how this will progress or what to expect next."
"After a two-month bout of terrible digestive issues (which a gastroenterologist was sure would be colitis, only to find out it wasn't) a lab test revealed my antinuclear bodies are 1:320. In addition to the digestive issues, I've been very fatigued, had an extremely dry mouth, woken up with dry eyes,  had parched skin, and had weird tingling in my hands and feet. Does this sound familiar to anyone or seem to point to anything?"

"Hello, I'm a 22F diagnosed within the past year. The primary symptom I experience is extremely dry eyes on about 2-5 random days each week. When I say severe, I mean I cannot open my eyes fully past a squint because it feels like a fan is blowing into my eyes. They burn all day and only feel relieved if I lay down and keep them closed. I'm on Restasis, use Systane preservative-free vials, on Evoxac, take fish oil supplements, use baby shampoo scrub and Avenova eyelid scrib, and use heated goggles. I have also tried pretty much every eyedrop/gel/ointment available in drugstores. I recently have even tried giving up gluten because I figured it's worth a shot. These ""bad eye days,"" combined with my clinical depression, make it really hard to get out of bed. It's caused me to miss so much class that I have lost hope in ever attending Physician Assistant school. PLEASE any advice helps!!!!"
"Hi everyone, so I recently was diagnosed after a blood test, that I have Sjögren's, I had dry mouth and dry eyes but I had no idea that I would have an autoimmune disease. Also my thyroid wasn't working properly and now I am taking some kind a thyroid medicine. Now as of the moment my doctor is saying I have primary but she isn't 100 percent sure if it's secondary, I am a little nervous and was wondering if anyone was diagnosed with Sjögren's and then later diagnosed with a secondary autoimmune disorder, also any tips on how to manager it would be greatly appreciated. My Mother has Multiple Sclerosis so autoimmune disorders are not common within my family. Is there anything I should by wary with in the future? Thank you."

"Hello everyone,"

I am new to the group (and reddit as well)

My father likely has sjogren's (I say likely because there was no official confirmation but doctors said its probably is)

He is 51 years old and always been almost anal about being healthy. He picked off a piece of flesh under his tongue and got a saliva glad infection that caused his sjogren's to blossom in his mouth.

It has been 3 months since the initial dr visit and it still is effecting his mouth. Luckily he has not complained of eye issues.

"Right now he is on Plaquenil, Xanex and takes countless saliva lozenges and gum to battle the dry mouth."

"He has fallen into a depression, he doesn't even feel like getting out of bed somedays and is very fearful that he has to live with this, especially the constant lozenges and gum. He also has a tremendous amount of guilt thinking he caused this and it would never have happened if not for that one moment (I tell him not so since his mother had lupus and its genetic)"

"I want to help him as much as I can, I encourage him, I talk to him daily, but he still stays in his rut. I know, trust me I know this is not any kind of instant fix, its a long term thing that time will help with."

"Does anyone have any suggestions, advice, anything for my father and myself who is supporting him through this?"

"I will be around and would love to get some supporting informations, tips."

Thank You all so much

Sjögren's is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it presents symptoms common with many other ailments. It is also incurable.

My mom was recently diagnosed with Sjogrens and Rheumatoid Arthritis. She's 61.

"I think she's gotten so used to having a long list of health problems, that this is just another one to add on. But I'm glad she finally has a diagnosis and can start finding some answers."

Is there anything I can do that you've found helpful from your family members? Either for the early stages of later on down the road.

Thank you. :)
"Hi everyone, since learning that a dear friend of mine has pSS I've tried to use my skills as a researcher to better understand the disease, the variants, the outcomes, the whole she-bang.  I've accumulated quite a bit of knowledge and a decent number of scientific articles on relevant topics.  The whole reason I did this was because I thought the best way to help was to provide knowledge and dispel fear and then I thought, why not share that with as many people as can benefit from it?  So I wanted to share the articles I've downloaded so far in a [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2WMn56XoGCBfkVWcmdGQkRyOXctMDltUFdfcno0ZVR2azdYVmpEWUJra0tTZDlURUM1MUU&usp=sharing)."

"As a neuroscientist myself, there is a special focus on central nervous system features in some of the articles but other important topics like efficacy of drugs and complications in pregnancy (which I'm relieved to say are quite minimal and controllable) are also scattered throughout."

"If you have any burning questions (or non-burning questions) about things on the research side or for clarification of something in an article (there is a lot of jargon), please feel free to ask here and I will tell you what I've discovered through my research or track down something that can and add it to the folder.  I hope people can find these useful!"

EDIT: I updated the names of the articles to make it easier to find articles related to your questions
"I've been having absolutely horrible heartburn that keeps me from sleeping (apparently the lack of saliva means more stomach acid ). Besides medication, does anyone have any remedies? Maybe food or herbs that help?"
"She was diagnosed a few months ago, but has probably had it to some degree for years.  She's 30, and we've been married 4 yrs.  the fatigue is the worst of it for her, I don't know where she is on the severity spectrum, if there is such a thing. All I know is that it has put a serious strain on our marriage, and I'm not sure how to set my expectations with her, and how to balance being tough and motivating with nuturing and forgiving.  She has had anxiety/depression since I've known her, and one thing is for sure, sometimes tough love is the only thing that can bring her out of a funk.  But now, I am the sole provider, I'm left with the lions share of household chores, and when she does get out of bed she seems to only be able to complain and be miserable.  I can't begin to understand what she feels like, but don't kid yourself...we all have our personal shit that we have to deal with.  Last spring I was in a bad accident and broke my pelvis, knee and jaw...I was really messed up.  But once I was done with surgeries, even when I didn't want to, and was hurting, I got back to work and life...really because I had no choice.  Everybody has adversity...sometimes I feel like she has just given up to her condition.  So my question is: how can I gauge my expectations of her with Sjogrens, and how can we manage to have any kind of fruitful relationship when Sjogrens rules her life?"
We are doing research at the Celiac Disease Foundation.  Please take the short survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/glutenfreedietadherence

Stay moist my friends.




"Turns out hand, foot and mouth disease is running rampant in my area and that's what caused the worsening of my symptoms. My rheumy didn't realize that's what it was the first time. Second time I went in, I was concerned the plaquenil was causing a rash. I've never been so relieved to find out I was just ""sick"" - that it'd improve. It still sucks but my mouth is better and that's a huge relief. Now I just need the skin eruptions to stop appearing. It's amazing how much the fatigue is helped by having hope."

Over the last little while I have noticed that I have periods of time where i feel air hunger and start to get short of breath. I'm not sure if it is because my dry mouth is reaching newer and more epic levels of being horrible or if I should be worrying about my lungs.

"I know I should tell my doctor. I keep meaning to bring it up but it isn't constant so I tend to mean to tel him, the symptoms go away and it gets replaced with a more constant problem or a problem that is more current. I have added it into my symptom tracker so I can keep track of how often it's happening and hopefully jog my memory when I am in with my gp."

Anyone else gone through similar? I would love for suggestions on how to prevent it from happening or to reduce the symptoms.
"I've always had issues with this, so I guess my Sjogren's diagnosis wasn't entirely unexpected."

"But, to get a little more TMI. About 6 months before I started developing severe symptoms of lupus and sjogren's (the symptoms came over night, it seemed, and then a month later I was in the hospital), I went to the gynecologist to get a pap smear. I've had them before and they've always been a bit uncomfortable."

"But this time, the literal walls of my vagina were stinging and burning when simply touched by the speculum. My provider said she had no idea what could cause that, and that there was nothing in the procedure that would cause stinging pain. I don't have any STDS, and I take yeast infection medication when needed."

Is it safe to say that what happened had to do with Sjogren's?

"I'm taking Evoxac now, as needed, but now I'm a bit terrified. I haven't had any intimate relations, so I'm a bit worried that when that happens it'll be a repeat of my pap smear."

Any suggestions/advice?
"Primary vs secondary- Sjögren’s is usually classified by a clinician as either primary or secondary. Primary Sjögren’s occurs by itself and secondary Sjögren’s occurs when another connective tissue disease is present.  Both are systemic diseases, meaning they can affect many systems in the body, and they occur with about equal frequency. The primary form causes early and gradually progressive decreased function in the lacrimal and salivary glands, and can include a variety of extraglandular conditions. The secondary form occurs in people who already have another autoimmune connective tissue disease, most commonly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These people then develop dry eyes or dry mouth.

Almost three years ago I was diagnosed with Crohns Disease after several months of bleeding and diarrhea that finally got so bad other people noticed and forced me to got get looked at. Doctors found a gross bleeding ulcer in my colon and we've documented inflammation in my ileum multiple times since then.

"But now, the bleeding is completely under control, and i think the inflammation is mostly under control as well. Or at least is MUCH better than it was."

"However I continue to have real issues eating (nausea and narrowed stool, pain pain and more pain) (sorry if tmi)."

The rheumatologist I saw was a pretty serious asshole (and I'm used to dealing with doctors) and I haven't yet sought out someone else.  I am now finally get around to it though.

"My question is, how extreme do you know of digestive symptoms getting? I don't see inflammation of the gi track as a part of sjogrens, so I'm wary to think I've been misdiagnosed. But I don't see sjogrens and crohns as ""usually"" coexisting.  Even if it doesn't cause inflammation, does it get bad enough that you, or others you know, go days without eating? (Just to not have to deal with it, and to be able to hang out with people, or have a lot of sex etc)"

Thanks guys!

Autoimmune or not?

"Hi all,"

I have been suffering for about 5 years (25/m) with still no diagnosis. I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction.

"The first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop)."

Then around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows:
Dry mouth
Fatigue
"Neurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit)"
Excessive sweating
Derealisation
Sensitivity to loud noise
Sensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight)
Balance/coordination problems
Joint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy)
"Alcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now)"
Wounds take a long time to heal

"I was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp."

"I have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative. Sjogrens syndrome seems to match my symptoms most closely but my rheumatologist doesn't believe in seronegative Sjogrens so has ruled that out, my blood tests were negative as was a lip biopsy."

If anyone can hell I would be forever grateful!
"30 year old female dx with fibromyalgia, bloodwork shows elevated CRP and SED rate. My mother dx with autoimmune disease."

I have struggled the last couple of years with these symptoms and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. But I brought Sjogrens to my doctors attention when my wife told me she thinks I have it. I just wanted to list some of my symptoms with y’all and see what y’all think? I’ll be getting a blood test in a few weeks. The symptoms that bother me the most are:

Cotton mouth always. My tongue feels like sandpaper. I constantly drinking or spraying biotene on my tongue. I always seem to have a white film even though I scrape my tongue twice daily.

Dry eye. Worsens when wearing contacts. I use drops and they burn like hell each time.

"Muscle pain and muscle tightness, chronic. Morning stiffness daily. My back and buttocks are full of knots."

"Extreme fatigue, sometimes severe enough to feel I can’t keep my eyes open or move well. Insomnia at night, every night."

I wake with swollen hands a lot and my joints will be stiff.

Frequent headaches. Probably from muscle tension.

"My teeth have been chipping off a LOT. But, this could be due to me being a horrible grinder in my sleep."

What do y’all think? Does this sound familiar to any of you?
Has anyone has **adverse** reactions to the auto-immune protocol diet?

To those who've had success with AIP: how long into the program before you started noticing changes?

"I'm only a couple weeks in, and I seem to be starting a flare. I certainly wouldn't expect to be noticeably better by this point, but I was hoping not be getting noticeably worse either. It could be coincidence, but I've also heard of some people who feel better when not eating red meat, which I've been doing a lot more of than normal."

Hello my fellow dry friends.
I’m going to be headed to Vegas and LA at the end of November and Beginning of December and I am horrified and delighted at the prospect.
"Every time I fly, I end up with a painfully dry nose and nosebleeds as well as dry/cracked lips."
"I’m sure it’s going to be even worse this time, because being from New Orleans I live in a high humidity area (yet, still suffer, thanks immune system) and I’m literally going to the desert... in the winter. Also, we’re flying from NOLA to Vegas, then a few days later from Vegas to LA, and then from LA back to NOLA. So it’s not just one flight, it’s several, back to back."

"My sinuses are by far the worst part, followed closely with a lack of saliva, and my eyes are pretty well managed with Systane."

"At home, twice daily, I use Emla cream inside my nose to deaden the pain and then use Laneige lip sleeping mask on my lips, and yes, in my nose."
(I use clean q-tips to dip from the pot.)

"To further compound the issue, I have to use scopolamine patches to avoid air sickness (because the fluid in my ears dries up so fast on the plane), and that makes everything EVEN DRIER."

"So, please, if you have any tips or tricks or products that you use I’m looking for suggestions."

I carry my Mario Badescu rosewater hydrating mist in a travel bottle as well to keep my skin as hydrated as possible.

What do you use during air travel??
Anyone else have palpitations and increased heart rate?
"Hello! I am in the midst of auto immune testing... not sure what I have Rheum is thinking Sjogrens. This hasn’t been going on for long but every week my hand and feet swelling, pain, stiffness gets worse. Sometimes it is also burning and neuropathic pain but more often that not feels like I have bad cuts all of my hands- broken toes and fingers. I just started Plaquenil 200mg 2x a day. I have been taking Prednisone for about a month. 10 mg a day for about a month with another 5 added about two weeks ago. I know the Plaquenil takes a while but I am so close to being immobile it is scary- I thought the prednisone even though it is not a great long term option would help. I can’t take NSAIDS and my pin mgmt dr has me on 10mg Methadone 3x a day for back and abdominal pain. I canNt imagine how bad it would be without it all. What do you take that works?! I know the reality is probably being in pain and uncomfortable the rest of my life but this level is not a good place for me. I have tried cbd ointment and topical oils which helps some. Also ice packs, heating pads etc... What have you found that works for you?"
Does this happened to anyone? Mine get inflammed and become tender and painful on/off.
"My mum has primary Sjögrens, and we're always looking for ways to help her with dryness. We found this product called Hydrus that claims to improve hydration over time, and seems marketed at people with Sjögrens. Has anyone tried it? Since we're in the UK we'd have to import it, and we're not keen to do that without finding out more about it in case it's yet another failure that doesn't work. Thank you!"
I haven’t seen anything about Sjorgens and problems with dentures.   Would dry mouth effect the fit of dentures?
"I was just recently diagnosed with Sjogrens, I am 20 years old. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping. Not because of dryness (doesn't seem to be severe at all) or pain. I have swollen lymph node in my armpit and chest area that bother me as well as breathing. I just started Hydroxychloroquine about a week ago and haven't noticed any significant changes at all. Some days I will stay up til about 5am-7am because of uncomfortableness at night that turns into anxiety. Sometimes I will close my eyes and just as I'm about to fall asleep I will gasp for air. I am not sure if it is from anxiety or something else because it happens when I'm not anxious either. I am wondering if all of this is normal? Also, tips on sleeping better or making myself more comfortable? I've already tried Melatonin"
"The technican said they look normal but she only had a cursory glance, I've got a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results who would hopefully have a better look and interpret differently... however if they look health, they won't do a biopsy and I don't know how else I would get a diagnosis without it."

&#x200B;

Did anyone else get similar comments from the technician but your doctor found an issue?
"Hello, all. This is my first post (just joined), and I've very recently realized that this disease exists, and that I suffer from many symptoms of it. Over the past few years I've often been treated for ear infections, which are fairly chronic. A year or so ago it was mentioned that my salivery glands were swollen. This happens more frequently now, and a physician mentioned Sjogren's to me and asked what my other symptoms were. Turns out, my dry eye and mouth issues, pain and inflammation in my extremeties, malaise, and fatigue - even my digestive issues, are associated with Sjogren's. Yesterday, I had blood work done, but it seems like this is just the beginning of a long diagnostic process to determine the root cause."

&#x200B;

"My question is to those who suffer swollen salivery glands. How do you treat it? I've been dealing with this dull, neverending ache and swollen cheeks for what seems like forever. Is there anything that can help relieve some of the pain outside of taking ibuprofen? Any advice?"

&#x200B;

"As I go through the process, I'm sure I will post more frequently, and read through all of the other posts to learn a bit more about Sjogren's and how everyone here deals with it. Thanks for listening."

/fixed typo
"So I have had a tooth with a metal filling for 5+ years that caused me permanent pain and discomfort, if I ate something and my mouth was a bit acidic=PAIN, if I accidentally touched it with a cutlery=Like plugging a battery to it, if it's winter= PAIN PAIN PAIN AND MORE PAIN. Basically I can't keep warm in winter so the metal filling can't be warmed up by my body which then causes throbbing pain from it."


"The dentist who first gave me the stupid metal filling i complained about the pain to for 3 years ever time I saw him and every time he 'mansplained' in a super gaslighty way how it was all in my head or worse he filed it down further making it hurt even more. In the end I gave up and signed up with the local dental hospital and have then spent years on their waiting list to get it sorted and every dentist I've talked to about it in the building all said the same thing; 'No, OF COURSE if metal fillings gives you pain and discomfort we will need to mend it with white material' oh HALLELUJAAAAAHHHH! I was dumb enough to think...."


"Went in today and the dentist fixing the tooth tells me whan I ask 'so they are both mended in white now?'  'yeah no, I used a metal filling on the tooth' (O\_O) WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!"


Being me I of course hope that going home with my new metal filling that doesn't have a crack down it will somehow magically be different this time (the old filling had cracked before it got fixed) and it's not it hurts just the same as the old mending and I've just wasted a whole sedation session on creating the exact same result that had haunted me for 5+ years...


"Having a bad flare up atm and I really REALLY needed this to be the one positive thing that I could get fixed during constant other pain but no, of course not. x\_x I have two teeth with white fillings and they have never caused any problems/pain nor broken for 17+ years. Just feel like a complete idiot for having trusted a dentist again."
I've noticed a predictable daily pattern in the last six months

- 6AM awaken w/ tongue stuck to roof of mouth
- 12PM throat burning
- 3PM hands and feet on fire
- 5PM hands and feet cyanotic and cold
- 6PM THERE ARE RED HOT POKERS IN MY EYES
- 8PM fatigue and joint pain so great should be dead
"- 9PM leg, abdominal edema turned me into Baymax"
- 10PM HOLY FUCK PLEASE KILL ME 😭😭😭
"- 1AM still awake after Ambien, Trazadone"
- 4AM only two hours left until alarm

The pattern is so damn regular that I can't help but think there's a circadian immune response at play.
"A lot of antidepressants if not most, make dry mouth and eyes worse. Has anyone had experience with one being ok. I used to be almost dry free most of the time but had to go back on the meds."
I have had dryness problems since the end of 2017.  I don't produce enough tears.  I have had parasthesia all over my body for months now and strong muscle twitching.  It's worse in my legs but all over.  My hair is dry and more brittle. Some days are better than others but it never goes away.  I have had constant battles with doctors the entire time.  I am tired.  I get fatigued.

I had a neurology test at the hospital recently (the electro conductive test) and it has revealed nothing.  I told them that the advice is that these tests are unrevealing with small fibre neuropathy according to many sources.  I was laughed out the building pretty much.  The Neurologist says there is no cause for concern with what i'm suffering and the GP concurs.  I had a lip biopsy for the Sjogrens.  It has left me with a very uncomfortable aching sensation that hasn't gone away (again nobody believes this).  The results are inconclusive and I have been given the diagnosis of Sicca Syndrome instead.  They did find some inflammation.   I am no further forward with anything.  I have been offered no treatment.
"Anyone able to give me reassurance that you can still successfully produce milk and breastfeed? I preemptively contacted a lactation consultant to see if they were familiar with Sjorens and to just get some advice on what to expect. They said that due to the mammary glands being a part of the exocrine glands, it would potentially cause issues."
"Sorry if it's the wrong place. I currently don't have sjogrens, but my mom (64) does."

"It was so hard for her to get a diagnosis, mainly because in my country is really uncommon and because she had had many other different illnesses and pathologies. She has suffered so much but at least now she has a name for it."

What specific things you suggest I can do to support her? (Other than being generally supporting I mean)

"Back to my question, as I understand autoimmune disorders have a strong genetic component. My mom and I both have hypothyroidism (not sure if Hashimoto's though). I'm 27F and I don't want to be paranoid about Sjogrens or any other AI, but I want to be vigilant and aware of possible symptoms that I shouldn't ignore, or group of symptoms that come together. Are there any tests that I can take maybe yearly to check for something?"

Thank you in advance
"First off, I have a negative ANA screen and long time Hashimoto's sufferer. I am seemingly in perfect health by most any measure. I was referred to a rheumatologist by my opthalmologist. My visit was because of monocular polyopia. I see multiple of everything with each eye independently."

"I was diagnosed with corneal abrasions caused by  keratoconjunctivitis sicca. She asked if my eyes felt dry, if I had trouble with dry mouth, joint pain, or dental issues."

Yes to all! These issues have been progressively causing increasing problems over the last few years with the xerostomia starting around Christmas.

"The rheumatologist didn't want to explore further than the ANA screen, but he did prescribe salagen/pilocarpine 4x per day. It's basically a miracle drug, but it only lasts about 2 hour per dose."

"My question for this group, do any of you also suffer from peripheral neuropathy, Raynaud's, and a constantly burning tongue? These three items are the worst because I can't seem to find relief."
"Hi there! First time posting. I was diagnosed with Sjögrens in 2015. I wore contacts exclusively between 2002-2014, specifically focus dailies from 2004 on. I stopped wearing them because the dryness was unbearable. I didn’t think anything of it until my diagnosis. I attempted to get fitted for contacts in 2017, but the office wasn’t knowledgeable about Sjögrens and therefore unsympathic toward my needs. I’ve since switched offices & at my eye exam today was asked about contacts & decided to give it another shot. I was prescribed total 1 dailies. They felt amazing for the first hour and then got increasingly uncomfortable so I took them out after 4 hours. I was happy with this, I know contacts aren’t for me anymore but I am happy to have found something for those few times a year I might want to wear contacts. The doctor also mentioned a machine called Truetear to promote tear production. Basically you insert it into your nose & it sends a pulse which prompts tear production. He said he first came across the device after a friend’s tear ducts were damaged from chemo & he was prescribed it. My doctor doesn’t actually prescribe the device because the “overheard is too high” but suggested I look into it. He said it cost between $700-1200 for the machine, plus  the cost of the disposable nasal tips."

"Has anyone heard of or used this device? If so, is it worth considering?"

Thank you.
Hey guys and gals! I'm meeting up with my rheumatologist in a week to discuss this new and exciting development in my life: loss of taste!

Has anyone experienced this due to medication side effects or general dryness of the mouth?

"This isn't the most painful thing I've experienced, but it is rather unsettling, and it makes me sad when I eat something delicious only to have it taste like cardboard."
Are Sjogrens and Lupus related? Or are they similar in symptoms? Can you have both?
"Hey everyone. Last night was rough for me. I woke up and my mouth was SO dry. Found out that someone in the house cranked the heat up. Anything over 68 completely dries me up. Very often do I wake up in the middle of the night and stick my face over my cool mister humidifier on full blast and it's like heaven in a jar. So like I said, last night was a rough one. I woke up and held a hot rag (that I wet with water and microwaved) under my eyes and along my jaw, and I didn't notice my eyes are not as irritated today. When I got in the car to leave in the morning I went to do my lipstick in the mirror and saw that my front teeth on the top and bottom have black brown marks around the edges.  I freaked out hoping it was some kind of freakish coffee stains, and used some whitening gel but nope. It just caused them to hurt.  They are very sensitive today and I can feel the difference, over night. This is crazy and I'm so depressed right now. I even switched toothpastes recently because I noticed that regular toothpaste was giving me ulcers. I need to see the dentist asap. What are your stories concerning your gums , mouth, teeth? Should I tell my rhemuatologist about this?"
Does anyone use Xiidra? I was written a prescription and it will be $260 a month after insurance. How much better does it work versus Otc drops? Thanks!!
"A little background first....I was diagnosed with Sjogren's about five years and Celiac a little over a year ago. My Celiac is basically under control, thankfully, but I've been in a Sjogren's flare for about the last couple of months. Every day after lunch, I have a totally random muscle start to hurt and a painful knot starts to form. It's basically gone the next day. The muscle can be the quad, calf, bicep, tricep, forearm. Friday it was both hamstrings, and I eventually had horrible pleurisy with extreme shoulder pain. My rheumatologist wants me to start IV rituxan for severe Sjogrens. From what I've read, it's a powerful medication but has a good chance to get my immune system under control. Does anyone have any experience with this med?"
I just received my blood tests results:

"ANA: positive 1:80, homogeneous aspect."

p-ANCAS: positive 1:20

Anti-ENA panel: everything was negative

CRP: < 2.9 mg/L

"I have had ongoing, worsening dryness for about 2 years now...now I am at the point I use eye drop every 15 minutes during the day, I can't stand the sunlight, my vision is weird as hell, etc...my ophtalmologist was convinced I have Sjogren's, so he sent me to a specialist, who said ""you probably have it, along with another auto-immune illness""...but apparently the specific blood tests are normal. My mouth is also dry, my throat as well, I have chronic ear pain, dry skin, dry vagina, dry nose, nosebleeds, etc...which are all worsening. I can't even set the heat like I want to, or it worsens my dryness. I have to get up to drink and put eye drops in the night..."

I have gotten a beginning of eye ulcer three times. I don't take any meds that could cause dryness. I don't use a dehumidifier or anything.

"My lab says my ANA is positive, but it's a low titer as far as I understand."

Should I go through with the lip biopsy or is it pointless in my case? Any of you guys had negative antibodies but still had Sjogren's?
"How do you stop the pins and needles all over and in feet and legs, the feeling of itching, the pain in the knees?  This started 3 months ago and I only had the first symptom of anything in December 2017.  I am male and I can't go on with this."
https://youtu.be/rQasZtTKMAs

I have Ankylosing spondylitis.

"I've had extremely dry eyes (confirmed by oftamologist) for about one year, dry nose for maybe 2-3 years and now my throat is very dry especially in the morning. My rheumatologist have taken the Sjögren blood tests and it came back negative. Is it possible that I have it anyway? He said it's quite common to have as and Sjögren both. He also said that the fact that I'm allergic to sulfa drugs is also a sign of Sjögren."

Any thoughts on this? I have an appointment with my reumatologist next week and I'm a but nervous for what he'll say.

"I have dry eyes, a dry nose and a dry mouth. I'm hyper allergic to things like dust which be due to an overactive immune system. I have Leukoplakia inside my mouth (pics): [https://imgur.com/a/Ngj3UHJ](https://imgur.com/a/Ngj3UHJ)"

"Besides these symptoms, I don't have any joint pain (so idk if it makes sense to see a rheumatologist), fatigue or dry skin (some of the popular Sjogren symptoms)."

I did a blood test last year and everything came out perfect. I don't remember if standard blood tests test for so maybe I have the markers but they just didn't test for them:

* **ANAs**
* **SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La)**
* **ESR**

What type of doctor should I see?
"Hi, 32F with sjogren’s. My crown literally fell out tonight. A crown that I overpaid for 3 years ago with ridiculously expensive dental insurance. Can anyone shed any light on why someone like myself who bought a professional toothbrush and uses floss and regular use of oral healthcare products would experience this? It’s in one piece. Anyone have experience with it just being put back on?"
"Never got tested officially had gone to a crazy ton of doctors. Finally my 5th eye doctor connectsall the dots and says sjogrens. Told me not to worry that it was basically a precursor disease for something worse and just be aware. All that aside, just came from the dentist and I'll have dropped 5K (with insurance) and 3 root canals in less than two years. How does everybody afford their dental care is their extra stuff I need to be doing? Ready to just pull all my teeth and gee dentures."
"I am a 24 yo male , i am hitting the gym , non smoker occasionally  drinker ."

The only effect i have is a dry mouth specially in the mornings . I did a bunch of blood tests from my pathologist and everything came out to be good . I did blood results for sjorgen syndrome and other autoimmune deceases and all the results are fine . My ENT dr now want's me to do a lip biopsy to verify if i have sjorgen or not cause he says blood tests are not enough but im scared to death .

Any advice /help would be appreciated .
"Hi, everyone!"
"SO, I was diagnosed at 8 years old with SS after about a year having repeating parotiditis (about 9) and other things. I think the fact that I was diagnosed so early may be the reason why I now have some symptoms none of the older ladies I knew at the time had. The treatment when I was younger made me sun-sensitive, but other than that I was pretty much a ""normal"" child. But as I grew older I started getting more joint pain all over (seriously, sometimes my rib cage hurts), which put me on a path of corticosteroids and immunossupressors . Now I have severe fatigue, pains that sometimes hinder my capacity to go to work (or do anything, really) and now I'm starting to have some neurological problems too (concentration loss, my memory gets fuzzy and I can't even remember simple words that a 4 y/o would know, parestesia..). And, to top that, I've developed a reaction to my drugs so I can't take them anymore."

"Does anyone here deal with any of this? Can you give me some advice or help me in some way? I tend to try and be strong, go to my limits and, sometimes, beyond that so SS doesn't govern my life, but it's been hell lately and I don't now how to cope anymore."
"My eyes are getting more dry and irritated even with artificer tears.  Curious about anyone's use of Restasis, and if it was working for them.  Thanks."
"55yo male.  My mouth gets super-dry at night, and by morning, it is like a desert in my mouth.  I just battled oral thrush.  Started getting"
"real bad pain in my tongue, on the forward half.  It hurts to eat anything, but citrus/acidic is the worst.  My ENT said this can be due to dry mouth.  I am going to talk to my rheumatologist."
Has anyone ever been on any of these saliva prescription med?  What where the results?  Notice any of the side-effects?

Thanks!
"I've been seeing doctors for the last few months trying to figure out what's going on with me, and I'm starting to wonder if it may be Sjogren's. How were you all diagnosed? None of my doctors have mentioned Sjogren's at all, but I've been tested for RA, lupus, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Everything was negative (although there has been some confusion with my thyroid - it was underactive, now it's normal, and we're retesting next week)."

"I initially went to the doctor because I thought I had oral thrush - I had white patches, dry mouth, some minor itchiness. It turned out NOT to be oral thrush. To be honest I still don't know what it is - I'm going to a dental specialist on the 25th and will hopefully find out then. Nobody has been able to explain the dry mouth, though. I've been dealing with dry mouth for about a year now, sometimes better, sometimes worse (has been worse lately). I don't know if that is related to the white patches or not? An ENT and my dentist thought the white patches could be food related, possibly a new allergy, or somehow due to my fissured tongue. They couldn't explain the dry mouth. I was not taking antibiotics or anything else until recently (taking nortriptaline now, which might explain why it's been worse?). I have a dry cough sometimes as well, usually in the mornings."

"I've also been seeing my doctor because I've been experiencing fatigue for at least 7 months. It has improved over the last couple weeks for no apparent reason, which has been nice, but I'm worried it's going to come back, and I wish I had an answer for why I was experiencing it in the first place."

"I've also had mild joint pain in my hands for as long as I can remember. No swelling or redness or anything, just a dull sort of aching in my knuckles and sometimes wrist. I have had this since I was a child."

"I'm taking the nortriptaline for depression and my doctor said it may help with the fatigue, but I actually noticed that the fatigue had improved the day before I started taking it. So I don't know if it really is or not."

"I don't usually have dry eyes, though."

"Anyway, I'm just wondering about the diagnostic process. This is the only thing that seems to explain my dry mouth, fatigue, and joint issues, but I'm not a doctor or any sort of health professional so I really don't know. Will be speaking with my doctor very soon. Thanks for any input!"

"My dr upped my plaquenil to 400mg/day.  I get these flareups that last for days where my parotid glans throb and pulsate.  Ont super painful, but very uncomfortable - maybe 3 on a 1-10 pain scale."
"The wost time is at bedtime, when I try to go to sleep, the pain is much more noticeable.  Any suggestions please!  (this sucks)"

"Hi, 37yo male.  Finally getting around to seeing a rheumatologist tomorrow. I've had 2+ years of dry mouth, dry eyes (eyelids stuck shut every morning when I wake up), joint and muscle pain that just doesn't seem normal for me.  Also, not sure if it's related, but I have this odd swallowing issue that certain foods cause me to basically not be able to get it down all the way and I get hiccups and have to induce vomiting to alleviate the hiccups.  And finally, constipation and hemorrhoids.  I try to watch my fluids and fiber and I'm fairly active, but get recurrent bouts.  PCP ran some labs but nothing abnormal: negative ana, Rhfactor below threshold, low ESR."

It'll be interesting or uneventful to hear what he has to say tomorrow.
Has anyone tried this yet? My Dr is starting me on it and I was wondering if anyone has any good recipes or advice about it.
"I have not been diagnosed but I think it is something I need to look into. I have really dry eyes that causes really bad photo sensitivity. I’ve had this on and off my whole life but the last year has been awful. I use artificial tears after seeing an eye doctor and it only helps so much. I also have a dry mouth but it like the back of the mouth and have had more difficulty swallowing, especially dry foods like bread. I have kind of ignored this even though it is scary but I recently joked with my husband how weird it was that he could eat a meal without any drink. Me on the other hand, I HAVE to have water with all food. I usually drink 2-3 cups during a meal. I get a little panicy if I don’t. (I also have generalized anxiety so it’s just worse of course...). Anyways, I realized this constant need for water is apparently not normal. I also always have dry skin and sadly dry vagina :[. I just feel dry all over. So I want to see about getting tested for sjogren’s but I don’t know where to start. I just don’t know where to start by asking. Any advice? My anxiety tends to get in the way because I’ve been to docs before and always get told that whatever problem I’m dealing with is just anxiety. Kind of afraid to get shit down. I just want to know if this is the cause and that I’m not crazy. Any advice for a 23F with anxiety and a not so very assertive personality??? =\"
"A doctor suggested I try plaquenil but my mom freaked out about it. She’s a nurse at a university and has seen people taking it as an anti-malarial when going abroad have some bad side effects, so now I’m kind of afraid to try it. Has anyone experienced bad side effects from it? And how has it helped you, if at all?"
It’s nonstop these days. I used regular eye drops from the drug store to help but recently it just isn’t cutting it. Anyone have suggestions?
"I know many of you are tired and may be fatigued. However, I think it would be very helpful to get a sense of how the medicines you've taken have evolved over time so that future readers get a better sense of the disease's path. (i.e. most everyone starts with plaquenil+symptomatic therapy such as drops for example but quite a few go on to steroids, cellcept, azathioprine, rituxan, etc)."

For example:

1). Initially just plaquenil and symptomatic therapy for eyes.
----------All well for 1 years
"2). For flares, steroids at 60g."
---------All well for 2 months
3). Started cellcept along with tapering steroids course plus symptomatic therapy.

Cheers!


"Hi all,"

"I have a really dumb (in the grand scheme of things) question to ask. I went to my primary care doctor to get checked for an auto-immune disease and got a high ANA level, and a high level of Sjogrens antibodies in my blood. She couldn't diagnose me because she wasn't a specialist so I'm waiting for an appointment with a rheumatologist next month. Here's my dumb question - will I have to get a biopsy to be diagnosed? I have symptoms (very dry eyes, dry mouth, chronic fatigue, always getting sick), and the blood test, and I started looking up the biopsy stuff and it just freaks me out. I know the symptoms, and the presence of the disease itself are the bigger issues, but this is what I'm more worried about at the moment. So did anyone get diagnosed without having to get a biopsy? Or should I mentally prepare myself because that's the next step?"

Thanks!

Hi /r/Sjogrens

I've been lurking here for a while as my girlfriend has this condition for a couple of years. Apparently she is in remission however she is starting to have dry eyes that's impacting her daily life severely.

"She is an active lady who loves biking and all things outdoors. She recently rode a 20k fun ride and had to use swimming goggles (prescription) to keep her eyes from drying up. While it worked, it fogged up quickly so we're on a hunt for double-walled/anti-fog goggles."

Her current management method is the following:
1. Plaquenil (taking since April 2015 recommended by her rheum)
"2. Daily omega 3 supplements (about 2 weeks now, recommended by optometrist)"
3. Combination of Systane and Theratears preservative free drops (now taking 5-7 times daily)
"4. Lowered brightness and put on warmer colours on monitors, red light filter on phones"
5. Air humidifier in the bedroom

Dry eye symptoms seem to be getting worse but she found option #3 from you guys here which works really well for a limited time (thank YOU!).

Wanted to ask /r/Sjogrens for input on suggestions for further management. Thanks everyone!
Does anyone else have Sjogren's and premature ovarian failure?

I was told by my doctor yesterday that I have POF and that I may not be able to have children. I'll be 34 in November and got married in May. I'm devastated and trying to find my way through the haze.

"Has anyone else been in my situation and is it just downhill from here? I was told I am at risk of Addison's disease and since I already have lupus and fibromyalgia, I'm not sure how much more I can handle before I just run away screaming."

"Hello everyone,"

I just discovered this sub and I can already tell that I will be able to find a lot of information for my wife as well as tips for me to help her as a spouse. We just went to our first support group and met a wonderful group of people. My wife was diagnosed a few years back and pretty MAJOR dental problems. We just got a bill and she has the highest dental insurance coverage through her work that she could apply for but the bill is still quite large. Has anybody had any luck getting coverage through their medical insurance due to a Sjogren's diagnosis? My wife is a rockstar and it is hard to watch her struggle through this but we are ready to fight and get involved. Thank you in advance for any help or support you can offer.
"I had been clinging to trying to wear contacts because my vision is even worse with glasses and I hate wearing them, but the soft contacts were so damn uncomfortable and blurry and itchy that I couldn't wear them a full day and really only got an hour or 2 of comfortable wear. Eye doc recommended scleral lenses because they're rigid and formed such that they trap a layer of sterile saline between the contact and the eye rather than wicking away moisture like soft contacts. So I took the plunge. Thoughts:"

"Been wearing them for a few months now. I can usually go a full day wearing the scleral lenses (14 hrs is pushing it), but if not I can take out and ""reset"" with a new bubble of saline. They're much more comfortable and my vision is way more stable. I still get a lot of protein buildup on the lenses by the end of the day, but the cleaners they make for this seem to be doing the job ok."

"Cost wise, they were expensive - $700 for the pair, including astigmatism. Plus my doc's additional ""fitting"" appointment cost. As my prescription is stable, they should last me several years. My vision is bad, so my soft lenses were already custom and not super cheap - $80/3 months. After 2-3 years the scleral lenses become more cost effective for me, assuming I don't lose or break them."

Last thing to note is that my dry eye is probably moderate. I'm on restasis and use gel eye drops at night (probably switching to an ointment soon though) but I haven't needed to top off during the day because of the layer of saline the contacts trap against the eye.

Hopefully this was helpful for anyone else still hoping to use contacts.
Like the title says it am looking for ways to try and help my girlfriend who has sjogrens she was diagnosed a long time ago when we were still in high school. It isn't new but she has never really done anything with her diagnosis since and she is on the more extreme end severe joint pain is by far the hardest part for her. We've talked about it but she doesn't know what to do to try and help herself her parents basically just left her to figure it out. What have any of you done to help yourselves or someone else with sjogrens I need to do something for her most days she can barely walk by the end of the day and those are the good days.
"Has anyone had any personal experiences with reoccurring sublingual ranulas underneath tongue? This extremely odd phenomenon was what led me to my Sjorens diagnosis. I woke up one day with a flap under my tongue that just kept filling up more and more, until it was the size of a grape. The size fluctuated, drained, and refilled. This went on for almost a year. This, accompanied by extreme mouth and eye dryness, burning, some joint pain."

"I honestly can't take it anymore. I have had the ranula issue for 3 years now, and over five operations to treat it. I have been to oral surgeons, ENT's, rheumatologist's; you name it. The oral surgeons and ENT's have performed marsupialization and other probing procedures. It ALWAYS returns."
I visited my dermatologist on Wednesday and she suggested 2 units of botox under my nose for a droopy tip. I mentioned having pretty dry mouth and she said it wouldn't have any effect on it. Afterwards I become so dry that neither salagen or evoxac will do anything. I'm wondering how long this will last because at this point the dryness is unbearable and I just started a new job a month ago and am really struggling to work or do anything with the side effects. Any suggestions or if anyone has an idea on long 2 units will last would be appreciated.
"My nose is runny, I'm phlegmy, my mucous membranes of my nose and throat feel irritated and dry. I have a dry cough. The joys of waking up every morning feeling this way. Is this part of the fun of (potentially) having an autoimmune disease?"
"Has anybody any experience using a humidifier? My eyes, airways, skin, lips and throat are dry anyway, but they are *super* dry at this time of year because we need to have the heating on so much. I'm thinking a humidifier may provide a bit of relief. But I'm not sure! Does anybody have any experience using one?"
Long time lurker here.

"Early 20s female supposedly diagnosed with Sjogrens 4 years ago. I had several different Rheumatologists diagnose me, even though my blood work came back a little ambiguous. My main issue is joint pain. I was put on Plaquenil, and it seemed to help a little, but I still noticed things bothering me. I went off of it thinking it wasn't helping. The past 2 weeks, my joint pain has been the worst it's ever been. I limp when I walk, I can't sleep, and I find doing certain tasks wear me out fast. I'm so stiff after sitting and when I wake up. Should I go back on Plaquenil? Or do you think I could also have an underlying issue? I was tested for RA in the past and it was negative. I'm starting to think I don't have Sjogren's, even though I have so many common symptoms. Going to my Rheumatologist soon....what should I ask?"
I feel like my joints should not be giving me so much issue. Can Sjogren's be severe?
"For reference, I was diagnosed when I was 16, and I am currently 25."

"I used to just use a petroleum-based lip gloss (i.e. chapstick), but after a few years, I found my lips weren't quite being moisturized as much as I wanted. If anything, they'd be moisturized, and within a few hours I would feel my lips begin to crack again."

"Because of this I switched to glycerin-based lip glosses. The results have been a bit better, but again, I'm not completely satisfied. So far I've tried the Fresh Sugar Intense Lip Therapy, which is... ok; the winter season isn't helping. Everyone at Sephora recommends a lip scrub or exfoliation treatment, but I'm honestly not sure if that's the best given Sjogren's."

Has anyone had decent results with an exfoliation treatment? Or maybe they could offer some insight into a really good lip gloss?
"Hey,"

"I've been dealing with unusual neurological symptoms since I was 19. I'm 25 now. The first thing that happened was that I began to struggle with erectile dysfunction... weird for such a young age. Then I started to notice a change in my urination habits. I was either urinating too frequently or not enough, depending on the day. Urologist said the issue was a pelvic floor dysfunction."

"Soon after I started to get tingly numbness in my thighs and later lost all feeling in my big toes. I was diagnosed with long-fiber peripheral neuropathy and had multiple neurologists clear me for MS and tell me ""as long as it's not painful, it's no big deal."" I've had neuropathy symptoms for three years now and believe that my bladder problems are a combination of that and stress/anxiety."

"Eventually I sought a second opinion from a neurologist who decided to test for autoimmune involvement. All blood tests came back negative: negative ANA, normal sed rate, no RF... *except* I apparently have a very small number of anti-SSA antibodies. Doc said this was really weird to have them and no other abnormal bloodwork. The way the measurement worked for these labs, over 40 meant positive for anti-SSA, and my value was 49. He said that was positive for sure, but that people with Sjogrens would have more like 100 on that scale. But googling ""anti-SSA"" seems to indicate that if you have the antibodies at all, you 100% have or will have a disease, so I'm freaking out."

"Also, I'm having flashbacks to three years ago when my urologist noted trace protein in my urine but said it was probably nothing. Could this be some weird autoimmune disorder attacking only my kidneys and nerves in my feet? My most recent urinalysis also had trace protein but that was considered normal and my BUN was normal."

"I just don't understand, as an ANA-negative, 25-year-old male with no symptoms except for a very mild and non-painful neuropathy where that leaves me. I am now seeing a rhuematologist and am awaiting answers, but as someone who has had intense, crippling hypochondria and health anxiety since childhood, being in such a weird, rare position to develop a horrible chronic illness seems a cruel twist of fate."
Thank you all in advance for your time reading this! I am new to this sub but it seems to be a very nourturing environment :)

On to my problems:
"I have been seeing various eye doctors and opticians for the last five years (am now 26). I need eye drops about 20-30 times a day, depending on activity, how well I slept,etc.. This eventually led to a lip biopsy, which came back positive. My first reumatologist meeting is next week, what are some good points to bring up? I don't want to seem too needy or overdramatic, but I do want this to be taken seriously."

"I've been told to ask about B12 deficiency, and pilocarpine hydrochloride. Anything else that would be good to bring up?"

Any advice would be much appreciated!! (I admit I am freaking out a little bit)
"I've (F60) had dry eye for about 8 yrs now, the last one using restasis and just recently avenova, also fish oil for about 5-6 yrs.  It's not awful, but gradually getting a little worse, and it definitely is inflamed interfering with vision."

"I've also had dry mouth for several years.  It may be related to using a CPAP, but I do use an attached humidifier.  Still sometimes it gets so dry at night I have to peel my lips off my teeth using my fingers, and it gets dry way down my throat, past the tonsils.  During the day it's not too bad if I stay hydrated.  I use biotene paste and mouthwash per dentist.  Dentist has noticed I'm getting a lot of small cavities despite going in for cleanings every 4 months."

"I am also diabetic about 8 yrs., on bydureon, invokana and metformin.  Simvistatin for preventive cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid (also about 10 yrs.)"

"I am getting a tiny bit of neuropathy in my feet (assumed it was diabetes).  I've also noticed big dry skin patches on my upper legs and torso that have gotten both larger and drier in the last couple of years, but I wrote that off to the diabetes as well."

"Over the last six months I started getting an on-again, off-again muscle pain on the shoulder.  Endo tested vit D and found it extremely low, put me on 50,000 units weekly until it got back into the normal range, now it's monthly.  The arm muscle pain became less frequent and less intense after than (so I wrote that off to vitamin deficiency)."

"I have no gastro issues (yay!) and no flu-ish issues, although I do feel kind of run-down and tired (wrote that off to stress, laziness/lack of exercise)."

"None of the doctors are talking to each other, so no one's put a picture together.  I have no single primary--instead, the Endo, dentist, and opthamologist."

I came across a post the other day elsewhere and started researching sjogren's when it had a much closer fit than I expected.

"I'm now second-guessing everything, and wondering if this could be a fit for early presentation of SS?    So many people seem to have trouble with getting diagnosed, and I really am not having issues that aren't already being treated, so I'm wondering if I'm just over-reacting.  There is Sjogren's clinic in my city, should I go there and get evaluated, or have I just gone off the hypochondriac deep end?"
I have been reading through the forum and it seems a lot of people are diagnosed but tested negative for anti bodies? How is that possible? How did they determine the diagnosis otherwise?

"28/F, primary SS, possible lupus"

"My biggest issue with SS is chronic pain, especially in my hips, feet and shoulders. I don't want to take narcotics for obvious reasons, and don't want prednisone/plaquenil/etc long term due to the side effects, which set in after a couple days of steroids."

"Anyone else have pain issues? How do you treat them without drugs? Yoga helps and I walk a lot, staying fairly active. I'm kind of despairing though because activity is getting more painful. Chiropractor and acupuncturist provided super short term relief but when it comes back, the pain gets worse. Anyone have a suggestion? Supplements? Herbal remedies? Putting mashed potatoes in my pockets while performing ritual dances? I am willing to try anything. I don't have it in me to feel this shitty this often."
Just something to keep in mind.  I haven't been tested but going gf eliminated like 90% of my symptoms. Hope this helps someone.

"Hello all,"

I have been interested in this forum for some time now and wanted to share my experience and get your thoughts on what my concerns could be.

Gender: Male
Age :21
Ethnicity: Indian (SE Asian)
Smoking: No

Back in December (about 3 months ago) I had an episode of extreme dry mouth that lasted about 10 days.
"The onset was about 2 days of feeling as though my mouth was drying out, not necessarily gradual worsening, then bam out of nowhere - almost complete inability to produce saliva."
"On many of those 10 days I was unable to produce any saliva which dried out my throat and made it painful to sleep/swallow, I could not produce enough to eat, had drying lips, etc.,"

"It was dry mouth with no other symptoms - markedly, I did not feel dry eyes."

"I saw two dentists, both who said that there was a small amount of saliva production when stimulated despite dryness and no swelling of the glands so that I should just wait it out."
I saw a physician who said it could be lingering effects of stress/viral infection and that I should increase my water intake and wait it out.
A few days later I was fine but I had developed a possibly unrelated jaw pain that I thought may have been TMJ but subsided.
"That subsided in two weeks and then I was ""back to normal"", as far as I could tell."

Tuesday of last week I saw the symptoms come back when I thought they had gone away.
The symptoms weren't as severe as last time until suddenly last night it began to worsen.
Now I'm wondering if it was simply a much longer time of onset...

Reasons I believe I could have Sjorgen's

Dry mouth symptoms
Possible involvement of dry nose
Immediate blood relative has auto immune disorder - sister has Vitiligo
Could have been predicated by topical immiquimod disease
Insidious nature of disease may mean these are just early warnings
Others have shown that the symptoms can come and go and are highly personalized so fact that I don't have dry eyes may mean nothing


Reasons I could not have Sjorgen's

"• Lot of other reasons, supposedly, that are bengin and better explain dry mouth only conditions"

• Any suspicions of nasal symptoms or ocular symptoms are likely just confirmation bias

"• Not likely to have based upon typical age group, gender, or ethnicity"

• No inflammation of glands; does not improve with NSAID use and not palpable

• No ocular involvement

"• Seems like it should be chronic, my symptoms are both acute and intermittent"

• Could be due to seasonal changes

I have a lingering suspicion that this may all just be related to my impacted wisdom teeth but that's perhaps more hopeful than anything.


Let me know what you guys think.

"I'm currently looking for a job because we need the extra income(under the table). I am currently waiting on a hearing date to receive ssi. But there's no telling when I will get a date. I'm Dreading It Because I Have No Idea How I'm Supposed To Keep A job When I'm Going To Need time Off constantly for All the Doctor Appointments I have and constantly feeling sick. I have a mandatory every 3 month appointment with a rheumatologist and immunologist.  Plus upcoming appointments with a neurologist, orthopedic surgeon and 4 other specialist. I don't want to be fired after a few months because I've taken so many days off or come in late. Thats not Something An Employer Is Going To wantm"
"Hi, I've had SS for about 3 years now and the one thing that I have struggled with the most is finding a toothpaste that won't irritate my mouth. So my question is, do any other SS sufferers find that after you brush your teeth, the skin inside your mouth starts to peal? It is something that really affects me now and I can no longer brush my teeth at night as I end up feeling sick from the skin going down my throat. I have gotten around this by just flossing and using mouth wash at night followed by a rinse of coconut oil, but toothpaste in general does irritate me and makes my mouth much dryer. Does anyone else get this and is there any suggestions to help it? I've heard about aloe vera toothpaste - would this be worth investing in? I've tried so many different toothpastes already that I'm running out of options from regular shops."

"Going for this next week (starting the course of four treatments), apparently it has great results for dry eyes. Would be awesome to get rid och my eye ticks and maybe even wear contacts again!"
Hi there - I have MS and Graves and over the last few years I have been starting a whole bunch of new and exciting (sarcasm) symptoms.

"I have had multiple weird symptoms all my life, which after the MS diagnosis in 2000 I put down to MS. Then came the Graves diagnosis 4 years alter. So I will not be surprised if I win the jackpot of another auto-immune disease. I have just had my Thyroid tests redone to see if the Graves was flaring, but they are mostly within normal range."

"Anyway a lot of my fun new symptoms point to Sjorgren's but one of the defining disease markers is dry eyes. My eyes, while scratchy, painful and hard to focus are running like taps for most of the day. In the morning they are gummy, with crud in the lashes as well (my normal morning eye crud was just on the inner corner). The eyes feel gummy all day, even after washing them in the morning. If I lay down water leaks out of the corners."

"Des this sound familiar to anyone? I tried searching for runny eyes, teary eyes and gummy eyes and nothing came up...."
How have people symptoms been during pregnant? Anything worsen or get better?

"Does anyone experience excruciating jaw pain. I have Lupus SLE and have been diagnosed for 18+ years.  Recently, within the past two years, I have also been diagnosed with Sjogrens."

"I like to think I have a high pain tolerance but, this jaw pain is almost more than I can handle. I tried relaxing my jaw and also tightening it. Nothing relieved the pain.  Has this ever occurred to anyone else? If so, how did you make it stop?"
"When I went to fill my last scrip, they charged me $123 and I've stopped taking it because I can't afford it. I have read there is a shortage which has driven up prices. Is there something else I could take in the meantime? I'm afraid to tell my Dr. because she'll just say I have to take it."
"I might have Sjogrens.  As you know, getting a diagnosis can be tricky and take a while."

I read stories online from people who have it and I start to freak out because some of these stories are pretty bad and I'm only 30 with a long life in front of me and this wasn't in my plans.

I recognize that the following question is similar to asking everyone who is not in the room to raise their hand - but humour me.

"I'd like to think that there is a bias in the online forums - people who are managing well are out and about living their lives - and people who are having some troubles are going online to forums to look for some help.  As a result, the prognosis can look worse than it is if you rely on anecdotal evidence on the forums."

Is there any truth to that?



"Does anyone experience any problems with vaginal drying and tearing? It is especially painful during intercourse, I use lube and Lidocaine. Does anyone else experience similar problems?"

pSS sufferer. I know all people should seek a course of therapy from a qualified physician. I am not suggesting we do otherwise.
"However, what has, in your search for relief, been a true help to you and which symptoms did it help with?"
"For me, I always use a humidifier in whatever room I am in. I like to have a lot of eyedrops handy and I'm a big fan of overnight eye moisturizer in tiny tubes. There are a few different brands but they all have the same basic ingredient."
I also find that high pH water is very soothing to my mouth. I like 9 pH to 10 pH.
I was just diagnosed this year. They caught it at a very early stage so I'm not on any prescription meds (just supplements and tylenol every day).

"The joint pain is pretty horrible some evenings. My job has me on and off my feet and up and down stairs quite a bit. Before my dx I saw a physical therapist who said I have loose joints. So, my husband (and I) were wondering if knee braces would help with the pain by reducing inflammation-causing irritation when I'm active at work or exercising at home. Any thoughts or suggestions?"

"I've been seeing a rheumatologist for the last year and a half for pain and fatigue and general blahness.  I had blurry, mildly dry eyes at my October appointment so she tested me for Sjogren's and my results came back normal (like all my others too, sigh)."

"In the last month my eyes have become increasingly blurry and dry, and now red and occasionally itchy, and I'm extremely sensitive to light now.  I drive a forklift and the wind from that makes it tough to drive (Plus I drive inside the cooler... cold, dry wind, yay!)."

"Just in the last two weeks I've realized my mouth has become dry.  I wake up with cotton mouth and have to drink lots during the day To keep it from feeling gross.  I noticed last week my tooth enamel is wearing off, when I had my first mouth ulcer.  Joy."

"I've also been struggling with a low-self-lubricating vagina for more than 5 years, but also in the last couple weeks I feel on the brink of a yeast infection."

And my skin all over is just soooo dryyyyy no matter how much I drink and moisturize.  It's like I just don't absorb any of the water I drink.

"I had my doctor test my thyroid this week to make sure it wasn't just that and that came back normal as well (although when I looked at my results I noticed he didn't test properly according to /r/hypothyroidism).  But still, Im just feeling like I probably have Sjogren's."

"I plan to read the faq for the more obvious questions, but my other questions are!:  Will they retest me so soon after the negative result?  Is constipation/regular hard poop related to Sjogren's at all?  When I talk for too long, I get a painful lump in my throat - is that related as well?  And last, what in the world can you do for dry mouth overnight?! (Edit for one more!  Does anyone else get crazy muscle fatigue really easily?  I'll sometimes feel the burning in my muscles like I'm dehydrated after a marathon, just from like, vacuuming!  What the heck?)"
"I'm still in the process of getting a specific diagnosis, although my lab work came up positive for Sjogren's SS-B. That lab work was ordered probably a month or a month and a half ago. I didn't have lymph swelling at the time, but shortly after, began noticing pain and swelling under my cheekbones and jawIine, which has not gone away and actually seems to be more pronounced. I just accidentally bumped the area near my collarbone and realized it was very tender, so I sort of felt around and realized the tenderness continued into my armpit, where there was also swelling, and around and under my breast as well. I'm sort of freaking out at the moment, as I'm not sure what can be attributed to Sjogren's and what i should actually be worried about. I'm supposed to get more lab work asap, as well as a chest X-ray. Would swollen lymph nodes affect either of those? I'm kind of curious as to whether I should hurry and do them while this is going on, in case it stops, or if I really should wait until it's better?"
"I just got back my lab results online from yesterday, but I still have to wait until Thursday to speak to my doctor about what everything means. I've been nonstop Googling and panicking since, hah."
"I had a viral profile done because of chronic fatigue and a skin rash that won't go away. The results seem to indicate that I have some type of Epstein Barr Virus, as well as Sjogren's, which I'd never even heard of until now. I Googled it and I feel like it doesn't even really encompass my weird, mystery symptoms--my eyes and mouth feel normal, as far as I can tell. Can someone make sense of these results/give me an idea of what they mean so that I can prepare to speak to my doctor? I'm losing my mind waiting! Also, what have your experiences/symptoms been with it?"

"Hey guys. I went to the rheumatologist yesterday and got a Sjogren's diagnosis, Raynaud's Phenomenon and a tentative subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus diagnosis. On one hand I'm relieved to get some answers, but I'm a little lost as to where to go next. He put me on blood pressure medication for the Raynauds. I'm a little overwhelmed, I was treated for salivary gland cancer this year, and now this. I have been gluten free for over a year now because when I eat gluten I get pain throughout my body, but the doc says it's unrelated to these conditions. So, just kind of wondering what tips and tricks you guys have. Questions I should be asking. I've been doing a little googling but there's a lot of info out there. I know you guys can't give medical advice but I'm feeling a little lost and eager to hear your advice on managing these conditions. Thanks for reading."

"I haven't seen it suggested specifically for Sjogren's but thought I might give it a try in addition to my regular oral care. [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/oil-pulling) suggests it can be useful. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling) also says it can be effective, but ""Ayurvedic experts warn of negative side effects - if improper technique is used - such as dry mouth, excessive thirst, muscular stiffness, exhaustion and loss of sensation or taste in the mouth."" Heh. Since I already have dry mouth, excessive thirst, muscular stiffness, and fatigue, I'm not sure how I'd know if I was experiencing negative results."

"I had some coconut oil and figured I'd start small, like 5 minutes. As others had described, it wasn't exactly pleasant while I waited for it to melt in my mouth, but the swishing part wasn't bad at all. Soothing, even. I figure I'll try it for a while and see how it goes. Maybe it'll be like the [Neti Nasal Rinse](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=142205&catid=59915&aid=338666&aparam=142205&kpid=142205&CAWELAID=120142990000072055&CAGPSPN=pla&kpid=142205) in that once I got used to the ""weirdness"" of the practice, I really appreciated the benefits."

"Anyway, if there's any interest, I'll let you know how it goes if I stick with it. Do you use oil pulling?"

"Because my immune system is in constant overdrive, I've had shingles several times in the last 2 years.  My doctor and I discussed the shingles vaccine but are both worried it could trigger another attack, possibly more severe than I've had already, since it's made of live virus."

"Even if it were for the pain alone, I'd hope to never experience shingles again, but it's also embarrassing to have a blistery rash across my face (though I had it on my torso as well) and every time I have to avoid contact with most of my family who are grown but have never had chicken pox and even avoid contact with our 5 children who have been vaccinated for chicken pox but their pediatrician says they can still get it from me (it would just hopefully be milder and shorter lived)."

Has anyone who experienced a repeat attack had the vaccine and did it cause any complications??

Just got diagnosed with Sjogrens and wondered what should I expect illness wise? I have RA in both knees and Lupus but Dr said the symptoms are varied for this.

"What are the symptoms of Sjögren’s? –The typical symptoms associated with Sjögren’s are dry mouth and dry eyes. This can vary from slightly dry to significantly dry. Less commonly known symptoms of Sjögren’s are anemia, dental decay, joint and muscle pain, prolonged dry skin, skin rashes on the extremities, chronic dry cough, vaginal dryness, numbness or tingling in the extremities, and prolonged fatigue that interferes with daily life."

"Why is it called Sjogren’s? In 1930, Henrik Sjögren (1899-1986), an ophthalmologist in Jönköping, Sweden, observed a patient with low secretions from the lacrimal (which produce tears) and salivary (which produce saliva) glands. Sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca to describe the symptom of dry eyes (Keratoconjunctivitis). In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis, describing 19 females, most of whom were postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. Sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 50 of whom also had arthritis. His subsequent follow-up conference trips pertaining to his paper led to an international interest in Sjogren’s syndrome.  [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sj%C3%B6gren's_syndrome#History)"

My apologies in advance to those who suffer the myriad of symptoms associated with this disease. I am a 35 year old male witha diagnosis of primary disease as the result of a positive ssb titer. I am completely asymptomatic save some lacrimal gland swelling. No sicca symptoms.  My question is more about the potential progressive nature of the disease. Did anyone start asymptomatic and progress to more serious symptoms?  Thanks in advance and I am glad this place exists.
"I have felt mild symptoms of Sjogren's my whole life, but it wasn't until after I had a very severe case of mono that my symptoms became practically unbearable. Some doctors believe viral infection can trigger Sjogren's in predisposed individuals. Thoughts?"

What's going on with you? How are you doing?




* I'm sorry I haven't been as active just lately. I've been sicker than I'd like to admit the last weeks.
"First off, is anyone here? Seems kind of quiet around here...anyway...hope someone is lurking :)"

"I have my first rheumy appt tomorrow morning. My blood work from my primary doc showed positive ANA, SSA and CRP. My symptoms have been extreme thirst, dry eyes, vaginal dryness and now what seems to be increasing joint pain in my hips, knees and now elbows. Oh and some fatigue has been setting in. I also have IC and gluten issues. So a couple of questions:"

1.I just wanted to know if there are some important questions I shouldn't forget to ask? I wrote out a bunch of stuff but this is new to me and I'd like to get some feedback from people who have already gone through this.
2. How much is needed for a diagnosis? Do I need MORE tests done?
3. What should I expect at a first visit?

Thanks in advance for the help!

"Sometimes well-meaning, and not so well-meaning, friends give unsolicited advice on how to cure all your ails.  What's the silliest or weirdest piece of advice you have been given?"
I realize that there isn't much of an online community for those with Sjogren's.  New information on the disease is hard to come by.  It's great to see us all coming together to help one another.  I think we're seeing the beginning of something great.
"How long did it take you, or your loved one, to get diagnosed?"


"I'm chomping at the bit...I'm about to move to another state and it would be really nice to get the test results before I move, so I can get some guidance from my current rheum (already have new rheum lined up in state I'm moving to)."

"If my test results are positive, will I still have to get the lip biopsy? Or is the lip biopsy only done when the test results are negative but the patient has Sjogren's-like symptoms?"

"Last question - My rheum wants me to start Plaquenil, even though my lupus test came back negative and we still haven't gotten my results for the Sjogren's tests. Is that odd, that he's suggesting Plaquenil even though he hasn't pinned down a specific diagnosis?"

Thanks for your help on this!  :-)
"For the ladies, do you have any issues with birth control and sjogrens?"

"I was at the doctor on Friday. Briefly mentioning that I have a very dry mouth and  must get up several times every night to drink, I asked if this could be caused by some medications I used to take some years ago, which had that as a side effect. Doc said no, that they would not have that effect years after I stopped taking them, and that the only disease she knew that could cause this was Sjogren's, but that she did not think I have any other symptoms. We go through common symptoms and I also have dry eyes (I am constantly having pain in my right eye, she told me maybe a year ago that this is due to dryness), I have a dry and sore throat; I don't think I have joint pain, but I do have other bodily pain, e.g. chronic shoulder pain and tendonitis, have issues related to digestion. Blood tests have recently shown some changes related to my lungs and white blood cells (if I understand the latter correctly). The worst thing though is none of the above, but that I feel so tired, both physically and mentally. Googling for symptoms in the past, Sjogren's did come up a few times, but I don't think I really wanted to seriously entertain the thought. Now, however, I am quite sure I have it."


"Was working on my MSc thesis, about 5 years ago, when I remember things changing (I am now in my mid-thirties). I didn't notice any dryness in my mouth, as I was on those medications that already gave this as a side effect, I just remember going from being healthy and active to becoming very tired. Had been tired and depressed before, so my strategy was to take it easy for a while, until my energy levels would become normal again, but it's like they just never did. While waiting for things to change I became seriously delayed with my thesis, in the end I just had to force myself to get it done, it was a daily struggle. Since then I have been working as a PhD candidate for a few years, it has been hard. I don't have the drive and motivation I used to have, I can't really work for 8 hours anymore (because of the flexibility of my position I have tried to work less on weekdays, but also work on Sunday's). It's like there are not enough hours in the day (even though I mostly just work, make dinner and walk my dog). I used to run 5-6 times a week before I started to change (feel sick), and have recently started again (progressing very slowly since I have chronic tendonitis). While I do feel better about myself and my body, I found myself frequently Googling if it is normal to feel so tired after exercise. Usually I come home feeling good, but wanting to go to sleep."


"I have to switch jobs soon, have been dreading working a 9 to 5 job, and now I will also need to spend some time finishing my PhD on my free time. Want it to work out, but I am anxious about the future (e.g., can I complete my PhD, will I be on sick leave a lot, will I end up on partial disability?).  I own a house with my partner who is a student, so I need to work full time. Ideally I'd like to run my own company so I can have more flexible working hours (I have been thinking about this for the past year), but I don't think it will be possible for at least a few years."

"I know I need to go through the tests and get an official diagnosis, so I guess that's what's next. Of course I can not be 100 % certain that I have Sjogren's, but I feel quite certain. I don't know how long it will take for me to get a diagnosis, but probably some time (the public health care system in my county is not known for its efficiency). Being tired and under a lot of pressure had left me with a negative outlook on life. I had recently started to feel better, but it is now hard to accept that I could be chronically ill. Will do my best not to overthink this while I am still waiting to be diagnosed. Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading. Any feedback is also appreciated."
**Hey there. 35 male here.**

"My story begins beginning of this year when I got my first hordeloum/stye in one of my eyelids. Whole eyelid swollen, red, looking really bad. Treated it with the help of doctors and eventually all was well."

"Or so I thought... I have now had about 10 of those acute inflammations this year in total. Both eyes, both upper and lower eyelids. I've been running to doctors and been diagnosed with Blepharitis and meibom gland dysfunction. One mentioned I might have Ocular rosacea."

"About 6 months in I noticed my eyes were extremely dry at times, constantly having to blink and eye drops not helping much. I've now been doing daily warm compress, massage and cleaning with a saline solution on my eyelids. I'm now also at the end of my 2 month doxycycline antibiotic treatment."

"Recently, my eyes got so dry I have to wear an eye shield most of the day. I fear I'm not really getting better with this condition despite all my efforts."

"**This is not the first time I have problems with dry eyes, and to list my history:**"

* Eyes been dry before in periods
"* Now blepharitis, meibom gland dysfunction and possibly ocular rosacea"
* Diagnosed with Asthma (I believe this started after lung chlamydia. I've also had Mononucleosis). Symptoms started 10 years ago after a really bad lung infection. I'm still not sure it is Asthma but asthma medication is helping. One doctor said it was a type of asthma affecting small airways.
"* I suffer from fatigue and pronounced burning feeling in my lungs after straining myself physically (During if I push hard but also 1-2 days after the strain), feel it is linked to my lung condition and always wondered since it doesn't seem like normal asthma."
"* Also periods of having swollen parotid glands, also felt strongly this is linked to my lung condition. Haven't had this in a long time now though."
* Recent years I have felt like almost getting a panic attack from looking at the light from the sun (Not straight at it but just being outside when sun is shining bright).
"* Had many teeth cavities, even though I brush and floss morning and evening it still seems like it might not be enough."
"* I seem to be getting oral thrush every now and then (Whitish layer, throat, tongue and generally inside the mouth.)"
* Hands get some type of rash during winter
* Skin is sensitive to sun and seems to become easily red and spotty
* Bread causes lots of air in my digestive system and generally feels like I should not eat it.

**Family:**

* My brother has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and hla-b27 antigen.
* Been suspected my mother has rheumatoid arthritis as well.
* Father does not have rheumatoid arthritis but knows it has been present on his side of the family too.

**Recently had some blood tests done:**

* ANA: 1:320 and speckled (Positive it seems?)
* Rheumatoid factor: <8.4 (Not positive?)
* ENA: 0.2 (Apparently normal)
"* SSa, SSb negative (If I read my results correctly due to ENA being normal these are automatically also seen as negative?)"

**What changed in my life before these eye problems started:**

* 4 months before all this started I moved to another apartment. I was also under a lot of stress during this time.
* 2-3 months before all this started I also changed my lung medication to Innovair: [https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html](https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html) [https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler](https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler)
* Got a new bed

**Questions:**

* What are your thoughts? Any input or advice on what to do next is appreciated!
* Have you had problems with eyelids getting hordeloums/styes seemingly out of nowhere?
"How long does it take for the lip biopsy results to come back? I had mine done fairly recently, and I'm kind of impatient to know! Also, is it normal that a white patch forms as the stitches dissolve? (it doesn't look infected, and I've been using chlorhexidine mouthwash anyway)"
For a few months now my ankle has been swelling seemingly randomly. It began infrequently but has been happening more and more. I've kept a journal and can't spot any patterns. Now it seems to also be in the top of my foot.

I've tried googling but I just get tonnes of terrifying stuff!

"For info - I'm 5""9 and about 11stone. So, slightly high weight but not far into the overweight BMI category. Also I am a teacher so I am really active, always get my 10,000+ steps a day."

Has anyone experienced this or is there anyone who can shed some light?
"Hi, folks."
"Can ANA, SS-A & SS-B numbers return to normal (=negative)?  I've read that viral infections can give positive ANA numbers for a short time, so it seems like returning to normal would be a possibility."
So long story short I began having joint pain in March and fast forward to this week I finally met with a rheumalogist and based on my blood work (super high SSA) and the symptoms I've developed were fairly certain it's early sjogren's. I've been put on hydroxychloroquine and was wondering what you guys thought of it and how much it helps and how long it was before you really noticed a difference.
My wife has been using the clear eyes pure non preservative eye drops but they were pulled from Wally. Amazon has them but they are 14+ dollars a bottle. Has anyone found any others that seem to work as we are looking for something else in case amazon shipment is late or also becomes discontinued.
Does anyone know anything about what Medicare covers for dental??  I have some serious dental issues and have been told that I need some implants.

Has anyone tried and had good results with the AIP diet and any tips they would like to share.  I have been trying to battle my Sjogrens with nutritious green smoothies and lots of fresh veggies and antiinflammatory fruits and have been reading about the autoimmune paleo diet and am curious on what others experience with it may have been.  I am on year 3 with this disease and am not one that likes to take pills although I do take my plaquenil and cevelimine but worry about the adverse effects.
"Hi Everyone: I'm in the process of ruling out Sjogrens with my family doctor. My symptoms include dry mouth (10 superficial and gumline cavities since last summer), tinnitis and some neurological issues (numbness in hands).

"Anyone diagnosed with cataracts from Sjogrens? I'm only 54, and I am in the beginning stages of them. I already cannot drive at night. I say ""early"" because I thought cataracts were something people got in their 70s! Please share your experiences."
"I've been trying to track down symptoms for the last several years with a variety of specialists: Neurologist, ENT, and most recently, a rheumatologist. Started with numb lips, thigh, and ball of foot. Over the last 6 months or so, numbness developing in left foot, my parotids started swelling, and just feeling overall fatigue, working all week and then sleeping 14 hours on weekends. Within the last month, my mouth has become bone-dry; eyes not so bad but somewhat dry. // Edit: Eyelids also extremely puffy in the morning. //"

"All bloodwork normal so far besides an indicator early on for lupus. A recent visit to my rheumatologist and complaining of dry mouth prompted him to test me further for Sjogrens. More bloodwork, a scan of my parotids, and a lip biopsy are next. Joining here to exchange knowledge! Does anyone get the chills, especially in the morning?"
Anyone suffer from ss indigestion? And any tips to make it go away?
Having a flare and now this on top... ahhh sjogrens life :/
I've found some success with using warm compresses to help relieve salivary gland blockage. I'm wondering about the merits of doing regular compressing.

"In the mornings, I usually have mild difficulty clearing my glands, as some thick mucus tends to back up in the gland, since my mouth is dry all night. I'm thinking it might be a good idea to try a warm compress every morning, instead of massaging it and further irritating the gland. Has anyone here done anything similar?"
Everything started with swollen lymph nodes but mainly in my armpits. With blood work everything is fine with red blood cell and white blood cell count the only thing off is present ANA and Sjogrens anti-bodies. As i've stated in a post before my Rheumatologist has me on Hydroxychloroquine for 3 months to see if anything changes. I do get  dry eyes and dry mouth sometimes but not severely. MY main concern are my lymph nodes in my armpit. Does any one else here have this issue? It worries me because everything else in my blood seems fine and I've even had an ultrasound done on them but they're definitely present and add to my anxiety.
"Hey friends, I'm not officially diagnosed but have"
"very high antibodies for it (waiting for rheum app). Anyway, my eyes and mouth are beyond dry and it's been getting a lot worse. On top of this I seem to be getting painful bumps on my lash line, they last 4-5 days before leaving. Do any of you experience anything like this?"

Thanks!
"About a year ago I saw a Rheumatologist hoping for a Sjorgrens diagnosis to finally get help with my dry eyes, dry mouth, and thirst.  Blood testing came back negative so he sent me to an Endocrinologist to see if I might have Diabetes Insipidus; that was also negative.  I'm getting desperate to find some relief so I want to be tested again."
Question: Is a Rheumatologist the best specialist to get to a diagnosis; at least as the first step?

"Also, if I do get a positive diagnosis; are any medications known to best address the dry mouth and dry eyes symptoms?  I am getting very confused while reading about various meds; seems like Plaquenil is a go-to, but I also see a lot about newer Biologics.  I'd like to go into this with some knowledge what the doc may or may not be recommending.  When I last saw the doctor I asked if I could do a short run of some medication to see if helped my symptoms and he gave me a solid ""no"" to that due side affects and such... I seem to recall him basing that on steroid type medications, but could be wrong."
"Q: Has anyone ever ""tested"" medication without a diagnosis and can recommend something for me to suggest to the doctor?"
Would love to hear from anyone who's tried it. Thanks!
Hello :)

&#x200B;

I have to undergo a lip biopsy because of several symptoms and positive ANAs.

&#x200B;

"I wonder how accurate the results of the biopsy are. Can they come back normal, even if I have Sjogren's?"

"And is the result more likely to be abnormal/pathologic when someone expercience dryness of the mouth? I don't really have issues with a dry mouth, more with a dry throat. Could the biopsy still be abnormal or is it unlikely because of the ""nearly normal"" function of my salivary glands?"

&#x200B;

"The ANAs are 640 (speckled), I'm 22/F. Is there still any possibility I don't have a related disease or is the result too high to be ""positive without a reason""? Do they mean that I definitively have a disease?"

&#x200B;

Thank you.

&#x200B;

"Update three months later: I've been diagnosed with Sjogren's. The result of the biopsy was pretty clear (even without a dry mouth) and there are no doubts anymore with that result, my symptoms and the ANAs in combination."

"I’ve been having a lot of difficulty breathing, CT showed lung nodules, biopsy showed inflammation with elevated lymphocytes (similar to how the salivary gland biopsy showed). He is unsure if this is Sjogrens or another autoimmune disorder. My rheumatology appointment is tomorrow. Has anyone else gone through this? Was it just Sjogrens? ANAs etc have been negative (as were Sjogrens antibodies, I needed the lip biopsy to confirm diagnosis)."
Recently diagnosed after my parotid glands remained swollen for a couple of months. The doctor put me on a 20mg dose of prednisolone for 2 weeks. The swelling went down significantly but I feel it's growing again after I stopped. I still feel small lumps in my cheek and under my ear (lymph nodes?). He put me on another 10mg dose for 2 weeks. I also take Plaquenil but I don't think it does anything.

Any similar experiences?
"Last time I asked people said Neutrogena fast absorbing Swiss formula, but sadly they recently stopped making it. Which one do you guys use now?"

My blood tests all came back normal.  I have an aunt and female cousin on my father's side who have been diagnosed with Sjogren's.  Both of them had normal bloodwork and were confirmed with the lip biopsy.  My rheumatologist just told me I do NOT have Sjogren's after first visit based on my labwork and said that I just have dry eyes/rosacea. I'm not sure I am convinced given my other symptoms. Could anyone give their opinion? I don't want to keep pushing and seeing other specialists (which costs more money, those blood tests were expensive!) if I'm going down the wrong path."

"Has anyone experienced itching while taking Plaquenil? I’ve been taking it for just over a month and last week starting having spots all over my body that itch like crazy!

"A number of years ago I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, Lupus and RA.  Plaquenil, along with other meds, has been very effective in managing flare-ups.  However, the overwhelming dryness from Sjogren's has been the hardest to live with and my nails are a wreck.  Does anyone else struggle with dry, brittle nails?  Nail ridges?  I keep them short and have tried numerous nail treatments, cuticle creams, oils, etc.  I am so jealous of women with pretty hands and nails.  Anyone have suggestions or tips?"
"I have been suffering from dry-mouth for over 6 months now. I tried to pin-point exactly what was causing it, thinking it was an allergy, but no-dice."

"When I went to see my doctor she asked if my family had a history of Sjögren's Syndrome, and I told her they don't. When she looked in my mouth she said it looked like oral thrush and prescribed me some anti-fungals and sent me to the lab for blood-tests."

"The anti-fungals did not help, and all my tests came back normal. I hate to say it but I wish I had tested positive for the Sjögren's antibody just so I could finally know what's wrong."
I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a rheumatologist that is knowledgeable about Sjogren's in Toronto. The one I've been seeing for the last year dismisses any of my issues by saying that the dry mouth and eyes are just a nuisance I need to deal with. My family doctor seems to know more about Sjogren's than my rheumatologist (thankfully!) and has been really helpful.


"Just wondering if anyone here has had any luck trying the AIP diet? Just ordered The Paleo Mom book and am looking to start in the next week or 2 and would like to here of any experiences. If it did help, which symptoms did it alleviate for you, if not all? The dry mouth and fatigue is what I'm struggling most with an while I've read anecdotes of people's energy levels being improved on AIP, I've not seen anyone comment on whether it helps at all with the dryness."

"Also if any UK people have done this diet, is supermarket beef etc ok? I've read that it's mostly grass fed here. And if you have any recommendations on beef liver pills/collagen/bone broth let me know!"
"I was recently diagnosed by a rheumatologist. He the gave me two 2-page handouts, one for Sjogren’s and one for Plaquenil, saying he’d see me in 3 months if I started the medication 6 if I didn’t. That was it. After diving into the internet, this seems insufficient. I’d like to find a rheumatologist who specializes in Sjogren’s but I’m not sure where to look. Any help would be appreciated, it has all been a bit overwhelming. I’m in Austin, Texas if that helps. Thank you."
Can someone reccomend an offer the counter eye drop that works? My dry eyes are really bad!
I have been reading that a common joint problem for someone with Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) is Sacroiliitis.

"My MRI does not show any sacrum issues, but the doctor says I have Sacroiliitis. I’m trying to find ways to minimize the inflammation and pain. Does anyone have any suggestions? What meds work best for this condition? What physical therapy techniques are best?"

Thanks all!
"Dear all, I hope you are having a wonderful weekend! Has anyone had luck reducing symptoms with a diet such as the Autoimmune Protocol or other?"
Does anyone use a vibration exercise machine? If so what brand/ model and where did you buy it from?

My doctor recommended getting one but I’m lost as to which one I should get.

Thanks in advance!

"I am so thankful to find this group.  I am going to a Rheumy on 10/15 for the first time.   I've had a variety of symptoms for many years, like 35 years.  I recently had a carpel tunnel syndrome nerve conductivity test, and the neurologist said I do not have Carpel Tunnel Syndrome.  I find that very hard to believe.  He suggested a Rheumy.  My GP took bloodwork, and it was all negative.  Reviewing my history, I may have Sjogren's, and it may have had it since I was a teen."

&#x200B;

"My fear is that the dr doesn't believe me, since there's no result in blood work.  I plan on sending him my history via email, because I don't have the confidence to review all my symptoms while in in the visit.  Any suggestions would be appreciated."
So I've had repeated UTIs since March and chronic kidney pain and muscle weakness since November. Sometimes the pain flares horribly.  Should I get checked for RTA?
Will knowing about this increased risk make you want to take preventative measures?

"Annnd if anyone had cognitive issues now,"

"I just don't know what to do...I'm all dry, and it's   even worse in the summer. It's going to be my first whole summer with Sjogren and I'm already depressed."

"My bedroom is upstairs, and it's getting hot...when the temperature gets to 25°C, both of my nostrils are stuffed so I end up breathing through my mouth at night. So I wake up every hour coughing with a dry mouth. I'm already dealing with chronic fatigue, and I get memory loss and a bunch of cognitive problems from it. It's ruining my life."

"When I wake up at night, my mouth is so dry my tongue sticks to my bottom teeth, and my inner cheeks to my teeth. Now that I'm awake I can't get rid of the irritated sensation. It burns like hell. My jaw, teeth, gums, tongue etc are in pain."

And the heat isn't even at it's worst. So what are my options?

"I can't sleep somewhere else than in my room. I don't have an AC device, i could buy one but I've heard it makes dryness worse? Even people without a dry mouth get a sore throat from AC..."

How do you guys deal with Summer??
"hey fellow sjoggies, I'm going through a flare and trying to figure out the symptoms of it as they're more severe than normal. This of course would happen the couple days following me starting 2 new things to try and curb my flares..."
the 2 things are:
1. sauna use
2. drinking celery juice.

"These are two things i've read in a lot of places are meant to reduce inflammation so i've been going to the sauna weekly (spending about 30 mins in total but getting out to cool off every 5/10 mins) and juicing a couple sticks of celery the last couple of mornings when i get up. I wasn't expecting miracle improvements but I wasn't expecting what I got either, which is horrendous fatigue, headaches (that i dont normally get) along with extreme dislike for bright lights, and I'm quite feverish too."
"I haven't really felt like this after the sauna use up until today, and i've been going for 5 weeks now, so I'm not sure that is causing my issues, but it could be. Has anyone else ever experienced discomfort after doing either of these 2 things? Can you offer any alternatives or remedies for these symptoms?"


A few people have mentioned prescription vitamin D for inflammation. Is it a different compound than available off the shelf at the pharmacy? What doesage is recommended?
TIA.
"Hi, I'm male 26 y/o."

"I got a 3 on the Schirmer test after visiting the opthamologist the other day for dry eyes. My eyes were at their typical wetness that day. She asked me if I had a history of taking Accutane as a teenager and I told her yes. When she asked me this everything just clicked in my head. I have so many other unexplainable problems. E.g. chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. Had multiple prostate exams, prostate fluid checked, urine tests, cystoscopy, dilated urethra, CT exam for stones, everything negative. This has been going on since before my 22nd birthday. I also have had eczema since I was a pre teen. My eyes are terribly dry every day and when I wake up. My mouth is also dry but it is not nearly as bad as the dry eye. I took Accutane for probably a little less than 6 months when I was ~15-16 but I stopped it early. Trouble with memory/focusing. Depression on and off since age 19. Anxiety my whole life. Just now learning to control it. Random joint pain in right femoral head when I step with my right leg sometimes. Hips, knees, shoulders sometimes crack."

TMJ syndrome (My jaw used to catch when I was about 12-14. I would open my mouth and it would catch on itself and be very painful. That finally stopped but lately it has been popping like my shoulders and knees). Should I see a rheumatologist?

Have tried Fish oil for 2 weeks and it doesn't seem to do anything.
However I've found combining saw palmetto and cranberry extract helps with the prostatitis (for anyone looking! - 150 mg morning and night of saw palmetto. )
Hey y’all!

"About 13 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. Then about 3yrs ago she was also tested for Sjogrens using blood work. The blood work was negative, but I have since read and seen documentaries that say that lip biopsies and tear duct tests are more accurate. She exhibits many of the symptoms associated with Sjogrens, but it has never been reconsidered by her physician. Unfortunately, many of the medications she is on for her other autoimmune diseases overlap with Sjogren’s treatment."

"Question though: How many of y’all had other autoimmune diseases accompanied with Sjogrens? Anyone test negative with a blood test, but positive for the others?"
"Hi everyone, I am posting on this site regarding a research project I am conducting. This project will be investigating the relationship between autoimmune disease, depression, anxiety, and depersonalization disorder. If findings suggest a connection between autoimmune disease and these forms of mental illness, the hope is that this will contribute to further research in treating individuals with these illnesses, and that potentially we will learn more about how to separate the physical symptoms of an autoimmune disease from the mental symptoms. If you are interested in participating in this study, you need to be 18 years of age, it will only take about 30 minutes of your time, and it is completely anonymous. I am also an undergraduate student conducting this research so it will really help me in furthering my education and future career. Thank you!"

Here is the link if you are interested in participating:

"Hello, new to the group and new to Sjogren's. My biggest issue is scabs in my nose. They make it feel like I can't breathe! Anyone who's experienced this issue with suggestions?"
"I was diagnosed with RA 3 years ago, and my doctor’s focus has always been on that. About 6-ish months later, I told her how dry my eyes and mouth were, and she mentioned Sjogren’s, and that it was a commonly found comorbid disorder."

"I’ve suddenly had this swelling in my parotid area, and it seems it must be connected to Sjogren’s. My wonderful rheumatologist left her practice in January, and I don’t see my new one for a few weeks. I’m seeing my PCP on Wednesday, but I was hoping for any wisdom or advice y’all might be able to provide. I look like a half chipmunk!"
Have y’all found a good primer or foundation that doesn’t leave your face looking super flakey? Everything dries my skin out.

"For me, it was dry eyes. I started dating my husband nearly 30 years ago. When I kiss him, I close my eyes. But, ever since I can remember I could only open one eye at a time because one would be stickier and stay shut longer while I was trying to pull them open. It was kind of embarrassing, but I had no idea it could be key to my failing health."
"if it's numb afterwards, i won't care that much tbh but swelling would bother me."

thanks in advance
Has anyone tried these for dry mouth? Did you dental health improve? Any side effects? Thanks in advance!
"The tip and top of my tongue, the roof of my mouth, and my lower front teeth aren't salivating.  Been kind of on and off for the past few months."

I have burning mouth on my tounge and roof where the skin is llike raw.
"Diagnosed 6 months ago.  Started plaquenil.  Since then, I have episodes where my parotid glands are swollen and painful.  THen may go away for a few days, and return. They are visibly swollen, he said.  I really don't want to start taking another med!  Any other on methotrexate for SS?"
"I am 38F and have primary SS, Hashimotos, MS, and thyroid cancer."
"I have horrible muscle pain in my thighs, calves, and forearms, wondering if anyone else experiences this?"
"I know...I have a lot of illnesses, they are all recent diagnoses in last 2 months (cancer was diagnosed Dec 6th after facial pain and swelling). I am not on strong meds for most of this cause my symptoms are mostly mild. The muscle pain started just days ago and with a ton of research and talking to all my specialists, it seems to be the SS."

"I'm struggling enough as it is to manage all of them. Any thoughts or ways to help it would be appreciated, OTC pain relief isn't helping and I'm a single mom of 3, can't take narcotics. Thank you and happy holidays."
"Went to rheumatologist back in may for unrelated issue.  He noticed my left  gland was larger.  Ran every test you can think of for RA, SS, etc.  Only the ""early"" sjogrens came back positive.  and an ultrasound showed enlarged parotid."
"Put me on Plaquninl 200 mg/day.  Over the last month, things have gotten worse.  I would get a sore throat for a couple of days, then my glands started hurting, and sore throat gone.  I have a metallic taste in my mouth.  But the sides of my cheeks are constantly hurting/throbbing.  It is just a dull, throbbing pain.  Can't sleep well because of this.  What do I do?  I am scared.  Can't see my dr until next year unless there is a cancellation."
"....And they're normal. Which probably means SS is off the table for me. Bittersweet, as cool that I don't have a disease, but takes another thing off the table. Sigh."
Is it a Rheumatologist that diagnoses Sjögren's?

Are there any other questions she should ask her PCP? She has had debilitating dry eye pain for some time and wanted to know if it could be related to Sjögren's.

Any advice is appreciated - thanks!
"Hi, I've been tested for Sjogrens after I told the nurse that I had chronic burning/dry eye problems and the test came back negative. I've been dealing with the eye problem for about a year. I've also had unusual symptoms of excess salivation and unusual taste in mouth for about a year and a half and also constipation and very dry bowel movements. The excess salivation may have been caused by excess catecholamine production due to intermittent fasting I've been doing. I've since stopped intermittent (one meal a day) fasting so I'll see if that goes away and my mouth becomes dry. The fasting can also influence lympocytes so it is possible my test may have been effected. I was doing the fasting to help with brain fog and fatigue that often happens after eating. I am also cold all the time unless the temperature gets above 80 degrees. This started more recently a few months ago."

I may also be having problems with my throat which just started. I don't seem to have a problem swallowing but I am getting some random sharp sensations in my throat that has been going on for about a month.

Defecation can be painful and there is often a lot of blood on the toilet paper and sometimes in the water. The unusual thing is that when I wipe there is normally nothing on the toilet paper at all which is not has it has been all my life. This clean wiping thing has been like that for over a year. Some time after that the pain and blood started. I wonder if my body is not producing mucin in the digestive tract. I've told my primary care physician about all these problems. He referred me to an ophthalmologist and they had no idea what was causing the eye problem.

"I've also had fibromylagia, for  over 10 years which includes jaw and neck pain and a lot of other pain and unusual neurological sensations and too many other symptoms to go into here. These sensations feel like numbness below the eyes and wet water sensations in the legs or other places. I also have ringing in the ears."

I had a metal wire fixed retainer made of stainless steel put in my mouth about 15 years ago when the health problems started. I just recently realized that the nickel in there could cause an immune problem causing fibromyalgia and other problems so I had it removed about a month ago. I'll see if any of my problems go away.

"I'm scheduled to see my primary care doctor again to follow up in a few weeks. How do these symptoms, especially the digestive ones relate to Sjogrens and your symptoms and history?"

Thank You
Hi all
"I've been diagnosed with Primary Sjogrens as well as Fibromyalgia. We're in Uk but moving to Spain next week so the rheumatologist said she wasn't going to put me on plaquenil as she wouldn't be able to check how this was going. I'm to find a rheumatologist in Spain when we settle, which is fine."
I wondered if anyone had tried any supplements such as curcumin (turmeric) or alternatives such as cbd?
Thanks:-)
Hey folks.

"I've got a bit of a problem and I was wondering how other people deal with this problem. I'd like to use a hot water bottle to help with aches and stiffness, but I can't open the damn thing without hurting my hands. Am I missing a vital lie hack? Am I using the wrong water bottle?? Any advice would be much appreciated ^^"

Has anyone here experienced acne and skin dryness so severe that it causes the skin to shred off in sheets down to the red dermis? My chin is covered in red scaly patches that hurt constantly. I am seeing a dermatologist (and rheumatologist) but they don't seem to have any advice other than wait for the topical antibiotic/benzoyl peroxide combo I'm using to work. Thanks in advance if anyone has any ideas.
Wondering if this is sjogren's/autoimmune related
"I constantly have dry skin. My nose has always been like a weird dry, flaky and oily since I was about 7 or 8. My forehead is usually flaky in the winter time."

My mouth has been much drier in the past year to the point when I wake up it's like sandpaper. I get mouth ulcers and sores almost weekly.

"My nose has always been dry to the point I had several nosebleeds as a kid and I learned to either breathe through my mouth. When it's cold and dry I breathe in through my mouth and out through my nose, so that the moisture in my ""breathe"" moistens my nose. Even when it's ""runny"" it'll still be dry."

"My eyes usually feel dry, not very often maybe once a month or so I feel like there is a spec of dirt in them and I can rub them for 5 or 10 minutes and it doesn't help much."

"fatigue, but this could be due to lack of sleep."

"I'm 26 have had constant back pain for years, not debilitating but an annoyance - I've only seen a Dr once, got an x ray and was told I have arthritis forming in my back. My knees are sore often (although I am big, 215lbs) and my hands are sore at least one day a week and sometimes stiff depending on how I use them."

"I just feel constantly dehydrated, no matter how much water I drink I'm still feel ""dry"" - I've recently been thinking it was due to too much sodium intake as i used to eat fast food often and a lot of processed foods."
Lately I've been trying to eat healthier and pay attention to sodium intake and i don't think i go over 100% daily value (2400mg)..

"If I do manage to drink a half gallon of water a day I do feel more comfortable and if I eat super salty foods like Chinese, a 20 piece nugget or can of soup(high sodium), I feel it ""dry"" me out."

"Unfortunately, in my family I was brought up not to talk about problems and Drs were only for teeth cleanings and emergencies"
"Feeling like I've got the mumps and flu is bad enough but the constant pain and wooshing in my ears, the nausea, the odd bouts of vertigo, that really makes me a bit crazy. Last few days the SS part of things has been acting up. My ears physically hurt and they're noisy as hell. Plus I'm slightly nauseous and dizzy. I know this will pass along with the flare but man I hate this. The jaw swelling it's painful but my ears they woosh, ache and then constantly pop like I am on a plane. I've clearly got tube issues connected to the SS part of things. It's so annoying. I worry about my hearing but so far it's not been affecting that...(Knock on wood...)"
I didn't realize this was actually a thing until recently. I feel like my memory has gotten so much worse for no apparent reason. Do you guys also experience brain fog and how do you manage it? I don't want it to interfere with my work.
I really don't know all signs point to this SS. Long story shorter.

I have Psoriasis. And felt i was getting arthritis. i just had a basic blood work panel done last feb. so i asked my dr to test me for RA.  along with other stuff just everything if you could. He did another full blood work round.  Everything was normal minus the below (feel free to play dr like i do) It's highly encouraged.. So of course i google the not so normal results.. and i'm here so clearly i think i'm going to get the news tomorrow that I have SS.  Mainly more so than the jokes of playing dr. I really tend to get put on the spot and draw a blank. And end up googling what i could of talk to a dr about!   so I'm coming here first with what should I expect with results like this and any other questions to ask the dr if i do end up with this.


Play dr.. (What do I have from my blood work?) (also please more than anything help me with questions to ask dr)

RHEUMATOID FACTOR  normal range.

"ANA test Positive  pattern: 	Homogeneous"

"SSB/La Ab	49 UNITS in the Sjogrens antibodies"
so that's higher than the normal/average.

Everything else is in range. these are the only scores that scored out of range.
Will i need more testing? What should I expect


Also i really don't know much about it.
I have tears they come all the time. and my mouth is only dry when i smoke weed. my eyes do tend to burn a lot. sort of use to it tho. however the one thing i can relate to is the extreme tired ness ALL DAY EVERY DAY.
I don't want to down play or up play. but i'm really wanting to know how bad is this Sjogrens disease?
will i need to be disabled do i have to quit work (one day clearly today won't happen i'm functioning fine)

Are their other test i will need to get?

forgive me for being all over the place. it's sort of my thing. ;)




"It was about a year ago that I started showing symptoms. First it was dry eyes but I attributed it to having lasik months prior. It continually got worse and then my mouth started to get dry as well. At that point I went to my doctor, told her my symptoms and she did blood work for auto immune disorders. Sjogren's came back negative. And since my only symptoms were dry eyes and mouth she said it was most likely just the dry winter air and sent me to my eye doctor for some symptom relief. At that point I was pretty relieved."

"But winter came and went and my symptoms only got worse. Eventually I started to experience dryness in ""other"" areas as well, if you catch my drift. And that has made certain activities often painful. I'm not sure what to do at this point. My blood test was negative but from what I've read, 20% of people with Sjogren's have negative tests. Should I be asking for a lip biopsy? That sounds painful. And I'm not sure if there's really a point to being diagnosed with Sjogren's anyway since there's no cure or even treatment. I really want to stop dealing with this dryness. My mouth always tastes awful, even after I brush my teeth. My eyes hurt at night and in the morning. I just want to feel normal again."
Here's a paper about the co-morbidity of Sjogren's disease and gluten sensitivity.

"You can get a simple blood test for gluten antibodies as long as you remain on a diet that includes the gluten equivalent of 2 slices of bread daily. If you have any digestive disturbances as well as Sjogren's symptoms, you should probably get tested for celiac disease; it makes all other autoimmune diseases worse even if you don't have celiac symptoms you could still have the disease. Up to 20% of celiacs have what is termed ""silent celiac disease,"" meaning they don't report symptoms. Meanwhile their intestines are being destroyed from within."

Hey guys!

"About 4 years ago, I had a ton of blood work done that came back normal, but due to all the issues and symptoms I have had, the 2 Rheumatologists ruled that I have Sjogren's. Would like to mention that I also have Hypothyroidism, IBS and a gluten allergy...anyways, I was prescribed plaquenil about 3 years ago, because of joint pain. For a while, I thought it helped, but I stopped about 3 months ago because I didn't see the point in continuing. I still noticed some things bothering me. Today, I am just so stiff after sitting for no longer than 30 minutes and I feel like my knees are going to break when I go up the stairs. My hands feel a great deal of soreness too. I am wondering if it really is Sjogren's? Or I have something else? They tested me for RA and it came back negative. The soreness is starting in my hips too. The weather is getting brutal, so could that play into stiff joints?"

Im 22F btw!
"So about 2 months back I started having neurological symptoms. Tingling sensations, imbalance, some blurring in vision. I went to taiwan to visit my family and get my condition checked out(no insurance here), and the neurologist prescribed B12 which helped alot. Optometrist gave me an eye exam and gave me two eye drops saying everything was fine except my eyes were probably dry and in need of rest and that oil in the eye was causing some vision blur."

"I was okay for a while until I started getting some symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, brain fog, mild heat flashes, mild headaches, dry mouth and more vision problems(floater in right eye). I then started getting IBS like symptoms like random abdominal pain and some bouts of watery stools/diarrhea."

"I went back to the US and started taking some multivitamins prior to this and during my whole time in the states, my dry mouth was completely GONE.  Some symptoms still persisted and my vision was still a lil weird. I took myself BACK to taiwan bc of the diarrhea persisting and now I'm currently undergoing some tests. Awaiting results for ANA/ENA, SED, some other things. Was tested negative for celiac Iga, h pylori, HIV, and my previous tests prior to leaving taiwan like CBC, homocystein, iron/tibc(?), all came back fine, though I was vitD deficient. Will consider CT scan and capsule endoscopy to see if innards are good."

"I'm a 23 year old male of Taiwanese ethnicity. Family has no history of autoimmune disorders, my mom had a hyperactive thyroid I think, and her mother had type 2 diabetes. I've had worries as to what this could be like Crohns, fibromyalgia, etc. I suspected Sjogrens because of the recent random joint/nerve pains, persistent achey lower back, fatigue, dry mouth which CAME BACK, upon returning to taiwan oddly. Diarrhea and most gut pain has now subsided it seems. I sparingly use eye drops now but I have noticed my eyes have been ""burning"" but not ""red"", they don't feel as dry as they much as they are ""burning"". Any person looking at them would say they're perfectly healthy. I don't know what to think honestly. Considering lip biopsy but IDK if docs here are skilled w it."
"Hi all. I don't make a lot of money and it is very stressful to not know how many outstanding bills I have, how much they will be, when they will appear, and when they do appear what they are even for. When they arrive I always get a panic attack followed by eye pain and difficulty seeing well. Has anyone figured out a decent way to reduce the impact of medical bill stress?"
"Background info: As a child, I've always been teased about being small and weak. I grew up around some great friends, not to mention were (and still are) very athletic. I often wondered why I was always short of breath when doing the simplest tasks, but accepted that I was simply born smaller than everyone else."

"Fast forward to college. I was exposed to more stress and exhibited a drastic weight loss. For years, I had discoloration on my skin and I rarely went out in the sun unprotected. An extremely good day for me would be a day where I had no commitments. A commitment as simple as going to lunch exhausted me. I've always thought there was something wrong with me. Friends would always mistake my exhaustion as disinterest. The truth is, simply sitting in a chair feels exhausting and made my heart palpitate. I ignored this for some time."

"Fast forward another 3 years. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology and hopped right into a full-time career in Early Intervention Case Management. It was a stressful time, but to know that I transitioning into adulthood made me feel extremely fulfilled."
"Now with that being said, I thought, hey! Maybe I shouldn't see my pediatrician anymore since I'm 22......."

"I made my first appointment with a primary care physician who is also a pulmonologist. Took a bunch of exams: allergy, breathing, urine, blood, etc. Doctor looks at my results and notices I have a 42% breathing capacity. My blood test had an SS-a/Ro level of 8.0. My first response was no fucking way I've been alive for this long, I must be wolverine or some shit. Then I explained how I've always felt and how things are now: skin dehydrated to the core, ever-constant fatigue, white spots on my skin, no appetite, weight loss. His immediate intuition was to refer me to a rheumatologist, who did a more in-depth blood test and confirmed I have Sjögren's syndrome. I did a PFT/CPEX (pulmonary function test/cardiopulmonary exercise test) and the breathing capacity still came up around 40%. My doctor concluded that due to sjögren's, my lungs have hardened due to poor lubrication which resulted in scleroderma, which shows on my skin as well."

"It's been a rollercoaster of emotions, and I've been having such trouble finding the voice to be open about it. On the outside I'm really good at putting up a front as if I feel okay, and I don't want to constantly put it in everyone's face that I don't feel okay.. but I know that it would be of my utmost benefit to really put myself first."

I don't know how to explain to people that I don't want to drink for a while since I'm starting on plaquenil and trying a gluten-free/vegetarian diet. I might be the only one holding myself back. I just... don't know how to ask for support.

Any resources or forums on where I can talk about this stuff?

Anyone have a mascara that doesn't cause them to be in agony??? I got the Almay hypoallergenic/sensitive eyes and it causes horrible pain and redness. So much for making seemingly informed decisions.  The few times a month I want to look alive I'd like to be able to wear some eye makeup.
"So, I got all these tests about 2 weeks after titrating off a 6 week prednisone regimen for bad hives."

"No RF which has always been positive before and all my antibody tests were negative, including TrAB which has also never been normal before (I was diagnosed with Graves disease years ago, as well as celiac disease, so have a lot of other autoimmune stuff.)"

I have EVERY single primary Sjogren's symptom including terrible dry mouth and dry eyes.

Do you think I just got tested too early coming off prednisone? Has anyone else ever had false negative testings for this reason?

"I've been sick for 30 years, thought when I was died for Graves, celiac and B12 deficiency...each time I thought I'd finally get well. I haven't been able to work this whole time because of extreme fatigue and cognitive issues. So fricking tired of this."

Hey again!
"Sorry for hogging the spotlight. I was hoping to get some advice on what to ask my eye doctor now that I'm newly diagnosed. Momentarily using eye drops and gels for lubrication, as well as Zaditen for inflammation.  (also taking fish oil, flax seed, curcumin, etc. in case anyone's interested)"


Do any of y'all have experience with these?

-Restasis (as opposed to/in combination with Zaditen)

#NAME?

-Pilocarpine (my rheumy doesn't like to describe these due to side effects)

#NAME?


Thank you and have a lovely day   ^ _ ^
"Does anyone have a brand they really like? I'm about to spend a week and change in the alkaline Black Rock desert and I'd love to find a brand that works well in advance. I sometimes use the Cera Ve face lotion for my hands and that works pretty well, but their hand cream is essentially the same as vaseline (which I've also used before). Any recommendations? Thanks in advance."
"I'm a 40 year old woman. For years, I've been struggling with a mix of health issues; my sister was recently reading about Sjogrens, and told me I should get checked by a doctor. After years of pretty crummy experiences with doctors, and a list of diagnoses with little relief or improvement, it's hard for me to get excited about *another* potential ""issue"" for me to have. On the other hand, from what little reading I've done on this, it sounds like Sjogrens could be what ties it all together. My list of issues, big and small, not all of which may apply:"

* Vulvodynia
* Interstitial Cystitis
* IBS
* Blepharitis
* Dry eyes (had to stop wearing contacts years ago)
* Photosensitivity
* Dry skin
* Hypothyroid
* Rosacea
* Migraines
* Sinusitis
* Vertigo
* Chronic yeast infections
* Dry mouth
* Dry lips - I have Chapstick placed strategically throughout the house so I am never without one.
* Dry scalp
"* Terrible tooth decay; every tooth has a filling, and I'm now working my way up to crowns on several, possibly root canals. I brush, I floss, doesn't matter."
* Fatigue
* General muscle and joint aches
"* Depression...because, honestly, who wouldn't be depressed after dealing with the list of shit above?"

"Listed out like that, it's a lot of stuff. Probably not all relevant, but figured it didn't hurt to put it all out there and get your thoughts. These are all things that I've seen individual doctors for, with varying rates of success/improvement."

"My question is, do you think there's any possibility this could be Sjogrens? If so, what are my next steps? What kind of doctor should I see? Does anyone have a recommendation for a good doctor in Orange County, CA? Thanks for any help or advice."



"I'm starting to keep a pain diary and I realize that I consistently have the most joint pain before and during my period. In the last two days I've gone from some mild knee pain to full blown stiff hands, huge swollen wrists, back and neck pain, elbow pain and knee pain. I'm having super bad dry eye and dry mouth... Nothing is touching it. My dry eyes are to the point where it's painful to be in bright light and I feel like there is constantly a grain of sand in my left eye. And yet, somehow nothing ever shows up in my blood work. All of the literature I've read on Sjogrens talks about association with menopause but doesn't talk a lot about symptoms in women who are still having normal periods. Anyone else experience this?"

"I'm on exovac, plaquenil and restasis but my Rheumatologist is hesitant to give me anything else without a firm diagnosis. I've been on the plaquenil for about 4 months now and restasis for about 3 and have noticed and improvement in my fatigue but that's about it. Any insight?"
"One thing I hate about autoimmune disease and in this case Sjogren's is how painful my ears can get. It's not just the glands, my actual ears just ache sometimes and my hearing which is usually pretty acute is sometimes affected a bit. I'm lucky so far, not losing it, but it admittedly scares me the thought that I might. Autoimmune disease fucking with my bones that's one thing. Affecting my ears and eyes, that thought just drives me crazy. Ice blocks helps some, but nothing totally cures that pain when it happens. Last few days it's like I have a mild ear ache in both ears and my glands are swollen again. I hate Summer. It makes me feel so shitty..."
"Hello all,"

"Been trying to get some help all over reddit for this, and found my way here, hoping to track down an answer."

"Background symptoms: Fatigue, no matter the amount of sleep I never feel refreshed. Pain in arms (Shoulders through hands, mainly in joints) Muscle fatigue, I can't hold my newborn for more than 10 minutes without having lots of arm pain."

"After lots of xrays and ultrasounds, I got referred to a Rheumy, and he ran some blood work, including an ENA, which came back SSB positive."

"Now my ANA's have been negative throughout this ordeal, and research has told me a Positive ENA with a negative ANA is unlikely, and further, a positive SSB with a negative SSA is rare."

"Also, I'm a 28 year old Male.. meaning in general an Auto Immune condition would be rare."

Any thoughts on what this could all be?
"So today I finally got in to see an ophthalmologist who did a Shrimers test. I had 4mm in the left eye and 6mm in the right. He categorized this as ""mild"" dry eye, but didn't find anything else in his exam indicatve of Sjorgens. With my UCTD diagnosis he did offer restasis to see if it helps. He said it will take a few months to see any difference with it though. He also didn't find that the plaquenil had done any damage to my eyes, which is a huge relief as I've had a lot of relief from arthralgia symptoms from it (though not so much the dryness all over my body... Ocular,vaginal,mouth, skin, etc)."

Has anyone had a lip biopsy? Who performed this? Did your Rheumy recommend it?

"Also in the diagnostic criteria they have listed objective tests of dry mouth. My dentist is totally clueless and doesn't know any objective measures of dry mouth, though I'm most obviously experiencing it. My Rheumy is great but I don't get to see him again until August so  hoping to get some other testing results (negative/positive either way) to move forward with my diagnosis."

My blood work was negative for SS/A SS/B antibodies the first time around but do these things ever shift over time?

Thanks in advance y'all!


Do you find your symptoms wax and wane over long periods of time or can they change more drastically when switching phases?  Have you noticed anything that triggers a change in severity?

"I am not diagnosed, and preliminary blood work comes up negative, but I have a systematic dryness problem so I have been following Sjogren's Syndrome for treatment ideas."

Right now it seems my symptoms change more abruptly and I'm trying to figure out why. Is it normal for Sjogren's? Am I encountering some trigger? I'm hoping you can share your experiences so I can try to answer these questions.

"Just poof! Yesterday I stopped producing enough saliva again. And my tongue feels all dried out and taste is muted and suddenly a soreness stretched across the side of my tongue. At this very moment it feels like the dryness is spreading moment by moment to my lips, nose, eyes, scalp, cheeks, etc."

"This has happened before and just as suddenly disappears or fades quickly away. Mouth dry, then gone. Eyes dry, then gone. Sinuses dry, then gone. But this is the most severe mouth dryness I've experienced so it has me asking questions again."

Is this sort of symptom changes normal for Sjogren's? Or should I start looking at a different path?

(my doctors have no clue what is wrong so I'm on my own here)
"After two weeks of major URI the Sjogren's part of my autoimmune thing decided to kick in with a vengeance. I woke up this morning all red eyed and looking pretty much like a chipmunk. I took some arthritis Tylenol for the pain and grabbed a blue ice pack and a hand towel. People always wonder why I have half a dozen blue ice packs in the freezer? Days like this are why. I can't hardly stand it without them. My whole face hurts...OW!!!! Talk about adding insult to injury, but I half expected it. I've been coughing, sneezing, et all for two weeks. I figured the saliva glands would get pissed off too eventually..."
"My mom has  Sjögren's Syndrome and is also a simple woman who thinks her entire life is a burden to others, and therefore refuses to take care of herself or anyone when she needs help or something is wrong."

"She's had SS for over 15 years, and 2 years ago noticed her right calf muscle had disappeared. She waited to see a doc until a month ago. The doc referred her to a Neuro muscular ortho(?) And after an EEG and MRI, nothing is conclusive. Now she's getting a spinal tap."

"But I just can't help but think it is SS related, and not back/spine (she had a slipped disc 18 years ago and had surgery top correct it, then a few years of chiropractor care...but she stopped the chiro 4 years ago... Then the muscle atrophy showed up)"

Any advice? Anyone else experience muscle issues?

"Thanks,"
"Anyone with SS ever have any liver issues? If so, what were they, what were the symptoms, and how did your doctor (and you) manage (med, lifestyle etc)."

Thanks.
"Hi, new to this sub. I'm not diagnosed with anything yet but met with a rheum last week about dry eyes, mouth and getting sick a lot. She is sending me for some blood work and a salivary gland scan. In the meantime she suggested the nighttime eye gel and a few other things. Today, i noticed a little white bump on the edge of my lower eyelid. Idk if it's a stye or something else. Not sure if i should keep using the drops I've been using. Anyone else have experience with something like this?"
Thanks.
Has anyone with SJ here had lymphoma? Do any of you get swollen glands frequently? I will be getting results to some blood tests in a week and an ultrasound Monday. I am not doing well emotionally.
"Welp, I'm at the point where if I'm in the car without sunscreen for 5 minutes my skin starts to hurt. So I'm planning to buy a tinted window cling, and wanted to know what y'all do for sun protection. Favorite sunscreen? Gardening hats?"


"I am a friend of SS, I was wondering if any of you with pSS have ever had to live in a dry climate (like desert-dry) and if so, if it made your symptoms worse/unbearable and what you were able to do to help to make living there more viable like humidifiers or other things.  Thanks!"


So. Long story short this has been happening for close to 10 years now. They've pinned it on Vertigo Migraines caused by caffeine and discharged me. Now I can't fault that. That's cured the vertigo and dizziness but nothing else.

"I still have postural hypotension (blacking out and collapsing (rarer now)). Still got tinnitus. Still get a funny taste in my mouth when ""blacking out""."

Trouble swallowing (not noticed a dry mouth as such though).

"Dry spit when I'm brushing my teeth? I thought this was just me. it still might be though. I'm never thirsty, ever."

My lips are very dry. But equally I'm an avid lip biter but I've spent a fortune on balms and it's only ammonia based ones (Blistex) that seem to do anything and then a thick coating of Lanolin balms.

Contacts are a nightmare for me. Always feels gritty and dry. I force through it and have drops. I still get them when I have glasses in but obviously much less. I physically can't cry with contacts in funnily enough. Just no tears come out.

My memory is impossible. Non existent for anything long term. It's like being in a mental fog all the time.

"I've got clicky sore joints that I can't pin causes on. Well the knees are back from the falls, but I'm not willing to be on constant Naproxyn to get 50% relief. I've also got an annoying TMJD."

Don't sleep well. Constantly tired to some extent. Equally I can be working a physical job between 4am and ending at 11pm so my sleep pattern isn't perfect.

My ANA test has always been 1:320. Never changed from about 6 years ago to a year ago. They just said it was asymptomatic. But with me always pestering about the vertigo and collapsing have I just steered them away from what it could actually be by downplaying or ignoring other symptoms.

Funnily enough the thing that made me look at Sjorgrens again was getting contacts and the lady saying I have quite dry eyes which never occurred to me before.

Soo yeah. I just don't have a clue. I'm going to try to get back into my GP over the next week but I'd love to know if I'm barking up the wrong tree and I'll happily lay it to rest and just carry on :)

"Edited to add: I don't do heat. I spent 3 weeks in bed last summer. I couldn't physically move in the heat. I don't like anything about being out in it, which is more the pity since it's impossible to find makeup when I'm this pale!"
"I have so many conditions/diseases I don't know which could be causing this, so I'm asking for help!"

"For about 3 years now I've had extreme nausea the first two days of my period, accompanied with headache, fatigue, digestive issues. Many things have been tested and rules out, and IUD tried, and I'm currently on birth control where I won't have a period."

My doctor thinks I may have developed an extreme sensitivity to hormone changes in my late 20s.

"I realize this is the sjogrens subreddit- but I have so many things going on and I need all the help I can get. Any advice, personal stories, etc. Would be appreciated!!"

"Edit: I do have sjogrens, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, anxiety, gran ulema annulare (I'm told is connected to sjogrens) and epilepsy and take many medications."
"Now that it's winter, the drier air is really tough to deal with. I find myself needing to use eye drops and saline nasal spray more during the day when I'm not at home. Dry eyes, dry mouth, dry sinus passages, dry skin... it's all worse since winter kicked into gear even with the Restasis and plaquenil."

"This week I reached out to the facilities group at work to ask about having a humidifier at my desk (I work in a cube environment) and have to follow-up next week with the environmental hygienist. At home, I have a humidifier in the main living area and another in my bedroom. Investing in a [humidity monitor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BKDO8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) has helped me to be able to adjust the humidity to comfortable levels, even understand what those levels are. This week, it's been so bad at work that as soon as I get home, I boil a pan of water on the stove to get some relief."

"I've learned that if I warm up my car really well in the mornings, use eye drops and nasal spray before walking out the door, and then turn off the heater on the way to work, that helps make the drive a little less miserable."

What do you do to take care of yourself during the drier months? Do you have any special tips or tricks that help? Are there certain products you use that you really like?
"I could really use some guidance/advice/suggestions. I woke Tuesday with sores inside my mouth, more to the front, but a general overall sensitivity going on, too. Today my lips are still really sore, to the point that smiling feels like it'll stretch and tear the tissue and the back of my tongue, inside cheeks at gum level is inflamed, really sensitive."

"In addition to the usual regime of Biotene rinse and a XyliMelts overnight to help relieve the mouth dryness, I started Rincinol rinse and H-B12 Melts to help with the sores. They're all OTC treatments.  I'm drinking plenty of water and just eating soft foods (chewing sucks). All this extra care has kept it from getting worse, but I don't think it's getting better."

"Little history: I was diagnosed with Sjogren's a couple months ago. Fibromyalgia a few months before that. I've been using Restasis for dry eye a couple months and that's improved. The rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil 2x daily for the mouth dryness which was so bad it was waking me in the night but not so bad I had mouth sores, till now. Before this week, that seemed to be improving somewhat."

"Am I expecting results from the OTC products I've been using too quickly? Is this increase in dryness something I need to tell the dr? I was going to call the rheumatologist today but thought I'd see if anyone here had any suggestions of what helped them or anything specific I should ask the dr. Anything's appreciated - questions for the dr, products you use for relief. What helps you?"

"Edit: if you've read this far. Thank you. The NP had an opening this morning and I took it. She said since it's only been a couple days, if it stays this bad, call her next week. I called my dentist, who's a really nice guy, and he's going to check on some products that might provide relief."

"**So, what products or medications or regimins do you use to relieve the mouth dryness?** Even my lips look chapped and I've been keeping them slathered in cocoa butter."


"My eyes are killing me. I was dx'd 4 years ago, after a bout of blepharitis and then subsequent testing. I have had a pretty easy go of it since, taking Evoxac for my mouth, dosing my eyes with tears 4x a day and putting gel on at night."

"This past week my eyes have been epic dry and sandy/gritty. I've been careful not to touch them, using tears (individual packs for cleanliness), gel at night, warm compress, etc. No luck. It will get better for a day maybe, then worse again. It's so bad right now that I am struggling to even keep my eyes open because they are so freaking dry."

I'm going crazy folks. Any advice?

"Also, I thought I remembered my doctor giving me drops for this but he says there aren't any. Is he a lying poop face?! I can't function like this."

"Sorry for whinging. I have 4 auto-immune things and 2 other chronic illnesses and I this one is the most annoying, painful, horrible, evil one."
I've been diagnosed with Sjögren for about 1.5 years now. I'm a 33 year old male. The biggest thing for me has been the fatigue. Fatigue comes and goes usually on 3 months cycles and when its at its worse doing literally anything is too much and when its allright I try to exercise a few times a week by walking and running.

As I was talking about it to my massagist she recommended me on trying on L-Arginine as a supplemet. She said it's been helpfull for some of her other patients suffering from Sjögrens or similar disease.

Been using it for now a week and the difference on fatigue levels or overall physical performance of surviving a day is immense. I'm currently on the fatigue cycle and basicly walking to a grocery store has been a big thing to do but I noticed huge difference on taking just a pill a week ago. It's also somehow helping my mental state as well and my mind feels a lot more clear. I'm currently experimenting with taking 2x 2000mg daily and thinking about getting L-citrulline also to boost the L-arginine.

Theres some research overall on L-arginine and L-citrulline being helpfull on joint pain but reading those research papers have been too much to my non-native english skills. Might be the lack of understing on cell-level things also.

So I'm asking if there's someone with any relevant research or any experience on taking L-arginine or L-citrulline?

I'd like to make a reference post of online support groups. Anyone have ones they would recommend?

"Hey guys. I've recently discovered that vitamin E oil is a very good way to treat dry skin. I have particularly bad lips and this is one of the only things that soothes them. You can buy it at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and probably pharmacies. I'd love to hear what you guys think if you try it!"
"I would like to preface my post by saying I do not have a diagnosis of Sjogren's, but I'm talking to my doctor about it. I've had dry mouth for many years now, and I've only recently (in the past 2 years) found out about biotene toothpaste and it was the only one I've ever been able to use without burning my entire mouth. However, they've recently changed the formula and the Biotene now burns my mouth as well. I hear it's popular with this community and I wondered if any of you had encountered the same problem. If you know of any alternative I'd like to hear about it. And if you've had this problem, have you called them to complain? Perhaps they will change it back when they find out their customers are dissatisfied. Thanks for reading!"
"I've had a nagging cough over the last week or so and grabbed some cough syrup. I accidentally got the DM style instead of the D style, but I did a quick search and it looked ok. Not so much. The Guaifenesin caused me to get dehydrated and has caused a flair. Anyone else have problems with it?"
"I just found this sub today, and wanted to stop in an say hello. I don't have Sjogren's, but my mother does. She also has RA, and pulmonary fibrosis caused by the Sjogren's. She decided a few weeks ago that she's now too sick to work, and is starting to process to get disability."





"Anyone who has Sjogren's had their sex hormone levels checked or given testosterone in some form? I know there have been quite a few studies on mice and how administration of testosterone decreases lymphocytic accumulation in lacrimal and submandibular glands. Other studies point to androgen deficiencies in conjunction with Sjogrens. However, I haven't read much about this outside of those studies on mice. I'm just looking for more info on this connection and which direction researchers and the medical community are going."

Here's one of many studies: http://www.iovs.org/content/40/6/1261.short



"I got into the pulmonary specialist finally.  He diagnosed me with bronchiechtasis.  He said I have had the pneumonia virus since December.  I did a lung cat scan last week.  Yesterday we went over the results.  The good news is I don't have the above.  I have no lung or bronchial damage.  The bad news?  He feels it is the Sjogren's targeting my lungs.  I have to do a nebulizer twice a day, steroid inhaler twice a day and antibiotics the first week of every month."
So far it has not helped.  I have spent the past week with a low grade fever working it's way up the thermometer.  I am calling him again tomorrow for advice on getting rid of the fever.  Does anyone know anywhere that has advice/discussion on organ involvement in SS?  I am fed^up !!!The SSF is next to useless.  **Rant!!!** over
Thanks for being here.
"I've lived in AZ most of my life and don't have any experience with other climates.  The sun, heat, and dryness are causing me a lot of grief as time goes on."

"I was thinking that maybe the pacific northwest might be better.  Less sun, less heat and more moisture in the air.  It's colder, which may cause more joint pain."

I'd love to hear your thoughts/experiences on the ideal place to live with this disease.

I'm trying to figure out things on here to make things a bit more appealing and organized.  You should be able to give yourself your own flair now if I did it correctly.  If something doesn't seem to be working or you have suggestions for post flair please let me know.

/r/Invisible

/r/lupus

How do you get all your water in and keep from getting dehydrated?

"The Sjogren's has been screwing with me neurologically, lately.  Over the last couple of days, I have been having very sharp and sudden pain on the soles of my feet, along the sides of my hands, and the pads on my fingertips.  It's like a deep unexpected papercut.  And it's happening ALL.  THE.  TIME.  I have never experienced pain like this before.  What the hell?"



Background..I was diagnosed with sjogren's in 2004.  Until then I was told my many symptoms were from fibromyalgia.  FMS does have over sixty symptoms but I had several not listed anywhere.
The dry eyes and dry mouth are a common part of this disease but unfortunately they are a minor part.  doctors focus on treating this and nothing is being done for the rest.  Research is very limited and also mainly for the dryness.
"I have severe respiratory problems (walking pneumonia 5 times this year, regular pneumonia, bronchitis, strep, sinus infections) over all body pain, fatigue etc. I'vebeen told treatment outside of treating symptoms and living on antibiotics does not exist."
I hope y'all can offer suggestions or information.
TL:DR Tired of no treatment or research being done for this disease. Tired of being sick with no options.
Anyone have ideas to get this sub going?
"With the idea that there's a reddit for everything I was happy to see this one, but sad to see what looks like a deserted reddit.  Is there traffic here and people just don't post or is it dead dead."
"I am undiagnosed because I have no insurance. I have a direct pay doctor who is trying his best.  He is hesitant to diagnose me because he fears there may be more. I have almost every symptom listed on Sjögren’s foundation, plus so many mentioned here."

"I have developed a new issue. I have this unrelenting neck pain, sensitivity to light, reading makes neck hurt worse. I do not have a headache."

I read about something called trigeminal dysphoria hay seems to describe what I gave been struggling with for days.

Has anyone heard of this or have solutions. I can’t seem to read without neck pain. It stops for a few minutes and then returns.

Help!!
"Hi everyone,"

"I think I might have sj, but I wanted to see if others with sj have the same symptoms and could share their experience. I am absolutely fed up. I'm currently seeing a eye doctor, I'm having regular oil gland squeezes and I'm using manuka eye drops."

I have dry eyes and my lids are always swollen.
My vision is blurry most of the time and my eyes strain.
"I get frequent headaches, especially towards the end of the day. I feel like someone who is dehydrated and it causes pressure in the front of my head and aches in my neck."
"I am always thirsty, no matter how much water I drink i do not feel like I'm hydrated."
"This year alone I have had several bouts of tonsillitis, to the point I was hospitalized and on antibiotics for 2 months."
Generally my throat always feels dry.
The area under my eyes...cheekbone area aches most of the time.

"Also, in the last couple of years I had a range of tests done for other health related things."
I have had 2 tests come back with a positive ANA... at different times.
"I didnt really think much of it at the time, I didnt really understand what it meant & just never followed it up."

Would like to hear your thoughts.
Thank you.
"Hi there, newly diagnosed. I wasn't even thinking about dry mouth last week, but this week it's gotten so bad it's really affecting my quality of life. I think I'm having a ""flare"" - if I get it under control, will my dry mouth improve at all?"

Hi everyone. My doctor is adamant that I have chronic fatigue syndrome. I recently found out about sjogrens and it makes much more sense to me.

I have had dry eye forever as well as dry mouth. I use artificial tears frequently and dry mouth mouthwash. I strongly believe it's sjorgrens.

I have two questions for those diagnosed:

I have always been able to cry tears. Is that a sign I DON'T have sjogrens? And also my ANA tests came back negative. Is that also a sign I don't have it?

Thanks in advance!
I have Sjogrens and my RA prescribed Cevimeline HCI to help with dry mouth and eyes. Does anyone have experience with this prescription. I have only been taking it a week and all I’ve noticed is my armpit sweat like crazy now.
"Hi, I hope everyone here is well."

&#x200B;

Just a quick post to check if anyone here has experienced something similar to what seems to be an unusual illness.

&#x200B;

"I had two masses appear rapidly and synchronously approx. 3 months ago, one on each parotid gland, just below my ear, at the angle of my jaw. They are very hard, fixed, roughly ovoid, painless and currently around one inch in diameter. The skin above is completely normal."

&#x200B;

"In the last couple of weeks I have developed a further solid, moveable mass, approx. the size of a peanut in my left cheek. I have also found a similar lump in my right cheek, about the size of a ball bearing."

&#x200B;

"The main swellings were very large and appeared hamster-like previously, however they have shrunk recently and thankfully my head is much less spherical now. The ones in my cheeks appear to have shrunk a little too."

&#x200B;

I have no symptoms of dry eyes or dry mouth whatsoever. In fact I don't think I have any other symptoms at all.

"Suggested causes so far have been Sjogren's syndrome, sarcoidosis and lymphoma. Sarcoidosis tests have come back negative so far and lymphoma seems extremely unlikely. Sjogren's also seems very unlikely to me but I thought I'd check in here."

Has anyone here had parotid swellings like this?

Wondering if you've had any luck with it?
"I had a lip biopsy yesterday for my Sjogrens symptoms. I was googling whether or not the lip numbness I have today is permanent or temporary (it said about 3 months, fingers crossed) when I read the standard is to remove and biopsy 5-7 minor salivary glands. He took 2. I am so desperate for a diagnosis and horrified I could potentially have a false negative and a numb lip for nothing. Is 2 enough?"
"Lately, since getting a FitBit, I've been aiming for an average of 8h sleep, currently averaging 7h 45m. This has been extremely helpful in lowering my overall anxiety levels. But I have also learned a bit about dryness & comfort levels."

"Often I'll wake up at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and then get up, use the bathroom, take 4-5 gulps of water, yawn if I can (to produce tears), blink some more, and pop in a breathmint (lol). This makes me feel a _lot_ more comfortable. Then I'll sleep for another 30-90 minutes and feel very good while doing so, in that my symptoms aren't at all a problem."

"This made me wonder about changing my overall sleep schedule to include more ""breaks"" of this kind. One benefit might be that the dryness is far less of a problem because I'm able to stay more hydrated and comfortable overall. In the past I used [sleepyti.me](sleepyti.me) to manage more restive sleep & wake junctures, and that helped a lot. After reading [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16964783) about sleeping in two four-hour segments, I thought about maybe combining the two approaches. For me, 4 hours might be just short enough that the most severe dryness buildup doesn't happen."

"Has anyone tried altering their sleep or taking ""breaks"" during the night? What's been your experience? Thanks!"
"I had my first primary care visit in 7 years today. Although it’s not for sure yet, my pcp is leaning towards me having Sjögrens and a possible autoimmune thyroid disorder. I’ve had parotid glad swelling for years, so often that I have rubbed the skin there raw to relieve pressure. Before this I’d never heard of Sjögrens. If this is what I have, what can I expect going forward? I have an appointment with an ent as well as extensive blood work scheduled."
Learned yesterday that Sjogrens Syndrome A and B antibodies are strongly associated with neonatal congenital heart block and neonatal lupus.  According to my lab report at least.

"Recently discovered I am positive for both antibodies in addition to a long history of ANA and Raynaud's. No other Sjogrens symptoms though.  Female, nearing end of birthing years, but haven't yet had the opportunity to experience the joy of pregnancy.  Wondering if any SS Ab carriers out there have heard from their doctors about potential neonatal complications. Any of you experience pregnancy with, or without, said complications?"
I was diagnosed with Sjogrens last month. I also had blood tests done sometime after and part of the results were:

> SJOGRENS A >0.2

> SJOGRENS B >0.2

"I wont be able to see my doctor for another two months, but am curious what this part means."

Please and thank you!
I’ve been on it since 2015. I think I remember having withdrawal symptoms in the past when I was late filling the rx. Ran out yesterday so couldn’t take my morning dose. Today/tonight I have a migraine with nausea and having to go to the bathroom a lot. Related?
"I had never heard of Sjögrens until my endo and ophthalmologist mentioned them to me on separate occasions. My endo did an ANA screen, which came back negative, and suggested I pursue other tests with my PCP for a referral to rheumatology. My question is this. What tests should I be asking for? If the antibody test came back negative, is it likely that anything else will show something useful to a diagnosis?"
This condition still has control over my life as I barely can keep the effected eye open and it’s in excruciating pain sometimes

"My wife had a very negative reaction when taking Cipro to fight an infection. It seems that it caused every signal to go off in her body. Eyes became blood shot, mouth dried out, every muscle ached and spasmed, and her temp shot up to 102. When I got off work I found her and she could not even talk, so I took her to the ER ASAP.  They started off testing for the flu, negative, then strep, negative, finally they gave her meds to counteract the reaction. So while waiting I went to NCBI and found several articles saying how this is known to cause flair ups."

Has anyone else had any cases like this?

Also be careful out there!!
"I’ve spent the last year going through major extractions and dentures, prior to that I had worked really hard at losing weight and used IT to control my IBS and reflux issues. My father has spent decades on pills and I really wanted to avoid meds as long as possible. Let’s just say I’m stubborn."

My new doctor was adamant about putting my on cymbalta. It’s been a night and day difference for my sleeping and overall mood. It has however made my other symptoms more pronounced.

Now that I can eat and I’m not at the dentist every week I can finally focus on things. It may seem silly but I did Irish Dancing for 20 years and I really want to get certified as a teacher. I want those letters after my name. But the fitness component scares me now.

Does anyone have any tips on combating exercise intolerance?
Let me preface this by saying I haven’t been diagnosed and had never even heard of this until an endocrinologist mentioned her suspicions that I have it.

"I’ve had several ongoing symptoms that I thought were related to my hypothyroidism, but evidently they do not. I guess the one that concerns/scares me the most is my heart rate. It bottoms out at 40 on most days. It will drop from 75 to 40 and jump back to 70 something over a span of two minutes. Is this possibly a Sjogrens related thing or something entirely unrelated?"

"(No, I’m not just a super healthy athlete with a low resting heart rate either, hah!)"

Does anyone else get pain in their jaw area when eating sour/bitter foods?
"I don't have sjogrens, but I had a biopsy for lip inflammation that left a scar. The doctor told me beforehand they were just taking a sample of skin cells, and it would heal without a scar in less than a week. However, they made two incisions and removed some tissue from the front of my top lip slightly off from the center. I have a vertical cut line from where the  stitches were that looks almost like a cleft lip scar, there's a hard lump of scar tissue, some numbness, discoloration, and my lip looks lopsided, because they removed such a big chunk. The middle of the bottom part of my top lip is pulled off center (if that makes sense). It looks even worse when I smile."

"The doctor told me to rub vaseline into the scar (which didn't seem to help) and apply hydrocortisone cream (which I didn't do because of the side effects). And she offered to use a laser to burn the top layer of skin off my lip, which I declined, because she said it might make it worse. Also she kept pushing back the healing time frame. After about six months, she said that's as good as it's gonna get, and if I care this much about a scar I should see a psychiatrist. I later saw a plastic surgeon who said he could cut out the scar, but that would still leave another scar. And I don't want more of my lip removed."

"This  happened over ten years ago. For the first couple years, I massaged the scar practically every day with oils like sea buckthorn, jojoba, rosa mosqueta, coconut, squalane, essential oils, etc. I tried scar creams like mederma, a snail cream, and balms with herbs like comfrey and calendula. There's been almost no improvement. There's still the cut line that looks really bad in certain lighting and a hard lump of scar tissue. I know I can't regrow the tissue that was removed (please correct me if I'm wrong), but if I could dissolve some of the scar  tissue it might relax my lip and the middle wouldn't be pulled so far over. Any advice or product recommendations would be greatly appreciated."
Hello everyone! Hoping I can get some advice on eye relief. I started having eye pain and burning about 8 months ago. Went my dr recently and she did a bunch of blood tests and the ANA test came back positive.

I was referred to a rheumatologist who can't see me until April. Does anyone have any suggestions for eye relief until then?
Meet with a  specialist and I handed him four sheets of symptoms of what’s currently going on with me and he declared that I probably have Sjogren’s.
he says the big symptom was that anytime in the past several years that I’ve had antibiotics I always end up feeling a lot better overall.
Said I should speak with the rhumetest but I need to find one that is aware of the relationship between anabiotic’s and Sjögrens as most aren’t.    And if the one I talked to didn’t know about that I should just find another one.  He knows a good one.  But he’s two hours away in another state.

So I saw one today and she said that there’s no relationship and she’s never heard of that

He was also saying that there’s a good chance my blood work would be coming up negative which makes it so hard to diagnose.
I definitely have a whole lot of the symptoms.


As best I can figure from my research antibiotics have no affect on Sjögren  itself but it seems like infections of the lymph nodes are very common in Sjögren. so maybe that’s what’s making me feel better

Anyone have thoughts?  I’m not sure what to think.
"Heya,"

I wondered if anyone had any tips/experience with getting diagnosed on the NHS?

"My background - I see an eye specialist once a year who monitors my dry eyes (punctal plugs, ongoing problems for the last 5 years) and a rheumatologist at a different hospital for various undiagnosed joint problems (the worst being severe knee pain) which started 7 years ago. I also have various other untreated problems with dry skin, dry nose (sometimes bleeds, sometimes is just irritated) and dry mouth (I am constantly drinking water)."

I have always been of the belief that these problems are not unconnected but it’s hard when my consultants don’t talk to each other. I had some blood tests at the eye hospital a few years back (don’t actually have the results so don’t know which tests but I know they were looking for Sjogrens) which were negative but obviously false negatives occur!

I have appointments with both my consultants in the next month and really want to push for further testing as my eyes are getting worse but don’t know how to bring it up without being treated as a hypochondriac. Any advice much appreciated.


Background:

"32F, Dx with Primary Sjogren's in 2016, also have PCOS w IR."

"When I was initially dx, I had bloodwork done and had a weak positive ANA but it had a cytoplasmic speckled pattern. I had a positive result for SSB (repeated many, many times) and elevated C3. I went on a steroid taper for the elevated C3."

"Since diagnosis, I went on plaquenil 400 mg a day and recently gabapentin for muscle spasms and migraines."

"This fall, I started having episodes where I would wake up in the middle of the night with a horrible stomach cramp that I couldn't speak through, run to the bathroom, and basically leave a toilet bowl full of blood. This happened to me about 3 times. I also have an ongoing issue with fissures, which my colorectal surgeon says looks like a pattern of autoimmune issues b/c they are on the anterior wall which is very unusual unless you have autoimmune issues in that arena."

"Basically my GI/ colorectal person suspects lupus and a rare complication called bowel ischemia. My Rheumy saw me at the end of December and thought more like IBD, which runs in my family. I have been limited in my diet lately- a lot of things make me have stomach cramps or diharrhea. I have been basically eating pasta, chicken broth with white rice, rotisserie chicken, very cooked canned vegetables, and occasional mashed potatoes. Anything else causes me distress."

"My Rheumy did bloodwork in late December but seemed unconcerned but she ordered more than normal. Anytime I have had an abnormal lab (high C3, other issues) her nurse just calls me and tells me what prescription they've phoned in, answers questions, etc. I got a call today that I have to go in and see my rheumy at the soonest possible appointment and essentially that they aren't really going to tell me what's happening or post my results to the portal. Now I have to wait until Monday. I am super pissed and very concerned. I wish they would just tell me what's wrong and then I can come in to follow up. They don't even call if labs are normal so I know something has to be off."

Have you ever had this experience? Am I super off base to be pissed and (very) worried?

"So I've got some gnarly systemic symptoms that good ol' HCQ is struggling to manage. I've been given a steroid injection to calm things down, but when that runs out, there's a 50/50 chance my symptoms won't be gone and I'll have to start on azathioprine. I'm really not keen to (increased lymphoma risk...as if ss wasn't already enough, proper immunosuppresion), but if the other option is complete incapacitation then I guess there's not much choice."

Has anybody here taken it? Side effects? Has it truly helped you?
I woke last night with awful pain. I thought I needed the loo so I went for a pee. This didn’t relieve the pain though.

"8 hours later I still have the pain and my stomach is swollen. I’m not sure whether I maybe constipated (although I’ve had a bowel movement this morning), I feel there’s more there if that makes sense. Sorry tmi !"

I’m currently slugging down water as I don’t know what else to do. I’ve never had this pain before and I wonder if it’s the Sjogrens drying things out internally  ?

Can anyone else relate to this ? Thanks in advance :-) any tips or advice welcome.

"I didn’t eat anything different yesterday, I drank more coffee than usual as I was quite tired. I’m on no meds for the Sjogrens apart from pain relief when needed and topical drops ointments etc."

"Edited to add: I’ve been tested for Celiac previously and biopsy was negative, doc thought I maybe sensitive but was advised to carry on as usual"

"Hello, I hope it is okay to post. I have had soft/liquid stool for several months, debilitating fatigue, bloody nose, gritty eyes, waking up with my mouth feeling dry as a cracker. Pain all over, not sure if joints or bones, everything pops all the time."
"Limbs go numb easy. It becomes hard to think, all of this affects my mental illnesses."
I saw a GI and we went over some things but my primary doctor I will be seeing next week and I need referrals.
"Two years ago I hiked the Olympic National Rainforest. Now, some days, I can barely make it to the mailbox and back."
"Now on top of these symptoms, I am getting thick mucus coming up, sometimes with lots of bubbles. I am gagging, retching, and wheezing."
I am new and very overwhelmed. No official diagnosis yet. Could anyone give me some general advice?
"Hey all, I'm new here.  I may have Sjogren's but I have not been definitively diagnosed yet, I'm still in the very early stages.  I just saw my optometrist last week and while this disorder has been on my radar, I purposely avoided mentioning due to being wrong in the past and just described my symptoms to her.  Thankfully she volunteered the possibility of Sjogren's with instructions to see a dentist before coming back to coordinate with her again.  So, that was a huge relief."

"Here's the short list of what's going on with me: dry, gritty eyes including waking up in the middle of the night feeling like my face is packed full of cotton; dry, itchy nose; history of apthous ulcers and dry mouth, which seem to be worsening; issues swallowing food and pills, voice hoarseness (I used to love to sing, lately I'm finding it painful); angular and possibly exfoliative cheilitis; GI issues including dyspepsia, gastritis, IBS, gastroparesis, GERD (these have all been diagnosed by my GI doctor); worsening asthma and increasing respiratory infections despite zero IgE-mediated allergies.  A few years ago I began having gallbladder attacks and had it taken out, only to find it was inflamed but acalculous.  I have a mental health history as well (mostly depression and anxiety) which doesn't seem to help anything."

"My frustration with all of this is that most doctors I've seen only treat one system for symptoms. I get that, they're experts in a specific field and have so many patients to handle.  And while I can't say I like all of my doctors, I do genuinely believe they don't write me off.  They've put me through a ringer of tests, but everything comes back normal or inconclusive.  I just don't understand why I feel so bad if everything is within normal parameters."

"Anyway, I apologize for that wall of text.  I'm trying not to let this get me down but it wears on you after a while, and I'm honestly afraid of pursuing this only to be told, yet again, that the bulk of it is in my mind.  I have a young family I need to be there for, I'm back in school for a health science program, and I live an active lifestyle.  I don't want to let this, whatever it is, defeat me."

"So, I guess in addition to being a vent, I had some questions.  1) I had angular cheilitis several years ago that wouldn't heal for about 3 months.  I attributed it at the time to vitamin deficiency from a vegan diet and haven't had issues since returning to a more standard diet.  More recently though, I seem to have ""flares"" of painful exfoliative cheilitis and patches of dry numbness or red painful patches on my tongue.  Can these issues flare and remit, or are they pretty much constant once you develop them?  2) I became pregnant with my youngest following a bad ""flare"" 2.5 years ago.  She seems to be a healthy almost 2-year-old today.  She had no issues at birth and hasn't had anything pop up in any well checks.  Should I be at all concerned about heart block at this point?  3) How much does family history play into this?  My paternal grandmother had plaque psoriasis and my father may as well.  Additionally my maternal grandmother complained frequently of dry eyes and mouth, but I don't believe she was ever diagnosed with any autoimmune disorder, so perhaps it was just genetic or age-induced dry eye."

"Wow, that was a lot.  Thank you for your time.  I know no one here is a doctor but the camaraderie is appreciated."
Did anybody gain weight on Evoxac? Did it eventually go away? Did you find a way to control the weight gain? Thanks.
"I've gotten a really bad cold 8 weeks ago. The cold itself went away in 2 weeks. Since then, I've been getting unbearably bad symptoms."

"I've done a lot of standard blood work. Only ESR was elevated 3 weeks after my cold, which seemed to have settled into the normal range."

"One of my doctors ordered my ANA, Rhuemotology factors, SSA, and SSB. They came back normal except ANA which is 1 160."
The rhuemotologist just dismissed it without further thought.

I still have the dry eyes/mouth. Does anyone know if it's too early show Sjogren antibodies or Autoimmune positives on these tests?

I've heard that it may take longer to show antibodies. Not sure if the same goes for lip biopsy.

If anybody has suggestions on blood panels to get for early autoimmune or has comments on the accuracy please let me know.

"The cold virus I got is long gone, but it has derailed my health completely. Been to a ton of doctors with nobody knowing what's wrong with me."
"Hi,"

I have had Sjogren's for a few years. For this past week I had what I think may be a new symptom. I have an angry bump on the side of my tongue that gets sorer throughout the day and almost feels like a sore throat by the end of the day (I wake up in the morning without this pain). I had been hoping this would resolve but it hasn't. What type of doctor would you see for this? Rheumy? ENT? Oral surgeon? Dentist? I have had dry eyes and mouth lately and just ordered more biotene so I am hoping that helps some. I don't think I have thrush but there is a light white coating on my tongue. Any insights would be appreciated. Has anyone experienced this?

"Thanks,"
So I (24/M) have been 95% sure I have Sjogrens for a while but have yet to be diagnosed.

"It started about 4 years ago when I had a viral ear infection called Labrynthitis, and had a sudden onset of the following symptoms:"
Severe fatigue
Dry mouth/difficulty swallowing
Dry eyes/sensitivity to sunlight
Dry hands/feet/lips
Occasional loss of balance
Frequent urination
Impaired concentration/memory loss
Digestive issues (IBS-like symptoms)
Occasional loss of balance
Excessive sweating
Dental Cavaties

I understand these may not all be related to Sjogrens but this is all that's happened to me since I had the infection.

I have had so many blood tests over the past few years and found just elevated liver bloods and slightly low vit D. Had a couple scans on my liver and nothing showed up and I supplement vit D but feel no different.

"Finally I found out about Sjogrens and everything started to make sense, especially when I saw it's often triggered by viral infections so I suggested it to my GP to get tested. Had the ANA tests and nothing showed up so she emailed the results and my symptoms to a rheumy who said he doubts it's sjogrens and that's it? Didn't ask to see me or anything, just ruled it out through blood tests."

"I've been tested for all the normal things like diabetes/anaemia etc and nothing, so I'm not sure what the alternative could be? Is there something else I should be asking them to check for? Sorry for the long post I just really want a diagnosis so I can try to move on with my life it's been hard, my mouth is so damn dry 24/7! If you have any suggestions on what else it might be please suggest!"
"I’ve noticed some correlation, but I’m not sure if it’s significant. Could the cutting into and exposure of the inner eye cause an autoimmune response? Those of you who haven’t had LASIK, have you had any similar eye injuries? Maybe I’m reaching, but I’m extremely curious about this."
If i don’t take care of myself when I get a flu things go in an unexpected way. I mean I feel so ill. I think this is a consequence of Sjögren syndrome.
Do you agree?
Or it’s just me and my imagination.
Hi my dad has trouble  with headaches  he found that no caffine helps but twice  a week he get debilitating  headaches  is there any thing that i can so to help him or any thing he can do
"My follow up is Tuesday for some concussive tests (I hope!). But overall I've been told by my ENT this is the most likely. I have had my parotid swell about 6 times in 10 years but just put a warm cloth on it and went my way. However recently it didn't go down for 5 days and I had to take antibiotics and 4 Advil a day. Then my submandibular glands popped up after.  Along with this my eyes and mouth have never been so dry. Like unbelievably dry which was not common for me. I've ran a 99.1 average temp for about 3 weeks...right before this happened and still to this day. And my joints are uncomfortable, I wouldn't say pain but almost like when you have the flu coming on..."
Either way this is what they are testing for. I'm 38 years old and male. What do I expect with this? Will I just have dry mouth and eyes plus occasionally a gland infection or swelling? Plus joint pain? Or does this get worse?

Thanks.

Edit: I've been light-headed for about 3 months as well which is what started my doctor experience. All CBC came normal.
"Hey everyone,"

"I have a job that requires me to frequently sleep away from home. Ive got a giant anti\-reflux pillow at home, but it's too big and heavy to take with me. Does anyone have any tips on how to create the perfect incline \(or anything else that might help\) with easy\-to\-carry materials? Any advice would be much appreciated! =\)"
"My wife has experienced Sjögrens symptoms for may years before being diagnosed 9 years ago. Apart from the dryness, fatigue, joint pain and muscle pain, two issues she experiences frequently are changing vision, sometimes from hour-to-hour, and chronic dry cough. The vision issue requires the use of multiple pairs of eye glasses, and many times none help at all. The cough happens multiple times per day and often results in vomiting. She has seen all types of specialists multiple times, as well as her GP. Gastric reflux is frequent and is sure to contribute to the cough. Just wondering if these symptoms are familiar to others. Thanks."
"Hello! I'm in some desperate need of some help and direction on what I'm going through at the moment.  My health/mental health and life is in shambles right now, and I am about 100% sure I am suffering from autoimmune disease. Let me preface that I am female and just turned 30 years old back in January. Also, this probably will be a lengthy post, as this has been an ongoing struggle."

"First off, I am not sure which auto immune disease, however, I am suspecting Lupus, Hashimoto's, or Sjogren's. My symptoms include: neck stiffness, neck pain, particularly under my jaw and under where my ears connect, sometimes the pain is severe, sometimes it's a nagging type of pain, also it is usually accompanied by heat and a burning sensation, in which my face and neck area will get hot, to the point I have to splash water on my face or press something cold. My face stays red, which people comment on, however, I am also pale and have freckles, I have redness on many areas of my body. I also get a low grade fever that accompanies this. I am also experiencing joint stiffness in my hands, feet, and one of elbows. The joint stiffness is mostly in my finger joints and toe joints, particularly when I am laying down for bed. Also, when I I lay down to bed, I am experiencing horrible calf and foot cramps, and man they are annoying and painful! The cramps are more recent and more frequent. I am having some stomach issues, as well. For example, I used to have a very normal bowel movements and solid, but I'm now experiencing constipation issues and a tugging feeling or full on my right side. I also previously suffered from debilitating menstrual periods. I once had a period last nearly 5 months, another for 3 months. Until recently I battled through this for years and years, with no luck. I am now on Nuva Ring and so far, they are controlled and normal. I am also having skin issues, which I believe to be from a compromised immune system. I ended up in the ER last year with swollen, red, itchy, and painful calves and feet. The  ER doctor (who was an absolute nightmare) said it was cellutis and gave me nothing and did nothing, sent me home after my bloodwork came back normal. OH, how could I almost forget..the horrendously dry skin! I have always been on the dry side, but damn, my skin is a desert! I also exfoliate like crazy..so much skin! These are most of my physical symptoms, although, I'm sure I'm forgetting a few."

"I am also experiencing (feel like I have typed that word 100 times just in this post, sorry) mental health problems, which I have dealt with since my early teens, but nothing has been done till recently, which leaves me where I'm at now. Last year, I finally found a wonderful, yet expensive GYN and have had bloodwork, pap smear, and vaginal ultrasounds performed. Everything has come back clear  (including all past paps). I was for certain that everything I have been slowly dealing with and accumulating was stemming from gynecological issues, now I am not. I am seeing a new GP and had more routine bloodwork done last week and was given Paxil and Atenolol, my BP was high. Before this past year, I have not had a steady GP, only a GYN. I have told  my GP my issues, but what do I specifically need to do? I also do NOT have insurance, my boyfriend/fiancé of 10 years is pretty much taking care of the both of us, as things have hit such a head that I am unable to work and have put grad school on hold. I honestly feel like my entire life has been on hold, as I am also avoiding friends, family, and unable to even hardly leave the house. I am in desperate need of some direction on what I should do next? Thank you for taking the time to read..I truly appreciate it!"

Today I woke up blind in one eye completely not able to see out of my left eye. I also had eye pain when moving my eyes and was seeing flashing lights.  My eyes have never been an issue with my sjogrens if this has  happened to anyone before does anyone have any tips to help this go away or help the uncomfortableness.

"I was diagnosed with Sjogrens last summer by biopsies & shirmers, bloods neg. Sjogrens primary and fibro secpndary."

"Since then we’ve moved overseas and I’m still waiting to see a rheum here.  For the past couple of months I’ve had increasing joint pain, dryness, fatigue etc. since yesterday my asthma has flared up something chronic, I’m using my reliever a lot which I hadn’t used for months before. My chest hurts and it rattles and I know myself that a hospital visit is on the cards. However what I wonder if this can be related to the Sjogrens or is it just coincidence?"

Thanks for any input
"I was recently diagnosed with Sjogren's B and Low Gamma Globulin (which is the opposite of what usually happens with Sjogren's). Thanks to insurance restrictions, I have a lousy rheumatologist and I'm not even convinced that's the right doctor to see. Low gamma globulin can lead to lymphoma so I'm a bit unnerved and unsure what to do next.  Two questions that I would super appreciate some guidance on:"

1) I have an allergist who's also an immunologist (I have lousy environmental allergies). Should I see her?

2) The rheumatologist prescribed Plaquenil. Anyone here have any good or bad stories to share? Should I even be taking this with the low gamma globulin?

So grateful that this sub exists and it looks like there's some great support on here. Thanks so much in advance.
"I have inflammatory dry eye disease. Meaning that the dryness sometimes leads to some pretty bad corneal inflammation (eyes are on fire and feel like they are full of thumbtacks, around 2 feet of blurry vision). Sjogrens was suspected when it was diagnosed, cause of some recent developments it’s now really suspected."

"Up to now the inflammatory episodes have been pretty rare, but they’ve been getting more and more frequent. My opthamologist has up to now been resistant to prescribing steroids unless they were really necessary, but I have an appointment soon and I’d like to get a prescription for one on file so that the next time I have an inflammation I can use it without fighting my way through the hospital emergency room only to be inspected by the ophthalmologist who inevitably prescribes me a steroid."

"What should I ask for? The steroids I’ve used up to now were Tobradex (Tobramycin/Dexamtehasone) because at that point my eye was both super inflamed and infected, and FML (Fluorometholone). I’m biased towards Dexamtehasone because it works pretty much the next day, but I know it’s really bad in terms of side effects. FML I’m not the biggest fan of because although it works I takes longer to start working and I have to put it in 4 times a day. I’ve never had any increased intraocular pressure from any steroids."

Advice please? I’m 20 and male btw

"As a side note, anyone’s eyes made ALOT worse by lack of sleep? It’s now 3 times that I’ve only gotten a couple of hours of sleep and I’ve woken up with steroid required  inflammations."
"Male, 20."

"I have dry eyes, to be exact inflammatory dry eye. What I mean by this is that the dryness I have sometimes leads to some nasty corneal inflammation that needs steroids. Before this was the only issue I had, but recently a couple of other things have emerged. I used to take some meds that causes dry mouth and the dry mouth was always kind of mild, but now if I take a medication that has dry mouth as a side effect my mouth turns into the Sahara desert, it’s like sand. Also I developed eczema around two years ago that’s now gotten a bit worse, and also I now get pain in my knees and hips if I don’t move for a little bit, my fingers are also super stiff and hurt, cracking them relieves it a bit but not always."

"I had a blood test and ANA was negative, but that was 4 years ago. Other than ANA, what else can I get tested that might help? My ophthalmologist recommended to other bloods tests (can’t remmebr the names which is a real bitch) that might help, since he suspected Sjogrens again after the eczema surfaced and now again since it’s gotten worse."

So what other tests can I get done?

Just curious if anyone here took Accutane at some point in their life?
"hi all,"

i have extreme dry eyes and mysterious neuropathy in both of my hands

"i'm interested in a lip biopsy, but if my mouth isnt dry...at all, would this be an accurate test?  thanks!"

"ALSO, would i know if my salivary glands were swollen??"
Hi everyone!

"First off, I'm very grateful to have a community such as this one and the other Sjogren's communities online. They give me a lot of personal strength as I struggle with my own so-far mild conditions of the disease."

I'm a 31 year-old male and I was diagnosed with a blood test about 3 months ago after having chronically swollen parotid glands and migratory joint pain that has worsened over the past year. I've also had the random bout of fatigue but always chalked it up to odd one-day fevers.

"In any case, my rheumatologist has told me that my symptoms are not too bad. He's recommended that I check up with him every 6 months for more blood tests, but hasn't put me on any medication since I seem more-or-less okay to him, managing symptoms as they come. For the most part, symptoms are gradually worsening though and I'm finding myself relying more and more on ibuprofen to deal with joint pain that sporadically arises throughout the day. I've already got an appointment with the doc, but the whole situation has gotten me thinking about long-term drug effects."

"Does anyone in this community have worries about long-term effects such as GI ulcers or kidney failure? I haven't researched too many other auto-immune drugs, but I'm sure they have a plethora of problems associated with long term usage, too. Are you guys and gals as paranoid about this as much as me? I'm definitely going to talk this through with my doctor, but sometimes I feel like he's reciting from a textbook when talking to me and I often like to hear the human side of things."
"I'm getting this feeling on my arms, could it be an autoimmune symptom?"
"Hello,  newly diagnosed with SS last week.  I wear eyeglasses (38f) and have always wanted contacts,  was wondering what anyone had experienced with contacts and any advice while using them with SS. I have never used them before."
Thanks!
"Recently had some blood tests to check for this since my symptoms have become physically unbearable recently. This runs in my family so it's been suspected for some time, but since the summer my symptoms have become worse. Also has my appendix out about two months ago which feels as though it's kicked my possible Sjogrens into overdrive, and now it runs my life."

"I have a lot of the classic dryness/achy symptoms but these are bearable. The one that is making me unable to leave the flat is the sickly nausea feeling. I literally feel like I'm on the edge of throwing up all the time. Less so when I'm in my own room, but as soon as I get up to do anything I'm holding back gagging. I can't talk for long periods of time without feeling sick or tired or wearing out my throat. I haven't yet been sick, but I've been very close a few times. I can't easily leave my flat, pretty much."

"I may be having to defer a year of university because of this, which actually breaks my heart, but I literally cannot make it to lectures in this state.  Hoping to get the blood results back in two weeks to find out if it is this or not."

Anyone else had the aforementioned sickly feeling? And if so was it Sjogrens and how was it treated? Could really use some support here.

20yr/Male.
"I've only been taking it since since Aug 11 (just over 3 weeks) What is your experience with it? I've only had diarrhea when I don't have a big meal with it. But with the plaquenil I haven't really been hungry. any tips to calm my stomach if I don't have a big meal? btw I take it 2 at a time so i dont have to have big meals twice a day, I'd rather have 1 big meal."
Does anyone have any good studies or personal relevance of psychiatric symptoms seen in Sjögren's? I'm specifically looking for things like bipolar disorder and OCD. Please and thank you!
"Hi, I'm new but not new to SS. I was diagnosed back in 2001 and been on Plaquenil pretty much since then. My last rheumy appointment it was suggested I try the Rituximab injection but the ""black box"" warning scared the shit out of me. That was 2 years ago and since then I've done research but been too scared/passive to try."
Does anyone have any experience they'd be willing to share? I feel like the Plaquenil isn't cutting it.

"So I'm new to the board and highly educated in physiology (if that matters lol). My sjogrens started during my benzo withdrawal; I have been clean 1 year.  With the best of my ability I am mostly convinced sjogrens stems from the gut, ( leaky gut syndrome and the like) and I have been following the protocol. That being said I've only seen a slight decrease in symptoms ( although I do feel healthier)."

Here are some of my beliefs. Does anyone want to agree or refute them?

"1. Gut damage (villi inflammation and separation) can let excessive foreign bodies into the bloodstream and cause high demand on immune system. ""Foreign bodies"" my consist of undigested food particles, toxins, or undigestible parts of food that normally pass through such as insoluble fibers. Immune system ""tags"" foreign invaders and will attack them no matter where they end up I.e. The gut, joint capsules, salivary glands."

"2. Immune system (macrophages) will damage body tissues in order to get to the foreign invader that is housed in the salivary glands, oil glands, or joints."

"3. Excess physical, chemical, or emotional stress wears down the immune system so those  can cause or worse symptoms"

Let's just start there someone please help me out cuz I'm still sick 😤😤😤
"Hi,  my mom has been diagnosed with Sjogrens before by her nephorologist. She was referred to an otolarynologist. We went to him and he ordered a specific blood test. He also wants her to do a lower lip biopsy to send to a pathologist to confirm she has Sjogrens.  She's scared/nervous about it. And if the biopsy is confirmed, he wants to put her in chemotherapy."

"So, I just wanted to know if the lower lip biopsy is standard procedure, and is necessary, because it sounds invasive, albeit a doctor already diagnosed her prior to visiting the otolarynolgist."

"Thanks for reading. I'm glad I found this subreddit so a resource for second opinions. I usually go with my mom to her medical appointments to advocate and translate for her, b/c English is not her first language."

Thanks again.
"For the last couple of years I've been dealing with dryness all over but especially in my mouth, post nasal drip, tonsil stones, heartburn, and ibs. I had taken a couple of medications that had dry mouth as a side effect but I haven't been on any for quite some time yet I'm completely dried out in my mouth, whenever I was a teenager I took adhd medicine for about 9 months, accutane, and once I was dried out I used zzzquil and allergy medicine to help me sleep for around 2 years but I quit once I realized it can dry you out. I experience dry mouth, dry eyes as well as a dry vagina, my tonsils are swollen with a bunch of tonsil stones, my throat has a constant sticky feeling as well as a lot of mucus in my nose, I experience heartburn along with ibs,  and I always feel tired and I'm 24. I recently started working at a new job and due to how I'm feeling I'm having a hard time working there and I feel extremely uncomfortable and experience anxiety whenever I'm there. I've tried cutting out gluten, dairy, caffine, all medications beside the ones for dry mouth and although it helps with the ibs I'm still really dried out.  I've gone to a lot of doctors and they tested me for sjogren's and although they said my test showed inflammation in my salivary glands they don't think it's sjogren's and they prescribed me salagen and evoxac and it helps sometimes but I still feel miserable from being so dry.  I don't know if anyone has dealt with something similar or has an advice but either would be appreciated thank you."
I've come across a bunch of sleeping masks that claim to help with dry eyes (e.g. https://www.dryeyeshop.com/onyix-silicone-shield-p327.aspx?ShowReviews=True). Does anyone have experience -good or bad- with these products? They're a bit pricey when shipped to Europe so I'd like some opinions before I try them...
"I've been using a drugstore sleeping mask for a while, but it comes off during the night -_-"

"btw- Happy New Year, fellow sjögries!"
"So I was with my rheumatologist on Monday and he has suggested that the next step in figuring out WTF is up with my body is a MSGB. He also wishes for me to try plaquenil, since prednisolone taper didn't offer me relief. The MSGB could be this time next year for all I know since the healthcare system here is a shambles. I'm quite nervous - about the procedure itself and the results. What if they too, like my bloods, come back negative? :/ I know it would be better to not worry, I just can't seem to help it at the moment. I know I am inching closer to a diagnosis but at times it seems as far away as it was at the beginning. :("

Greetings -

"I apologize for dropping in like this, but I'm a little desperate. My wife was dx'ed with Fibro a couple years ago and now aware that she also has Sjogren's Syndrome. We've just been informed my wife will need 10 crowns for her tooth decay and we're looking at a whopping $11K bill while scrambling frantically for answers. Are there any good resources for how to correctly address this with our dental and health insurance so we get the maximum available support?"

"Despite the Sjogren's Syndrome and Fibro, I'm very proud of my wife. She's holding together through the delicate balance of family support, volunteer work and life management. Having to give all that up to go back to work to pay for this dental work will derail her progress. Is there any answer you would recommend? Thanks very much in advance ..."
"I'm a 24 year old female and have been experiencing dry throat lately. I noticed this after having slept with a fan blowing in my direction for just under a week, but the dry throat persists. Throughout the day it comes and goes and I've had trouble swallowing on occasion. Even breathing makes my throat feel awful and dry. That said, I don't have trouble producing saliva when I'm eating or anything. I also don't experience pain when swallowing."

"Another possible symptom is that in the past few months, on some days I've been waking up with a stinging sensation in my eyes that lasts a couple minutes and eventually goes. When they sting I just close my eyes really tight, waiting for it to pass, and some tears form. Other than that I haven't felt like my eyes were particularly dry and I don't experience the stinging any other time during the day."

"The only other thing is that a couple months ago I noticed a painless, pea-sized bump in front of my ear where the parotid gland would be. It was there a couple of weeks or so and disappeared but I didn't have any of the dry throat symptoms."

"I understand I can't be diagnosed here, but I'm just wondering if the degree of my symptoms could indicate sjogrens, or would the dry throat be much worse (e.g. not producing much saliva when chewing)?"
Could anyone share their experience with taking Cellcept and being around kids (or other major sources of germs) a lot?

"Although it isn't as bad as when she was a toddler, stepdaughter (6) brings home lots of fun routine illnesses from school and daycare, which I nearly always catch. The common cold can knock me out for 2 weeks, as I am sure many of you can relate to."

"She is a burst of sunshine who can change my whole outlook on life on days when I can do little other than lie in bed. It would be rough having to wear a mask around her, or limiting how much she can touch/breathe on me. However, if we cannot secure IVIG for me (looking unlikely with my insurance), I have finally decided I am willing to consider Cellcept."

"Any thoughts, experiences, or encouragement would be appreciated!"
"I constantly feel aware and irritated by the sensation of the dryness in my mouth and the difficulty I have swallowing. This hyperawareness just makes me obsess about sjorgens, and spiral into negative thought loops about it..."

"Have any of you guys experienced this, and if so, does it get better?"

"Thanks, and sending positivity to you all."
"Hi there! I'm currently in the process of trying to get a diagnosis - I meet with my doctor on Wednesday to discuss bloodwork, and I assume he will refer me to a rheumatologist because I'm already seen my test results online. Positive ANA, positive Rheumatoid Factor, Positive anti-SSA Antibodies, etc. In the meantime I am assuming it is likely I have Sjogren's and at least have a lot of the symptoms, especially dry mouth, swollen salivary glands, and difficult swallowing."

"Recently my sinus passages have been getting super dry (exacerbated by winter, I'm sure), and when I have post-nasal drip, I feel like the mucus is very thick and just sits in the back of my throat. I carry a 32 oz Nalgene with me and drink at least 3 of them a day so I'm constantly drinking water, and I've tried mucinex to loosen the mucus but it doesn't seem to do much. I also try to run my humidifier when I'm in my room and use a saline nasal spray."

"Does anyone have this problem? Is this a Sjogren's ""thing"" or related to the potential Sjogren's? Anything seem to help?"
So every winter my Fibro/fatigue seems to get much worse. My fatigue and fibro symptoms are pretty severe. This year I have developed a huge lump under my cheek bone. Symptomatic of an inflamed salivary gland. I did some research and found Sjogerns could be the cause. I remember complaining about 'small painful lumps' in my cheek to my doctor years back but thought nothing of it. (He didn't have anything to say about it either.)

I went to my doctor and asked her if I might have Sjogerns and she said no. I asked her if the huge lump on my face and all my fibro symptoms getting worse might be related and she said no.

"She said she thought the lump was in my skin and not my salivary gland (under the skin). But now I have developed a nice sized ulcer/canker type thing on the INSIDE of my mouth, on the SAME side as the lump on my cheek. Not to mention I feel the smaller salivary glands are inflamed in my cheek."

Now I'm not a doctor but these symptoms seem to be pointing to Sjogerns. Of course I could be wrong but I think it's important to rule out. I would really appreciate any advice.

Here are the issues that lead me to believe I might have Sjogren's:

"My SO has sjogrens.  Most days I feel like I'm passenger in a car that is hydroplaning off a cliff.  I have no control and nothing can be done to improve the situation.  He tries to maintain a good attitude and go out and do things with me, but then is miserable the next day.  The next two days.  The next week."

I'm completely out of hope and ideas of how to make him feel better.  Or how to make things easier.  Or how to lessen his suffering.

What are some things your SO does to help you?  Is there anything you especially appreciate?  Am I just doomed to helplessly plummet off this cliff?


I've had a sudden change in health and my right leg has had an increase in both RLS and neuropathy. I had blood work a few months ago that came back Ok. I'm also looking for a New rhuemy. In the meantime my NP has given me an rx that I'll pick up tomorrow to try and settle it out.  I wanted to know if you all might have an idea of what's going on.



The SS Foundation has an [article](http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/bid/232935/Should-I-get-the-flu-shot-if-I-have-Sjogren-s) up today encouraging people with SS to get the flu shot. Do you get it?
"To be honest I'm really embarrassed to ask this since I'm new to this subreddit, but I've never talked with people with sjogrens and I was hoping people could help.  Please don't judge if this is too ""forward."""

"I have issues with wetness, regardless of how ""turned on"" I am, or even not relating to sex.  My doctor said it is due to my sjogrens and that I should use lubrication and to think of it as a moisturizer in a way. I have to use it during sex almost every time, and it's really embarrassing, especially with someone new.  I don't like making them feel like they are not enough.  Anyone else?  Or any other sexual issues that related to sjogrens?"


Has anyone had a lip biopsy done? How did it go? How much did it cost? How long did it take to heal?
"Hi. So I had some labs done by my primary recently due to an infection in my salivary gland, dry mouth, dry eyes and then some joint pain. She had a large panel of blood work done. My SSA antibody, ANA and CNP tests all came back positive. I have an appointment with a rheumatologist on 7/3. I have a slew of other health issues that have been blown off by many doctors over the years that I'm starting to think might be attributed to Sjogren's. I have Interstitial Cystitis (been on Elmiron for years and that seems to help), breathing issues (they couldn't find anything wrong years ago but did zero blood work), intestinal problems (cut out gluten and it helps A LOT) as well as some fertility issues that I am being treated for by a reproductive endocrinologist."

What I want to know is what happens next? What will the rheumatologist do? How much should I tell them about all of these other issues? I'm really scared about the positive ANA as my primary doc said this could be attributed to the Sjogren's or another autoimmune disease. Is anyone familiar with this particular lab result?

I'm just feeling pretty overwhelmed. I received this diagnosis (or part of one) while in the process of a fertility treatment cycle as well as settling on our first home in a month. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
"It's never lupus.  Season 5, Episode 5.  It's called 'Lucky Thirteen'.  I haven't had a chance to see it yet.  It looks like Hulu has removed full episodes of House from their service.  I'll comment when I find a copy of it available."
"Currently, my fiancé is on a Plaquenil and Meloxicam regimen and I have found that most of the drugs have some pretty nasty side effects.  What have you found to be the most helpful?  Are there any holistic treatments that are worth anything at all?  Any particular exercise?  Anything, really.  I just want to see what your experiences are with treatment and what has afforded you any modicum of relief.  Opiates are off the table for us because they don't really kill the pain and we don't allow them in our house.  Thank you in advance for any helpful tips.  Oh, I forgot to mention, if you know of any cutting edge research please let me know because I have inside access to the pharmaceutical industry and I can possibly be pointed to the right people who are doing the research, but first I need to know what that particular research is specifically."
What products have you tried that you love or hate or maybe you're just indifferent about to help you deal with Sjögren's? Is there anything new you are trying out?


What do you do to protect yourself from the sun? Do you react to the sun with or without medication? What is your favorite sunscreen?  Any other ideas? Also would weekly discussion thread or daily ones work best?
"I had the vast majority of my symptoms hit me simultaneously.  The symptoms that I noticed, at least.  When I had my first hospitalization, I was told that I had an A1C of 9.7.  I was an insulin dependent diabetic.  No more than six weeks earlier, my A1C was below 7.  I had been considered borderline diabetic for a number of years. But, this came as a big surprise.  So far, doctors haven't been able to give me an explanation as to why things changed so drastically and so quickly, other than ""sometimes these things happen""."

Anyone else have a similar experience?  Is diabetes something that's common with Sjogren's?
"I was diagnosed with Primary Sjogren's last September.  My Secondary Sjogren's came back negative.  From what I've been reading, it's Secondary that has all of the symptoms associated with it.  My neurologist is thinking that, based upon the results of my bloodwork, that lupus might be what's causing many of my issues.  I'm in the process of looking for a new reumo.  I'm wondering if he's onto something..."

"edit:  Found a copy of my bloodwork results.  I have SECONDARY Sjogren's.  The only thing that came up positive was my ANA and my SS-B.  If I had lupus or scleroderma, I should have had at least something else pop up.  I was diagnosed with fibro a couple of years ago.  Maybe I just have a hardcore case of Sjogren's.  LOL  I need a new reumo."

"Cevimeline (Evoxac) is consistently $150+ per 30 days for me, even with insurance."

"GoodRx sometimes has deals where I can get it cheaper, but not always, and it's not super convenient to move my prescription around to whichever place has it cheaper this month."

Anyone know of any coupons or workarounds or legit prescription savings things that cover it?
"When my mouth and throat becomes dry and I try to drink water to help it, it hurts and seems to dry it out even more. I have tried different types of water, different types of bottles, and various dry mouth mints, gum, and mouthwash— none of which help at all. Does anyone else experience this?"
Has anyone had punctal plugs?? What was your experience with them? I’m seeing an eye surgeon tomorrow to discuss the possibility of getting them but I really know nothing about the procedure/outcome.
Has anyone taken cevimeline while pregnant?

"Hey everyone, I am not diagnosed with Sjogren's as my blood didn't show an antibodies, but I think that I have it because over the past year I have been suffering with a dry mouth and eyes. Recently I have been having tingling in my groin and left leg/foot and it's driving me insane. It's only when I sit down and rest, and gets better when I put my foot up or walk. I have an appointment upcoming with a neurologist but will this tingling ever go away or are the nerves damaged forever?"
Has anyone done LASIK or know if it can be safely done?
"I've struggled with face dryness and red bumps on my face for about 15 years now. It started in my T-zone and spread to my cheeks, then to my temples and finally to my forehead right up to my hairline."

This is just one of my symptoms but I want to focus on it this year and see what I can do to improve my facial care. Here's what I've tried:

"- Eucerin face care: Increased reddening, shiny redness; stopped after 2 days because I had to be in public. I think of it as a face explosion."
"- Lotions: A friend who sells cosmetics told me she had the ""perfect"" gentle cream that was meant for this kind of thing. It came in a 1 oz. tube and cost me $54. I put it on and it made my face explode into shiny raised bumps. I've had similar results with other lotions. I had to stop using it because I looked like a redness racoon and I had to go to meetings and things."
"- Exfoliating. The dryness seems to create a need to exfoliate so I don't have dry bits all over my face. However I've always struggled with this because as soon as I exfoliate, the redness really shows. But, unlike with lotions, exfoliating gently and with water seems to result in an extra redness that doesn't last _as_ long, so I can do this at night and wake up with just my normal dots & redness."

"Does anybody have recommendations? Should I have stuck with the lotions for longer? Does the shininess go away? I get good results with moisturizing my hands, which have always been very dry. I'm thinking of trying a bit of moisturizing oil at bedtime, next, using a dabbing motion to apply it."

"My hope is not only to _not_ have these face explosions, but to reduce my normal amount of redness and red dotting."

Thanks for any feedback.

"P.S. Diet-wise you guys know the story. I feel like I've tried everything. Tried a no-sugar diet, then did no dairy, went gluten-free for years, and finally tried AIP after my gluten sensitivity subsided. None of the above seemed to have any impact on my sjogren's symptoms."
Hey all. 32/F diagnosed with sjogrens via lip biopsy in '16.

Current bloodwork is showing elevated CK levels (in 600's) and low IG levels. Anyone else have these issues?
Anyone tried low dose naltrexone ? What did u notice?
As long as I can think I had long periods where I was not thirsty at all. Think hiking up a mountain at over 30C heat and only drinking because I feel my body getting weak. On the other hand there's always been shorter periods where I had an unstillable thirst and literally dreamed of the guy selling ice-cold beer in a sand desert.

"There's been periods where my body doesn't seem to hold onto electrolytes and I end up with irregular heartbeat, acting up muscles, cramps, pins and needles, waking up in the morning with cramped up hand positions and aching joints. Pills tend to stick to my oesophagus. Over the past few years I have to pee every night even if I worked out in the evening and had the last cup of tea 3 hours before going to bed. And there have been shorter periods where I'd suddenly pee like crazy, lose 800gr of (water) weight from one morning to the other and all those symptoms are magnified, with very low blood pressure, constant coughing, potentially with shortness of breath and loss of near-sightedness. It seems my eye pressure drops when this happens. There are other periods where I suddenly get confused, memory loss, weak, tunnel vision, endlessly hungry, just stare ahead and by now I know that having salt stops this. Otherwise it goes on for 4-5 days, with some temporal improvements after dinner. Likewise, salt seems to stop the excessive thirst. There've also been periods where I literally longed for salt and licked the salt off crisps or did even crazier things."

"So far all blood tests have been ok apart from constantly low albumin, and low most electrolytes at one point or another. There might have been signs of a mild acidosis (low bicarbonate) during two particularly bad fluid losses with shortness of breath."

"Dry pretty much everything, depending on how dehydrated I am. Mouth is mostly ok, eyes can be dry especially in the morning. Very dry fingers, often constipated and very dry stools. During bad flare-ups capillaries sometimes burst. Possibly some kind of connective tissue issue: somewhat flexible, but mainly too much very stretchy skin on hands, feet, face, hypermobile feet bones/ankles and hands, and I can scratch my little finger joint with the thumb of the same hand."

Family: my sister has problems with bones staying in place of many joints/her spine. Both sister and mother various autoimmune disorders. Me: hashimotos and pernicious anemia.

"Annoyingly I have yet to see any specialist doctor as just low albumin and various low electrolytes isn't enough to let me see one. Nothing else was ever found, but not much was ever tested. Living in new country now, thus lets try again. The reason I'm going to see a gp is because my vision went from -0.25/-0.5 to -0.75/-1 and +1/at times impossible to correct within 4 years, since this became more acute."

Anyone recognise this? How do I go about my new GP with this? It just seems such a complex issue.
"I live in the US and I've been on Xiidra for about two months. I also take Systane Ultra easily 10+ times a day. There's been some improvement, but not enough to be comfortable throughout the day."

I've been having a dry mouth for more than a year. Eyes are slightly dry. I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's around a month ago so it could be symptoms of it.

&#x200B;

Going to the rheumatologist tomorrow but wanted to know what I should ask for.
"I have had morbidly dry, gritty, sometimes red eyes for years. I don't have a diagnosis of anything, as I'm a bit doctor-adverse here. I haven't even been to the ophthalmologist for them, although often they are so dry I use artificial tears all day long, otherwise I can't see very well; it's a blur."

"In April, I developed a very tenacious eyelid twitch, for no apparent reason. It won't stop and sometimes involves the entire side of my face, so, I googled it, along with the unspeakably bad fatigue I've been having too, and it sure sounds like I have Sjogrens."

"I have had my thyroid removed, but my blood levels are fine, I have also had my parathyroids removed, but my calcium is in range, and when these drop, I know it. I have either diabetes or pre-diabetes too, which is what I thought might be causing the dry eyes, as it causes thirst."

"My dentist mentioned my teeth were suddenly covered with odd cavities along the gum line, in the fronts, and he didn't know what to make of it, asking me if I had been tested for Sjogrens. I didn't think much of it then, and said no, I had not."

"I have also been diagnosed with moderate gastroparesis, for no known reason. That involved many painful tests."

"It is all always chalked up to ""anxiety"" since I have a documented anxiety disorder that has nothing to do with health anxiety or being nervous and is more like ""Fear of taking the subway."" This concept is too complex sometimes for doctors and nuance though."

"The doctor I have now is really hard to get an appointment with. I got in and tried to ask him about my eye twitch, but he brushed it off, and I mentioned that I had blurry vision, but he said that was from being pre-diabetic. I asked him about my fatigue, and he said, ""You must be stressed out"" (no, I'm mainly retired, with a steady source of income, I work for pleasure a tiny bit, and I don't drink coffee, exercise when I can, and sleep a ton, thanks to medication that I take for my anxiety disorder -- I'm quite relaxed and enjoy my life very much, except for the part where I am in my body, feeling terrible)."

"I also have a very dry mouth and keep water with me all the time. For years. I've also lost my libido. My blood pressure is low as well, often 90/50 now. F, mid-40's, 19 BMI, family history of the diabetes."

"What should I be doing better to advocate for myself, or is there a particular test I can ask for, and does it have to be through a PCP or can it be through an ophthalmologist, who would be easier to get an appointment with?"

Thank you for your help!

"Hi,"

I was diagnosed with migraine associated vertigo last year in addition to my Sjogren's. Does anyone else have this issue? I have been down a rabbit hole of different treatments and have just now learned how to cope with it when it flares up every few weeks. My rheumy doesn't know much about the connections between Sjogren's and migraine/ vertigo.

"So far I am working with a chiropractor, have modified my diet (no caffeine, no alcohol), and am on gabapentin/ yasmin/ plaquenil. I have heard birth control can make it worse but found that my migraines always came on my placebo week. I also have PCOS, which contraindicates my coming off the pill as I am at high risk for endometriosis and other complications."

Now I seem to be able to work through it and be able to drive/ barely function but I am exhausted and off all day. Any tips? I saw a headache hat on amazon and am not sure if it's worth it or if any of you have tips/ tricks.

Thanks in advance.
"I get very dry mouth, especially when I go to bed.  My Dr wants me to try  Salagen or Evoxac.  I tried neutrasal which just a rinse, and did nothing.  I am on a beta blocker and shows up as a med that the dry mouth meds can interact with in a bad way relating to hear conduction.  I also have burning tongue syndrome which start after I had Thrush.  Anyone here use these meds, and what was the result?  Thanks!"
(Sorry long post please read)

"So I definitely have sjogrens, was diagnosed years ago and it runs in the family.  I read that it can cause pain."

"I have had severe bone pain since I was 4 (that's almost 25 years). I don't mean joints or muscles, I mean bones.  First was my right tibia,  it suddenly felt like it had been snapped in half. It has spread to every long bone in my body, and started hitting the small bones like my fingers and feet, and even my cheek bones too. Sometimes it's a sensation of cracking in half, or being twisted until breaking like you do with uncooked spaghetti noodles, or ice pick, or just like a semi truck ran me over or sometimes it's like the bone marrow was replaced with lava, often it feels like the trauma is being repeated, like the sadistic semi truck driver is running me over,  backing over me, and going again all day. It is constant and transient, I always have at least 1 bone in agony, but it can be all affected bones at once too, and 1 minute it might be the right tibia, the next second it's the left forearm. I hurt equally whether I'm running a marathon or laying in bed resting, heat/cold therapy has no effect  diet doesn't matter, no pattern has emerged at all."

"I have had x-rays, head MRI and CT scans, excessive blood and urine tests, and nothing has been found.  No past or present Damage indicated in the bones, nothing.  It's gotten more intense over the years, to the point where I take gabapentin AND  strong narcotics just to function every day."

Does anyone else have similar problems? By what mechanism does sjogrens cause musculoskeletal pain anyway?
"Hello,"

"Was anyone here diagnosed via the SJO blood test?  If so, how much did the test cost and how much did insurance cover?  Did you have traditional blood tests prior to the SJO test and were they negative?"

"I had an appointment with my optometrist yesterday who ordered this test because of my severe dry eyes.  I had a blood test a year ago to check my SSA and SSB antibodies but it was negative, along with my RA factor, but the more I go on the more I think I have Sjogrens."

"I have severe dry eye, gastrointestinal issues (bloating, pain, constipation), celiac disease and occasional joint pain and I am hoping the SJO test might show if I have Sjogrens because this is getting unbearable for me.  I highly suspect auto-immune due to the celiac as well as family history of autoimmune."

Thanks.
"Hey guys, I stumbled here after so long of feeling not all too good. M/23."
"I always attributed my dry eyes and dry mouth to smoking, however now I really notice how dry my mouth is after having quit smoking for a month (about 2 years 1 pack a day till 1 month ago). Just want to know your opinions on my symptoms:"

"For long time, about 4 years now, Ive been on and off (very) dry eyes. Like tearing all day until I got oculotect. Also the sandy feeling I feel so similiar with. Also yellow/green fluid stuck in the eyes? Still have bit dry eyes after not smoking, but no more sandy eyeburns, use oculotect only when waking up."

"Also, I drink a lot of water. I need at least 0.3-0.5 litre before I go to bed to satisfy my mouth. Sleep quite bad, always feel tired when I wake up."

Another thing is my fatigue. I sort of have bursts of fatigue? Mostly at 15:00-16:00 or after lunch I just want to lay in bed and really have to lay dwn. Goes hand in hand with very dry mouth.

For the rest I do not really feel muscle pain or in joints. Not noticably.  Also had eczema sinds  birth basically. Since I quit smoking way less redness in face but still a little bit. And stretch marks everywhere even though I gained just 6 kgs.

"Except for my eyes everything seems mild compared to you guys, so I wonder if this could be it. Have had all this for past years at least.  Just attributed it all to smoking but that only seemed to worsen the symptons since I still got them."

Thx a lot!

"Last 2 years I have lost A LOT of adipose tissue in arms, head, legs."
My hands look like an 80 year old's
"I am a 26 y/o man, diagnosed with Sjögren’s five years ago. I manage Sjögren’s with Plaquenil, but have had to cease using anti-inflammatories due to interactions with other medications I take. My most pressing presenting symptoms are dry mouth, dry eyes, fatigue, and most troublesome, rheumatic pain in my hands, feet, knees, and shoulders."

"I attempt to be active, and would consider myself to be in “fair” physical health. I have been much less motivated to go to the gym regularly lately, though, because I’m finding that routines that used to work for me are causing me too much pain to sustain an effective number of repetitions and sets. I am wondering if anyone out there has experience with gym routines and Sjögren’s, or just staying physically active in general while managing the disorder."

"Ideally 3-4 times a week, I try to do ~30 minutes of cardio (elliptical, stair stepper, jump-roping seem to be the most doable), and like to do moderate strength training and toning (usually using cables/machines, as free weights often cause too much pain in my hands). My fitness goals are fairly modest— I’m not looking to bulk up into a body builder or anything, just trying to stay in shape, keep my heart healthy, and ward off the fatigue that often follows sustained periods of inactivity."

"I’ve tried consulting my rheumatologist (who is never very interested in answering my questions), as well as personal trainers at my gym (who have been incredibly responsive and compassionate, but just don’t know enough about the disorder to really help). Is there some resource I might be missing (physical therapist?), or does this just come down to trial and error?"

"I’d appreciate any anecdotal help, advice, or resources. I’ve found this group to be really helpful and appreciate the information I’ve found here."
"Hi, I need suggestions to help with dry eye. I feel like I want to keep my eyes closed all day. They hurt and I can't look as far right and left as I once could without pain. Do you have a great eye drop brand or other suggestion?"
"I have Hashi's, Graves' (total thyroidectomy, both in remission, no antibodies), celiac (also remission, no antibodies with strict gluten-free diet), but probably had Sjogren's from the start 40 years ago. Just now getting diagnosed."

"I am having a hell of a time tolerating Plaquenil, but I really want it to work. I'm on the generic, but the name brand is WAY out of my price range, and my insurance won't cover it."

"The worst of it is nausea and migraine. Who in here has dealt with those symptoms as a result of starting Plaquenil? Will these symptoms end? I'm so tired of feeling like this, but I really want to give it a fair chance of working."

"I also am on 5 mg Flexeril at bedtime, 10 mg Lexapro, 65 mg Naturethroid, 75 mcg levothyroxine, 10 mg atenolol x2 daily, 5 mg Flexeril and 4.5 mg. low-dose naltrexone at bedtime. I take 4g  fish oil, 2 standardized turmeric capsules (for curcumin), 5,000 mcg methyl B12, 30,000 IU vitamin D2."

"I'm drinking a ginger decoction for nausea; it helps, but doesn't stop the dizziness. Which is probably what's making me nauseated."

"My question is, did any of you find out anything or help get diagnosed from an eye exam?"
Is this a sjögren's thing? My gp had some bloodtests done and they all came back negative. Not sure what to do now. Anyone else experience this?
I highly doubt I want to try plaquenil now after reading about some of the side effects on here but I'm am curious...

thank you.
"My teeth health declined rapidly in 3 months despite good care. Lots of grey spots, white spots, and some holes. Areas around my gums hurt. My gums are inflamed."

I need serious help with this and will try to get to the dentist as soon as possible. Are my teeth going to fall out in a year? I am 24!!!
"SO (26F) is feeling a little overwhelmed and doesn't know what to ask. Specifically, she is concerned about risks during pregnancy as we're hoping to have a baby in ther next 1-2 years. She is also fearful of drug side effects and is hoping to abound them if at all possible. Any help thinking up questions is greatly appreciated."
"Hi All,"

"I'm a 24 year old female and I'm still waiting for my rheumatologist appointment - but am fairly certain I'll be diagnosed with at least Sjogrens Syndrome if not also something else. I work in a freelance industry where employer insurance is rare and I'm currently on my parents' insurance. I fall into that middle class gap where I make too much to qualify for medicaid, but not enough to pay around $400-500 a month in insurance plus a high deductible. i'm genuinely scared of what will happen when I turn 26."

"Will my health insurance be higher because of my autoimmune disease? Can insurances refuse to accept me because of my preexisting condition? Many of my friends are opting out of insurance because we're ""young and healthy"" but with an autoimmune disease I don't feel healthy. It might be my only option if I can't afford insurance. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm looking into joining a union, but because I'm young I might not be experienced enough and have no idea if the insurance cost will be comparable anyway."

"I'm in the US, in case that wasn't evident by the lack of universal coverage."

Thanks for any advice or stories about your dealings with handling insurance with Sjogrens.

"Has anyone here gotten laser eye surgery? I really want to get it, but my ophthalmologist says that I might have really painful dry eye for the rest of my life if I do."


"I had an app suggested to me a few days ago to help remind me to drink water, but I'm not loving it. Does anyone have one they like?"
Have you been able to find a supportive dentist? Have you found anything that works particularly well for you?



Has anyone tried this?  Supposed to help w autoimmune problems?

I have been following Dr. Goldner's protocol for a week now and I am feeling much better. I wanted to share her here in case she can help more people.
She had Lupus for 12 years and has healed herself with nutrition. Take a look at her YouTube channel also.

Her book describes her protocol.

Hope this can help someone out there.
"Im 36 and I had sjogrens for the past year, eye symptoms verified by my optometrist five months ago.  A seperate primary care doctor Blood test showed extreme loss of vitamin deficiency that included low iron. I took centrums daily, lots of water but no effect. Constant burning eyes, fatigue, and dry cotton mouth daily, and mysterious blisters on my feet and palms. A couple of months ago i had inguinal hernia (laproscopic) surgery.  The doc said i had ALOT of intestinal scarring down there. I had bloating, constipation, and trouble burping and bloating."

"Two months later, one day i pushed really really hard in an upwards motion against the pelvic bottom of my intestines ( with my right hand against the right side) hard against the belly skin (2 inches below my belly button) and i could feel my bottom intestines come free from a lower pelvic pocket of muscle. It made a loud squishy gas sound. The Sjogrens disappeared, and constipation as well."

"I realized my Sjogrens was caused by a lower intestinal constriction on that right side right above the pelvic bone. I had loosened it!! My skin psoriasis dissappeared and no more dry mouth/eyes, and chronic fatigue is gone!"

Sjogrens free ever since.
Hope this helps you out.


Also:
I pushed about 2-3 inches lower (and more left as facing the pic) than the guy in the pic.

"Also:  if Sjogrens goes away, it can come back, especially if you strain on toilet, do heavy lifting, or sneeze hard too often.  had to push the intestines up again so it doesnt get stuck caught in the pelvic muscle. Ischemia of intestines caused mine too."

You could have been writing about ME!  I too have the same thoughts all day everyday.
"Not yet diagnosed either, going for lip biopsy in May but I have every symptom.  For a week I've had a total body itchy rash.  Maybe it's dry skin, maybe I'm having seasonal allergies, well you obviously know the drill."
Sometimes I wonder if I'm in denial about having an auto immune disease or maybe I'm a hypochondriac.
The thoughts are endless as are the many symptoms.  I wish you the best on your journey and maybe someday we can accept it for what it is.
"This is also my story, 27 years of rationalizing around symptoms. This group has helped in a priceless way."

"That also seems to be the ""nature"" of people, especially older people. They think they're helping you ""figure it out"" and they think they understand the way your body feels. I assure you, they don't. However- we do! We got you and you've got you."
"From the age of 6 I've had all the symptoms of Sjogren's with none of the answers. I hurt, I was congested, I had random joint collapse, I was tired all the time to the point were staying awake in school was very difficult and I was thirsty, so fucking thirsty **ALL THE TIME**"

But all I heard was

*stop being lazy*

*you're just doing it for the attention*

*can't you think up new excuses not to do chores?*

"*oh boo hoo you hurt, everyone hurts*"

"and a lot of other less kind things from my parents. At the age of 21 I was diagnosed that's 15 years of suffering with this shit and now my family likes to act like all the shit they said never happened, like they've always been there to support me without delay."

"I'm fucking pissed at how two-faced they've been about all this but I'm glad I have validation for how I feel now, something they can't disregard and I'm also glad I can finally get help."
"The worst is getting these comment from doctors, who are supposed to be helping you.  If you get brushed off, try to find somebody else who will listen."

Even with a diagnosis and medication you'll still have bad days and frustrating symptoms. Just remember:

You're not crazy.
You're not alone.
There are answers.
"We all hope you get them, and the tools you need to feel better."



Best of luck.
"This is me. Sometimes I convince myself that it’s all in my head until I hit another flare...then I’m like...oh yeah, no, this is definitely happening haha. I finally have a referral to a rheumatologist because some tests came back positive. My reg doctor still doesn’t think there’s anything wrong but said he’d refer me since things were “slightly” elevated and I was complaining of symptoms."
"Invisible illnesses suck - for all the reasons you describe. It's like until we are shuttling along with a walker and have to go in for infusions, nobody wants to take it seriously."

"But, I have learned to be completely unapologetic about how I feel and what I need. Can't make your BBQ because I am suddenly fatigued? That's right. They'll get over it, but I wouldn't if I forced myself to go and got sick for a week."

"Prioritize yourself, do what makes you feel better, enjoy every real and placebo effect you can get, and show the middle finger to anybody who makes you feel even worse than you already do."
"Good lord I feel this to my core! Before being diagnosed, I had seen eye doctors who told me my dry eyes were due to my makeup, ENTs telling me my repeat sinus issues were a newly developed seasonal allergy, and dentists telling me I MUST have started drinking sugary drinks or eating more candy to have caused new cavities. I hated feeling like I was always having issues, even embarrassed to mention that anything was ever wrong as its just not like me to always be tired, sick, and needing yet another doctors appointment. I even had another eye doctor write “Extreme Anxiety” all over my patient notes after I developed iritis and asked her if it was possible it could be connected to other issues I had been having around that time."
"It feels good to finally have answers, but knowing what I know now, I was handing these doctors some of the most common symptoms of Sjogrens on a platter. As common as it is, it seems like it should be more on these doctors’ radars."
This was me for almost 20 years. Along with a mis diagnosis of lupus.

All I can say is fight. If a doc doesnt believe you print out research or find another one.


"But yes, my family, friends and even myself."


You. Are. Not. Crazy.

I promise.
"For me, this all started about six months ago. With each passing week it seems like a new horrible symptom presents itself."

"...and with each new symptom the response from physicians was more and more, ""You're on WebMD too much,"" or ""I actually went to medical school."" (I don't actually use WebMD.)"

Now I just keep the new symptoms to myself because as they are less and less likely to take me seriously. I actually question whether or not I'm mentally broken and this is all in my head.

"So yeah, gaslighting seems like an appropriate description."
I hope your road only gets easier!
Thank you! It's crazy how much that validation means :)
"I'm sorry your family can't see your pain. Mine doesn't either... though admittedly, I've always felt this need to hide my suffering from everyone around me. So I wouldn't be a bother. But that's a lonely existence full of suffering. I don't wish it on anyone."
Thank you for your kind words. I'll remember :)
"That's generally the vibe I get from all doctors. I'm still searching for the unicorn who will look at my full list of symptoms and not only what they want to see, who will listen to me, and most importantly who will have a gameplan and not just a ""we can try this I suppose"" attitude."
Keep trying. That's all I do too. I suggested Sjogren's to my PCP and she said she could write me a referral to see an endocrinologist. I had to inform her that a rheumatologist might be better.
"I don't expect every doctor to know everything... but it sure seems like I'm way more informed sometimes. I tell my PCP that Google is my medical school. I know it's not a real medical school, but it's the best I've got. And though I'd never tell her this, sometimes I know more than her."
"If you think you're sick, keep fighting until someone believes you. Because you are sick."
I would put a warning on the xylitol that it may cause digestive issues. This is an awesome list! Thank you for posting! I wonder if we could get it stickied or put in the side bar.
My eye lids and under eyes get overly dry because of my ‘acid tears’. I use coconut oil for moisture.
Since people with an autoimmune disease can develop a sudden allergy to artificial sugar I now have to watch what I use. Sadly I'm one of those that developed the allergy and mine locks up my throat.
With this said I use Burt's Bees lip products. I love their chapstick and lip crayons.
For mouth I use Xylimelts which is a patch like thing that sticks to the roof of my mouth at night.
I use Systane Ultra for my eyes. It is actually what my eye doctor gave me and said it's better than the prescription for extreme dry eyes.
I find that IcyHot works better for my joints and muscles but I have RA and osteoarthritis also.
They make an epsom salt lotion that you can use for the days you can't soak or it make it to the tub.
Also my dentist said an electric toothbrush is better for those of us with Sjogren's cause it cleans better. Don't quote me as I only have 9 teeth left so my brushing is very quick. Lol.
I think that's all.  Having a brain fog day along with loads of fatigue.
Does anyone have problems with constipation? Higher water consumption helps? Thank you!
Biotin supplements or biotin shampoo/conditioner.

Started using it after I noticed some thinning hair on plaquenil. (Though can't say for certain it's all the medication's doing because I've bleached and colored my hair constantly over the past couple years)
"Does anyone have more info on what they do for dry lungs? Humidity doesn't quite cut it and I haven't found the inhaler I've tried to be very helpful. Admittedly, the inhaler is someone else's. A friend gave me her extra one :)"
I'm not sure if my breathing problems are even symptoms of sjogren's or something else. Just trying everything really.
You are 100%! I also use sugar free gum to help dry mouth.
Thank you for posting.  Is dryness and discoloration of the face related to Sjogrens?  I have a dry lightened patchy spot that itches at times.  I have tried vaseline but will try your ideas also.
Do the pain relief lotions actually work? I used to use liniment oil in my horse riding days and never had much luck.
I'd say well ripened bananas. A banana a day keeps the digestive issues with Sjogrens away.
Also use Evening Primrose oil tablets as a pessary to keep all the Sjogrens related issues at bay. Dunno if anyone else does this but it seems to work well for me.
No word on dry lady bits? C'mon now....

"From myself, I can recommend this. Have been using it for a few days now, *nothing* has helped until I got this cream. It stains underwear as it's yellow but I'll take it over the awful dryness any day."

& No problem 😃
"High water consumption and I would also recommend supplementing with magnesium - I use Natural Calm which is a powder you put in your drink. Also try logging your food for a while and see if anything seems to trigger it more often. I won't get too into the dietary woo, but I do think there is something to be said about certain foods being aggravating to autoimmune sufferers. Maybe not the same list for everyone, but some foods do things to me that others don't. Worth a look."
"I’ve started using biotin for hair loss too. Don’t take plaquenil, tried it some years go and got a massive rash"
I don't unfortunately! My PCP thought I was making it up and I forgot to ask my rheumy about it. PCP did some lung scans and then just prescribed an Albuterol inhaler since I was having a little bit of trouble breathing along with it.

Sleeping with a cool mist humidifier pointed at my face all night helps too but you're right it's not really enough.

I hope someone else chimes in
Added 😃
"Dryness of the face (and skin anywhere) definitely is, and I think this ends up causing some discoloration, for me it's redness."

Some of our meds can cause hyperpigmentation (plaquenil) but I'm not sure about a lightened patch.

I am going to a dermatologist tomorrow and need to ask anyway so I will let you know what they say.

I added a few more lotions I forgot to the list that I really like
"They can for more mild/achy stuff, but I admit it could very well be a placebo or the tingling from the mint/menthol distracting from a very mild pain. The lotion I use has many of the same ingredients as the menthol Salonpas patches, so I use them when I don't want to go the full lidocaine route (I try not to overdo anything)."
Cherry jolly ranchers are stashed at work and home. Apple if I can't find the all cherry bag. Love them!
"Also, when your mouth is beyond dry, xylitol products can leave chemical burns on your oral tissue. Use with caution if your case is severe. Biotene products are completely ineffective at that point, also. Don't ask me how I know. :/"

"Peach juice from canned peaches, though, is similarly slimy like saliva. Amazingly comforting."
"Also, maybe a category for salivary stones and using tart candies to draw them out and hot compresses for the pain? I haven't had this issue but I get from here and facebook it is a common problem for us."
Thank you!
"Can you contact your rheumy's office through their patient portal? Your rheumy should be made aware of this, shouldn't s/he?"
Thank you.  I have found that Burts Bees almond and milk hand cream helps a lot with the dryness too plus smells wonderful.   Good luck at the dermatologist 🙂
Thanks!
Added 😃
"good point, I keep forgetting the portals exist 😅"
Sorry I had forgotten to come back to this! I think my dermatologist was overworked/not very thorough. He wasn't able to give me any answers on this (said it was KP when it very obviously isn't). sorry.

"I will say that what has worked for my arms and face with the weird discoloration, super dryness, itchiness, and sometimes what appear to be hives or some kind of acne is Eucerin (the ""rich"" formula) mixed with CeraVe about 2-3 times per week, regular CeraVe twice a day, and occasionally using aloe vera gel (yeah that green after sun stuff). I also replaced all my bath products with sulfate free paraben free dye free etc. (as ""natural"" as I could afford) stuff. I quite like Renpure's tea tree and mint shower gel and my arms are as cleared up as they've been in about 4 years since I started using that instead of whatever smelled good."
Sorry your appt didn't go well it is so frustrating when you spend that kind of money on a specialist and they act that way.  What is KP?

I used to get rashes on my arms and the sun aggravated it.  Now i bathe in sunscreen and wear rash guard shirts.  I use paraben free shampoo & i lather down after shower with Johnson baby oil gel and it seems to do the trick.   The burts bees hand cream has helped my face but still discolored 😪.  I don't like that but luckily found a contour stick to darken it up. 🙂.  I will try the CeraVe / Eucerin mix too though.  Thank you for the update!
The lack of understanding by your patents/in-laws of what you are going through and have gone through is a big deal. It may affect every other relationship you have. I found that it overshadowed so many choices I've made about the kind of people I bring into my life and for what reason. It can be a lot to unpack.

"I'm so glad, though,  that you have your dx! Between 30-50% of us are undiagnosed, so you have something of a leg up in that regard."

Please check in and let us know how you are doing!

Hopefully this works.  Thank you for the info.

Perfect!  Thank you.
The comments are always the best part of The NY Times.  I used to spend hours each week reading them.  Now I spend hours on Reddit with occasional visits to the NYT.
Good bot
I love this article! Do you have any suggestions for a brand of mascara for people with sjogrens?
"This is so awesome! I love good eyeliner so much, and if it flakes or wears off easily, it’s such a disappointment."

"I’ve had pretty good luck with Stila waterproof liquid eyeliner as well. I hoarded samples of Lancôme eyemakup remover forever because it was expensive, but nothing else budged my my eyeliner and mascara. I finally got a big bottle during Sephora’s last sale."
"I sure do - I am going to write a post about that, too, but you can skip the wait (it might take me awhile, lol) and here are my two top picks:"
Burt's Bees Nourishing Mascara (budget)
"Wander Beauty Mile High Club Mascara (more expensive, but amazing)"
100% Pure Mascara (also good)
"Yes, I love the samples, too. I also really love buying makeup during the Christmas sales when they do the gift sets for a fraction of the price. Stila is another really good one!"
If there's any other makeup type questions you'd like answered - let me know! I'll add them to my list of future posts.
Thank you for posting & sharing this! I've been looking for a good mascara for dry eyes!
Where can I find a good long-wear moisturizing lipstick that won't wreck havoc on my lips. I love wearing lipstick but it dries out my lips like crazy :(
"Yay, I'm so glad it helped you!"
https://lipsbynic.com/colors/
"I second this! I prefer Bite because I need it to be gluten free due to other autoimmune issues, but I would love to find a new one that doesn’t tear my lips up. I kind of don’t believe it exists!"
"I agree. There are some great ones that have come out recently. The one by Burt's Bees is shockingly nourishing and good - and so affordable! Honest Beauty just came out with one, too!"
Silk eyemask keeps air off my eyes at night.
"My dentist did her dissertation or whatever they have to do on autoimmune disorders and how they affect the mouth, with sjogren's being a large part of her study I got really lucky. She recommended sugar free gum that has xylitol in it. Tbh most mouth rinses are xylitol. But immediately, long lasting relief and saliva production. Pur or spry are the best I've found"
Thanks so much for sharing this! Will have to try it!
"If you get a mouth guard, make sure you keep it clean, and/or replace it often. My Sjogrens mouth decides that getting Oral Thrush infections repeatedly is super awesome. 😒"
Thank you for sharing! It’s easy to forget about it but crazy what it affects.
"Make sure and take with vitamin K2! Most of the new supplements have added it, but if you have one that doesn’t have it added yet you can take a separate K. Without the k, vitamin d can sometimes calcify in your joints. Most people get enough K from their diet, but better safe than sorry. If you think you may have enough K naturally, do a few days of Cronometer and see how much you may be getting from your diet. D and K also help with the absorption of Cal/Mag."
I upped to 5000 of d and it has made such a difference for me!  Really helped the brain fog and mental clarity!
"My last blood tests showed that my vitamin D levels were too high, which was very odd. The only reason I can think for it was that I was taking too high dosages of it in the form of a pill. So one should also be careful with supplements."
"Did you have it checked before supplementing? My levels started out at 12, and after a few years of supplementing with 5,000 are still only at 50. My doctor wants me between 60 and 100."
"Fascinating and important info,  much appreciated OP, thank you!!"
"Thank you for the link on acidosis. I have an undiagnosed autoimmune condition. In my teens, I have severe weakness/paralysis on and off for a solid year. Theu noticed the low potassium levels when I went to the ER."

Thank you for passing this on.
Thank you very much for this post. I hope you have a great day.
"No problem! I am very worried about potassium levels, I intake next to none (picky eater) and take some meds that meds with potassium. I have had the weakness... I described it at the time as a ""dead spot"" in my strength; trying to lift something I would hit a point in the arc where I felt like I couldn't do anything and only momentum was getting me through to where I had control again."
"I would like to see it not necessarily just from a fitness and weight loss standpoint, but like, different treatments that just help in small ways. And showing how not everything works and how even the best treatments still leave you with bad days."
I'd be all for that.

Something that actually highlights what Sjogrens/RA/Hashimoto's/Fibro etc actually need to do nutritionally and physically. Because it admittedly all brings it's own unique challenge.
Great idea!!!
"I'd almost be willing to be on a reality show with one if those sad backstory segments showing all the crap from my 37 years with various illnesses, a million doctor visits, and all the self doubt as long as they put me in touch with real medical professionals who are interested, invested, and committed to my health at the end of it all. :)"
Yes! I feel like sometimes I get so into something and then the crash comes and if I’m working with a trainer or a gym buddy and it’s like oh you failed you can’t do this too.
Yessss. We do far too much self testing and research. To see someone with more knowledge put their focus on it would be so interesting and helpful
Sammmmeeeee
"Unless I apply quality, moisturizing lip balm constantly, yes."
"Yes. Lip masque at night, I like laneige,  and gentle sugar scrub before lipstick application and sometimes midday."
"Yes, always, as long as I can remember. No lipstick for me!"
"Yes, this is a constant for me. I can sometimes get a day of relief from applying lip moisturizer regularly, but the next day I will have it peeling again. I would love to know if anyone figures out a solution to this!"
Yep. It started when I was in my teens. Before bed I apply a thick layer of carmex and in the morning the dry skin peels right off.
"Yes, and the corners of my mouth have been cracking as well. It’s almost like the part of the lip that becomes mouth (weird description, I know) gets sensitive as well and swell up a bit, and that peels, too."

"I use the Neutrogena lip balm, which is great, but nothing works 💯. I keep these lip balms EVERYWHERE, just ordered another dozen from Amazon."
not my lips but my dose drys out and the skin on my nose peels off so it looks like i always have a booger
"I use muciprocin, aquaphor and lip balm"
Yes. I use coconut oil.
"Also a yes for me.  Since as long as i can remember (30+years). I apply Lucas' Papaw Ointment - it's Australian (like me), and is truly the only thing that works to keep my lips moist. I always have a small tube in my bag, by my bed, on my desk etc."
Thank you
"The tests seem to let a lot of people down. I was once told that any clinical test only gave you a picture of the second that the test was taken. Also that everyone's ""normal"" is different. Here in Scotland I've only had a blood test, the levels were such that my Rheumatologist confirmed the diagnosis from that & a consultation."
Let me just say that medical doctors should never assume hypochondria if only because they have no training to do so. And the emotional harms it does to a patient who is suffering is immense.
"I finally got my diagnosis after having my eyes checked for damage. There was a lot of damage, which I didn't know, as I don't even wear glasses. But I have had the symptoms for a decade, and my grandma had the same thing. So, you'd think the hereditary mention would be a flag for most docs. I was really unlucky, I guess."
"Tbh I have had doctors say that I might have Mancheusens, etc. There can be a serious lack of empathy in the medical field, it’s very sad."
It's fucking scary to be so sick and to be spoken to like that. It can fuck with your trust in ways you can't  predict.
"Exactly. There’s been points in time, since then, where every time I have symptoms I doubt myself. I will take pictures or screenshots (for heart rate issues) for everything that happens because now I have this ridiculous paranoia that any doctor I meet will think I’m crazy instead of just listening to me."
"I sweat like crazy too, yet still have dry skin myself."

"I was told that anxiety can do that. I’m more of an anxious gal, so I figure everything’s related so that too is a either side effect or curse to everything else."
Yes I have that. Especially worse when I take pilocarpine. Supposed to stimulate saliva and tears makes me nauseous and hot and sweaty. Have to take zofran sometimes I’m thinks of trying the other one. But the sweating is awful.
"I sweat like crazy, and their best guess is it's the Lexapro. I don't take the other medications you mentioned."
"I have Sjogren's and I sweat a lot!  For me I don't think they are related. Thinking back, I was a big sweater before coming down with any autoimmune problems.  The pilocarpine made it so much worse, that I just stopped using it. I make due with lots of water, gum, etc."
"My doctor says Sjögrens can cause autoimmune neuropathy ( small fiber neuropathy) and that causes dysautonomia (sweat, poor temperature regulation)."
I have super intense allover flushing and sweating that happens every few hours 24/7 that I’ve chalked up to one of the many the autonomic symptoms I have along with small fiber neuropathy.
I do too. It's a using other functioning sweat glands to get your body out. It's another condition as well. The sjogrens has affected my hormones as well. Might want to get them checked.
"i originally sweat a lot, after i got sjogren's i sweat twice as much. it's crazy haha. i hate it! i wear gym clothes a lot and try to stay out of the sun at work."
"I've given away all of my turtlenecks, sweaters, and big winter coats. I pour sweat at the drop of a hat, but I think it's due to Cymbalta."
"I thought I was going insane at first, but just out of nowhere my feet have become cartoonishly sweaty."
"I live in an extremely hot climate, so I drink tons of fluids and hide in my home most of the year. I have been treated for heat exhaustion many times, something as simple as getting gas during the heat of the day can have serious consequences."

"If I work out, it has to be in an air conditioned space. I can’t do yard work if I don’t want to end up in the hospital. It’s a real problem. I’ve considered moving to a colder climate. I can deal with cold so easily. 35 degrees in a t-shirt is okay for about 20 mins. 80 degrees in a t-shirt for 15 minutes gets risky."
"I’ve not been diagnosed with anything yet, but this is just one of many symptoms that seem to all fall under autonomic functions. I have already gone through peri menopause and had a period of hot flashes and these feel very different. I feel like I’m about to die when these happen. I try not to describe them as “hot flashes” because it seems like when you are a lady of a certain age and mention them they are instantly disregarded. Sorry you have them too. 24 hours a day?"
"I can’t sweat when I need to, like when it’s hot outside. However, I will sweat buckets before my period and only the night before it starts. Otherwise, dry as a bone."
"I’ve sweat so much all of my life. Now, my eyes and mouth are bone dry but the rest of my body will drip in sweat. I don’t understand it."
"My anxiety stems from sweating like crazy! I agree about the side effect or curse. Unfortunately anytime I see any doctor, they mention that whatever problem I come in with could be separate from the disease, but it could also be related."
"Same here. I've split the pilocarpine in half so I wouldn't be too much of a walking puddle of sweat, but the nausea gets to me pretty bad. Is the other option cevimeline HCl? I've just read that another user here is using it. I was never offered another option other than pilocarpine."
"that's interesting, i'm on that too for almost 2 years now and maybe that's why it increased since then."
Shucks. Did you sweat a lot before you started taking medication? I'm not taking that medication and sweat like crazy.
"I feel like my Sjogren's triggered the excessive sweating! Because really, I never sweat this bad anywhere except my armpits until I got sick and diagnosed."
"Might want to look into trying Evoxac or its generic, Cevemeline, instead."
I'm going to look into this! It's like Sjogren's has opened the floodgates of all my sweat glands and it's getting out of hand.
"How did you get diagnosed with this? I have the flushing in my face often. I call them hot flashes but it's nice to know there's actually something I can tell my MD without him looking at me sideways if I say ""hot flashes"""
"Great suggestion! I'm not currently taking any medications other than the occasional Pilocarpine, so I guess it's safe to say if anything abnormal shows hormonally, it isn't an effect of any medication."
"This is me exactly!! Gym clothes, only black leggings because if not then my sweat stains will show. When they said it was a ""drying"" disease, I questioned their diagnosis in a heart beat 😅"
Are you taking Cymbalta primarily for Sjogren's? My rheumatologist recommended that for me for my chronic chest pain and fatigue. I don't suffer from anxiety or depression but I said I needed a little kick to my step with my energy. It feels like I have the flu all the time.
Same for the back of my knees. Who the heck sweats behind their knees?! Have you any remedy for it? Or have you just been soaking in wet socks all day?
Lucky duck in my opinion! I find that better than sweating all the time. It is horrible sweating in winter time 😑 Have you found anything to help with the dryness?
"Same, docs can be clear as mud sometimes."
"I take cevimeline. I really like it and have not noticed any nausea or negative side effects from taking it (and I’m usually really sensitive to side effects from medication.) You can’t really cut them because they are a capsule rather than a tablet. I sweat a little more on the cevimeline, but I wouldn’t say it’s a remarkable difference. The moisture mostly goes to my eyes and mouth."
"Not to this extent. But I also started taking Lexapro shortly before my Sjogren's diagnosis when all of these weird symptoms popped up, so who knows?"
"I’ve not been diagnosed with anything yet, but this is just one of many symptoms that seem to all fall under autonomic functions that is going haywire now. I have already gone through peri menopause and had a period of hot flashes and these feel very different. I feel like I’m about to die when these happen. I try not to describe them as “hot flashes” because it seems like when you are a lady of a certain age and mention them they are instantly disregarded. Sorry you have them too. 24 hours a day?"
"Mine gave it to me for pain associated with RA, but I also hit the genetic lottery with Sjogrens AND, just recently, gout."

"I have had a history of severe depression in my late teens through 30’s, but have been fine for years, so I also couldn’t see what benefit Cymbalta could have. But it rocked my world! I had more energy than I had in a long time. Recently it decreased because my kidneys are crapping out, but I have hope I can get there again!"
Damp socks and lots of sandals. Back of the knee sweat is....weird as hell and you have my deepest sympathies 😂
Did your MD recommend cevimeline first or was pilocarpine an option for you too?
"I'm sorry to hear that. I had Raynaud's Syndrome slapped on me to pair with my Sjogren's. Are you taking other medications for the disease along with Cymbalta? I'm currently doing the natural thing as much as I can and only take Pilocarpine from time to time for my dry mouth, but the fatigue is really getting to me. Nervous to see how my body is going to react to it. I'm aware that we're all different, but did you have a good experience when you first started taking it?"

I work in the Psych department so I've seen the worst of people having a bad reaction to medication.
"My rheumy mentioned both during my appointment but said he suggested cevimeline. I didn’t know the difference so I went with his recommendation. He said it would take several days/weeks before I would notice a difference, but I had more moisture in my eyes and mouth within about 20-30 minutes after taking my first dose. I was so overjoyed I wanted to cry tears of happiness, but I conserved my newly found tears ;)"

"I still focus on drinking *lots* of water every day, but I’m not so thirsty that I’m drinking gallons and having to use the bathroom constantly. It’s been an amazing meditation for me, one of the only prescriptions I can say that about in my entire life"
I’m on Cevimeline and it makes me so nauseous I vomit. It’s the only one I’ve been prescribed
Oh no! That’s terrible. I hope they can find an alternative that will work well for you. In the meantime have you found any relief from the dryness?
Yes so I’m so bummed it makes me so nauseous because it worked for me right away. But I’m sure there is something else I can find
"I don't know if it's Sjogren's-related but I could have written your message. I get very frustrated with myself when I'm at the height of brain fog. And I've spent the last year or so, off and on, feeling like reality has no consequences. Like you said - like you're living in a movie."
"I have a feeling it's autoimmune flair up related, but I think it might be a generalized thing and not specific to Sjogren's. Of course, no doctors I've met know enough about autoimmune to help me confirm any of that."
[deleted]
Sorry about the dx but glad you found this group. I read an article about depression and autoimmune disorders so I bet they are linked. I would check out sjogrens.org for more information and additional support. Hugs
Sorry to hear about it. :-(

> I forget things really easily and I feel a bit like I'm just kind of living in a movie at times.

"I'm curious, are you pretty good at imagining things? How about envisioning possible future outcomes? There are a number of us here with Sjogrens who are ""intuitives"" and we naturally struggle with memory, though we are extremely capable in meta-cognition (seeing the movie from the outside), as well as other really important gifts."

"As an intuitive myself, one of the biggest tips for help with depression and anxiety has been to understand my own psychology and use it to make the most of what I've got. This has helped reduce my Sjogrens symptoms drastically."

"Hope you'll hang in there, there are lots of possibilities for improved health even for people with Sjogrens."
I could have written your post almost word for word. I go through the same things but I never thought it had to do with Sjogrens or Lupus (I have both) but now I think maybe it does seeing as so many people experience the same things.
"I get immense brain fog when I’m ‘off’. For me, I find if I eat close to a Paleo diet, it helps my symptoms.  No grains, dairy and limited sugar helps with my mind and my mood. This sub really has great ideas and suggestions. Welcome and you’re not alone!"
Yes lots won’t be “proven” to work until we try it. I’m not waiting for “science” to catch up. Medicine as it is today is designed to keep us sick
And yes ur symptoms sound more neurological. So consider seeing an autonomic neurologist . There are not many of these labs in the USA but hopefully u are near one. Most regular neurologists dont have equipment needed to properly test you.
I think I have Sjögren’s also due to physical symptoms but I feel exactly like you have described in this post also. Has there been any improvements in this or should I expect to stay like this forever?
"Brutal, right? I can handle the physical symptoms.. but the cognitive issues have been plaguing me for about 7 years which I've had to take medication for."

"I know that I was already an anxious person, but something struck during that time that took it to another level and those types of symptoms."

Is brain fog a common occurrence with this disease?

Thanks for the response! I hope to get some more answers at my next appointment.
I’ve been in this for 10 years it helps my symptoms but hasn’t stopped progression. It’s amazing how for some diet fixes everything. I wish I was one of them
I'll have to check that out.. but it looks promising!
Thank you! I appreciate it!
"You just completely made me cry out of relief. I have brain fog to the maximum, but I’ve always been HEAVILY intuitive/imaginative and see things people don’t(not hallucinations lol), but the memory and what I’ve thought was a variant of dissociation; the whole reality has no consequences and is a movie deal. For years pre diagnosis it was all chalked up to ADHD and bipolar. But neither of those explain my problems. Thank you so much for putting this in words. ❤️"
"It helps knowing that there's others. I don't feel so alone with it. I know I've always been prone to anxiety, but I've gone through such lengths to take care of myself it made me crazy that I never felt any better. This explains a lot."

Things will get better!
Thank you Luna! I appreciate it. I'll have to look into ways around grains.
"Do you have any ideas? Sorry, I'm so new to all of this."
I'll look into it!
"I think that you have to treat the two separately. As of now, I haven't started any medication to treat the physical symptoms - I just try to exercise and eat decent."

The mental part is difficult.. I really think that a good medication and counseling could make all the difference. It's just finding that balance.

"Sorry I responded in wrong thread , 🤪 but yes here is what I’m doing. Autoimmune paleo diet def helps reduce symptoms but for me is not enough. I had high copper levels and no zinc so I’m balancing that for life. Copper alone can cause autoimmunity. Rule out any active infections like Sibo Lyme or mycoplasmas all stealthy pathogens that can cause autoimmune reactions and focus on gut healing. Say no to sugar grains dairy maybe even lectins. Reintroduce slowly overtime if u want and are having no reactions. Research low dose naltrexone for me it has been amazingly helpful and I’ve only just started. Research transcutaneous nerve stimulation there has been numerous studies done for RA and. Small one for sjogrens but it seems to be a big help for controlling symptoms without drugs. Get your autonomic and nervous system checked bc if it’s attacking that u may wish to use ivig instead of the chemo type options. I have been approved but haven’t started yet. That’s all I have today. Glad u know now and hopefully soon U can feel better."
Oh I see I thought u were just following diet. Some people do have clearance of all symptoms with simple dietary changes. But they are the few fortunate ones
Thank you for all of the info! I think the diet will be huge.
"Only started listening to your podcast a few weeks ago but I'm incredibly grateful for it, keep up the great work :)"
We are happy to hear you are enjoying it.
"If you would like us to discuss anything in particular, please let us know!"
"Sjogren’s is a systemic, whole-body disease. Muscle pain/stiffness is a symptom of it. My doc recommended B complex vitamin but also stretching, Pilates, or yoga."
Those symptoms are exactly how I’d describe my pain and face during a flare.
We are still in the early stages and no positive Sjogren’s diagnosis for one of our children. They describe a very similar set of symptoms and pain/soreness predominantly in legs. We have been told that it is likely Sjogren’s with chronic pain due to immune response. The puzzling part is that there is no clear immune response according to lab work or biopsies.
"I had a really great rheumatologist who was reluctant to make a connection between my neuropathy, 'fibro-type pain' and Sjorgren's. 🤷‍♀️"

Sjorgren's is not well researched/understood (especially in people who aren't very elderly women) and its often secondary to other issues... its not unusual at all to find it difficult to see our problems holistically.
"I agree! My blood tests don’t show anything horrible but I feel like everything has gone haywire.  I’ll randomly feel like I have a sunburn when I haven’t been in the sun, break out in rashes for no reason, painful dry eyes so I have to add drops several times an hour, near permanent sore throat, exhausted all the time, everything aches, and worst of all, extreme vertigo/dizziness/headaches. This is the strangest disease ever!"
"I’d love to know the mechanism of why it effects things systemically is I guess what I’m saying... I have always tested low for B in my blood tests, even with supplements, I’ve been trying a new ‘activated’ B this past year, so I’ll be interest to see if it makes a difference to my results, but it certainly hasn’t made a difference to anything else. Exercise thankfully has always been a massive part of my life, but again I’ve not found any impacts other than psychological. But psychological impacts are good at least!"
How terrible for your child. I hope you can have some answers (and relief for your child) soon!
"I think it may be because it causes an inflammatory response in the body as an autoimmune condition, but I'm not sure. It's super frustrating to have so many seemingly unrelated issues. I saw my rheumatologist again today, and every time I go, I have something new to ask/address with few solutions offered."
I have been taking it for years and I love it. Makes a HUGE difference in my nasal and mouth dryness.
Thank you I’m going to look into this!!
It seems we can benefit in more than one way from sea buckthorn oil:
[Oral Sea Buckthorn Oil Attenuates Tear Film Osmolarity and Symptoms in Individuals with Dry Eye](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/140/8/1462/4600377)
Thanks so much. I’m so dry it’s crazy. I’ll look into it for sure.
"I just started taking it for vaginal dryness...we’ll see if it helps! I sure hope so. Mouth and eye dryness have been easier for me to treat than that. I’ve basically stopped having sex, because it’s a huge chore and requires a TON of lubrication and is still painful with that. Sorry, TMI haha. If the sea buckthorn helps even a little, that’ll be great."

Eta: This is the one I’m taking. I hope it’s the right kind!

"Sea Buckthorn Oil Blend, Omega-7 100% Organic Vegan Capsule, 120 Softgels https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RYNY2CM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_-dWyDb0SGC10C"
That sounds very interesting.
n=116

"I would caution generalizing a study this small, though if there's no adverse side effects to Sea Buckthorn oil, I don't see a reason why not."
"I tried it and did not see any improvement, don’t remember the dosage and frequency unfortunately. I did it for about three months. The grain of salt to take from my experience is that it’s difficult for me to distinguish if my pain/discomfort is from my Sjogren’s or small fiber neuropathy."
[deleted]
I tried this for well why not. I got it the next day and have been using it once daily a dropped full. Too small to know if I’m using the right dose. Lol. I noticed I haven’t had to use my rostasis for 3 days now. I’m out so had no choice. This is a miracle for me. No more itching eyes. And I’m seeing better at night. Thanks so much. I’ll keep spreading the word.
"You’re one of the few people that have mentioned nasal dryness as a symptom in SS.   It doesn’t get much attention in publications.  I live in an extremely humid climate and that helps some, but winters are maddening.  Doing nasal saline rinses to stave off sinus infections gets old.  I may look into this."
That's great to hear. Can't wait to order it once I'm done with my testing.

What's your daily dose? I've read that it can be pricey but some comments say they get a relief at just 1 or 2 capsules per day.
thanks for your information regarding nasal dryness. I'll put this stuff on my amazon wishlist now :)
"You could look into some moisturizers for postmenopausal women. I see Replens MD mentioned here and there, it adheres to the walls of the vagina and works for up to 3 days. There are other products like that from other companies. I have this problem myself however I haven't tried them yet.

"I just got this a few days ago and it's amazing. No lubricant has helped me this much. It contains Sea Buckthorn oil too, among other things. You can't use it with condoms though, just a heads up. Oil can damage latex. For everyday use it's really great though."

"From my own experience I can say that my nose got much better from 2 grams of omega 3 but it takes time, I think I took it for 2 months before seeing proper results and with some supplements I heard people say it takes 3 or more. So give it time.. I'm still working on my diet hoping I'd be able to solve this without too many supps, but we'll see."
"Like I wrote in the OP, the study I linked to was done on a different condition. It only mentions the results of the Sjogren's one."
"Yes I did see some comments about people having stomach issues, though I recall someone saying they had them from one product and were fine with another from a different company."
I take 2 in the morning 2 at night of Solaray's Sea Buckthorn 300mg capsules. I think I settled on it because it was the least expensive but still effective.
Thanks. Anything to help. I also have a vagicle and recityle surgery coming up. So it’s not just the dryness.
thanks
Same here! Wow. Glad I’m not the only one :)
"Same for me as well. I can't find any connection from any medical studies either, but PA is so rare and having both is probably even more rare so I doubt any studies can be done. Nice to see a couple others on here with it. It's been a rough ride but so much better with the shots. Now if I could stop the associated acne that'd be fantastic."
Might be worth looking at your meds. Some meds could affect your B12.
How did you find out you have PA? Did you have fatigue etc?
"Ugh, I got told I had CFS, fibromyalgia, all based on just talking to me, no testing was ever done until I pushed back and said you don't know what I have, you are sitting there throwing darts at me. And in the meantime, I'm suffering. Have you tried a good multivitamin? Or just taking extra b12? I know some people with PA have success with 1000mcg of b12 daily. Or just a good b complex? The only thing is taking those will skew b12 tests."
"My drs keep telling me, nope, no connection at all! Not possible! And then my when once monthly shot wore off within 2 weeks, I went in and complained, now I get my shot every 2 weeks and it has made a huge difference."
Pernicious Anemia is horrible in itself....
"I do get some good sized zits from my shot, almost like cysts. I dab retin A on them. I got sick, then sicker then even sicker, and my dr WOULD NOT test for b12, I knew it ran in my family, I was sick, my Sjogrens flared so bad, I couldn't eat for 8 mos, I choked on liquids even. I went from 179lbs to 94lbs in 8 mos. I was going I to bradycardia, my lips and fingers were blue, I couldn't barely breathe. That Dr kept saying it was menopause, anxiety and kept trying to throw xanax at me. Finally my uncle who is a Dr found out I was sick, he walked in looked in my mouth and said, its anemia, he set me up with a new gp, and when the got the b12 levels back they were 91, it's supposed to 300-500. Here, the old dr had tested the year before and it was 136, he knew and never followed up for some reason. The new Dr. was pissed! I was admitted to the hospital given IVS and oxygen"
"After 2 weeks of loading doses I could breath, I could eat. I could kind of move around, Then off to the neuro, I have nerve damage now too. Off the cardiologist I now have a small leaking heart valve I did not have before. The hematologist that worked on me in the hospital said that I would have died in probably another 2 months it nothing had been done. And I was in the ER constantly too, nobody did anything. It was surreal. And I went back and paid that old dr a visit to tell him thanks, he still insists it wasn't b12. And they normally won't give people b12 shots more than once a month, but I don't make past 2 weeks, and even with that, my numbers haven't up after 2 years, when they checked the highest it's been is 289 and that was taken 5 days after a shot! Lol! So the new dr. went to bat for me with the insurance company and now I just get 6 mos worth of vials at time & syringes and I can do it in my thigh, or my uncle does them in my arm, or I can go to my dr office and from what I understand they usually fight you on that. I was in such bad shape I don't think they want to mess with it."
"Yes, especially PPI'S.."
I definitely have PA. No intrinsic factor. That's why I have to have the shots. ☹
"It just kind of crept up, I was really tired, had unexplained nerve pain and tingling at first which can be lots of things, as it progressed it was shortness of breath, brain fog, trouble swallowing, then progressed to all over pain, and neuropathy and I couldn't even put shoes on, then I lost a ton of weight, smelled phantom smells, and and became paranoid and spacey. Finally low blood pressure low oxygen saturation, I went into bradycardia. Mine was an extremely bad case, or it got bad because I had some bad doctors, who kept saying it was anxiety. But the symptoms can be really vague and sneaky at first. And I knew it ran in my family, and we kept asking could it be PA, and kept getting to told because I was a 45 yr old woman it was menopause and anxiety. It's a simple, cheap blood test that I feel everyone should have done as part of a physical. I almost died and I'm not exaggerating. And it can in fact kill you. I've been on shots for 2 years now, and doing better, but I still suffer from the damage it did to my nerves, heart and brain. I have been told, I'm about as good as I'm going to get, and at 48 I never would have thought I would be like this or that a vitamin deficiency could do this much damage."
"God that's brutal. I get that it's a rare disease, but holy crap all it takes is a blood test. I had complained of extreme fatigue for years. They kept blaming it on depression. I know the difference. I started slurring my speech, having random bouts of weakness, every single symptom that you can get from PA, I had. They thought I had MS or narcolepsy, finally diagnosed by a neurologist. Permanent nerve damage as well. The thing I hate the most is the phantosmia, I smell smoke when there is none. It's a distinct smell though, not like real smoke, but I hate it. I have to do the shots every other week as well. I was doing them every week but my levels got too high. Lately my muscles have been freaking out and I'm not sure why. I'll slightly injure something and my muscles will spasm for days. I don't know if it might be another autoimmune disease."
"I have fatigue and joint pain and dry mouth and dry eyes. I got tested for serum B12, it was 110. Then I got alternate day injections for 10 days. Could it be B12 deficiency and I need more? I still have fatigue."
"Omg! I would ask everyone ""Do you smell that? Something is burning!"" What I got told about the b12 and the muscle cramps/spasms, was that it can come from the fact that b12 uses your potassium up, I know they watch my potassium, it does drop a bit with my shot, but it bounces back up. I just make sure to eat higher potassium foods and got told I could also a potassium supplement  the 2 days after my shot to off set it. But you have to be careful, potassium can screw with your heart I guess. Mine moves from 4.0/4.1 to 3.5/3.7 just after a shot, and that can cause the spasms."
"I did the loading doses like you, but standard is a b12 shot once every 4 weeks for life once they find b12 deficiency. I do my shots every 2 weeks because every 4 wasn't cutting it. 110 is really low, and I'm surprised they aren't following those loading doses up with at least monthly shots. I would ask your dr to clarify why they aren't doing that."
"And Sjogrens could be drying out your muscles and joints too, I woke up one morning and my leg at my hip, was stuck, when I rolled over my damn leg was stuck straight up. Lol! That took some prednisone to fix. And it hurt like hell. My shoulder and arm spasms too."
"I'm so glad I ran into you on reddit! Thank you so much. I've been trying to eat more chickpeas, I'm going to have to try harder to get more potassium."
"But is serum b12 reliable? Others in my office have same levels and don't have any symptoms. So you think if I week a shot once a month, my symptoms may resolve?"
"Me too! Lol! I eat sweet potatoes, mushrooms and cranberry juice. I'm looking for a chewable potassium, I cannot swollow this huge pills. Pedialyte has a powdered single serve drink mix that has a good shot of potassium, and not many people like it, but split pea soup has tons of potassium in it."
"They can do some other tests, I did a 24 hr urine test, and and MMA to determine circulating b12 test as well as an intrinsic factor antibody test. Standard rage for b12 is 250 to 800. They want to see it at 300-500. But I have found my bloodwork to be pretty accurate. I know my sister has low b12 from her diet, not true PA, and the have her just take 1000mcs of b12 a day and she said it has really helped. I am missing an enzyme, intrinsic factor, so taking it orally does not work for me. But, best thing to do is question your doctor before doing anything and make them run some tests to see why its low."
All things I love. Thanks so much!
"Not sure how much potassium you need, or if salt is compatible with it, but there's ""lite salt"" with the regular salt in most grocery stores that is half potassium and half salt. I put it on everything, even in my water. lol"
I dont know what to do now? Should I get MMA? Doctors don't think it's B12 as I have already taken shots
You are welcome! 🙂
"In my opinion, medical professionals don't take b12 or PA seriously. Before my doctors would would even consider that it was PA my doctor checked my thyroid, my vitamin D, they checked for diabetes, checked my heart, I had multiple MRI's, MRAS, nerve tests, swollow tests, upper and lower GI scopes, and we kept saying but PA is in my family, I paid for all those tests and went thru them, and honestly, that's fine, I know what I don't have now I guess, but a simple few blood tests would have done the job. My old dr to this day insists it's not the PA that caused my issues. My new gp, my neuro, and hematologist have all said well, he was and is completely wrong. And I know he's completely wrong. If a doctor won't go further, especially when a test came back at 110 and you had symptoms, and are still having them, it's time for a 2nd opinion or they need to do all the testing for it. But keep in mind, it could be other things as well, vitamin D deficiency can make you very tired as well. Sjogrens in itself can make you tired. Have they tested your b12 again?"

"I have Vitamin D deficiency as well (10) and I am taking weekly dose of 60000 units for it. They didnt test my B12 again, just told to take 10 injections. I am not sure I have SJogren's, I have dry eye, dry mouth, fatigue, joint pain. Doctors think it is fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. I don't know what to do, feeling hopeless."
"I know, it so hard when you don't feel good, and nobody can tell you why. Have you seen a rheumatologist?"
"This exact problem is why prednisone was sent from heaven to save us all. Your parotid glands are swollen and it hurts. I get it sooo bad, have ever since I was little. I remember docs telling me to 'suck on a lemon to break salivary stones loose!' there were no stones--just inflammation from this GD disease!"
"Yes, that is a pretty good description of me in the morning. There is never any sleeping in late because I’m so uncomfortable and stiff."
I feel that same thing every morning. Here in the Netherlands we don't get prednison prescribed for sjogren's. So painkillers and Plaquenil souls do it (which of course doesn't do the trick).

"In which way has prednison helped you guys? Did you stop feeling your heartbeat pounding in your parotid gland? No more redness from the inflammation of the glands? How long did the effect last, and which dosage did you receive?"
I'm really curious to know about this and maybe I can try to talk to my doctors again.. I really wish I wasn't in so much pain and something could help me :(
I just wake up with cotton mouth and eyes burning from the dryness sometimes. I’m lucky my condition is pretty stable lately *fingers crossed 🤞🏼
It is so painful some days. I hope you get some relief.
I just assume it's buildup of fluid in my sinuses
this happened to me this morning! started out like a migraine and just made its way into my jaw/teeth. I put a heating pad on my face and eventually it was bearable
"No, definitely not alone. I've noticed that sometimes if I smile or laugh too much in a day, my cheeks feel like someone punched them. Just big, puffy bruises. It's discouraging to feel like my body is not my own and has been taken over by an alien. But, then I hear stories of others who suffer with so much worse. Hang in there."
"I've done that once with an atomic fireball and my eyes and nose started watering down my face, it felt good!!! Do you think it's time for some Prednisone? I haven't been on any since mid October."
Same. Uncomfortable and stiff and I wake up and put my face over my cool mist humidifier to try to get some damn moisture.
They might if your symptoms are bad enough. I have Sjögren and also live in the Netherlands. My rheumatologist (very hesitantly) considered it as an option for me if my current med wouldn’t work out. Athough they’re very hesitant to prescribe it because it’s so bad for you (short term eg insomnia but long term organ damage).
"I mean, I am not your doc so I can't really advise, but when my glands flare up, I take 5-15mg per day for about two days then taper down. It's the only thing that works to calm them down."
"I sleep like that the whole night, otherwise it's unbearable. I also use oracoat Xylimelts during the night, which at least help a little bit with the dried out desert oral feeling."
"Really? Because they are considering removing of of my parotid glands because of the pain (which is quite a big operation with a lot of possible complications), but they keep telling me prednisone isn't going to help me :(."
"Are you also on plaquenil right now, or what kind of meds do you use? Also, can I ask in which hospital you are being treated?"
"I'm going to call him, it happened again today. My face is painful!"
I sent you a pm :)
Ask him for the pred!
It’s fucking horrible. I feel your pain. Only people with illnesses like these can understand just how hard surviving is. :(
Infected salivary and parotid glands has been my biggest issue since diagnosis. The whole right side of my face hurts. I feel your pain.
Have you tried Plaquenil?
Ugh. That’s horrible. When my saliva gets so thick I always say it’s like rubber cement. I know it’s gross but I can never spit so I have to wipe it out of my mouth with my finger or a tissue. Hang in there!
"Oh! Its horrible, mine get plugged and swell like a golf ball and hurt every time I eat. I have mine flushed out by my ent once or twice a year, and the pack them with steroids. It does help, but it just comes back. When she flushes them, she says it's like a gravel pit, there are stones and sludge in them and the ducts are all scarred up from the stones. One thing that helped was going with Biotene toothpaste."
Thank you <3
Thanks for sharing <3
"I haven't been prescribed any medication yet. Just saw the rheumatologist for the first time in June... have some tests to do, and then I see her again in September. Hopefully I'll get something then."
"I really sympathize with you, and understand the gravel pit analogy. I've never seen the biotene toothpaste, but I do use Colgate sensitive, and my mouth feels much better when I have it. It's hard to get the biotene rinse around here too, but I buy it when I can. I'm thinking I may have to order them online."
Plaquenil is your best chance at controlling it. Best of luck tolerating ut.
"I used to be able to buy it in the stores, but this last time I had to go on Amazon. It's getting harder to find."
Confirmed neuropathy from a nerve conduction study. I have reduced pressure and temperature sensitivity in my hands and feet.

"Sometimes my hands get overstimulated and textures that don't normally bother me will make my hands feel like there being scraped raw. I only handle things with rougher textures (like raw wood or stone) with gloves. Any kind of fiddly work will overstimulate my skin very quickly, as will UV exposure for longer than an hour or so (it depends, less if it's a particularly brutal day)."
"I have peripheral neuropathy. It’s the worst at my most distal points, i.e. finger tips and toes, and it’s worse on my left side. My neurologist believes it will venture more proximal as I get older (I’m 24). I fortunately do not have pain, but I do have loss of feeling and trouble distinguishing sharp and soft objects. My neurologist says it’s like I’m a normal person with very thick wool socks and gloves on. I still feel weight and temperatures and objects touching me, it’s just that they’re much more dull than a regular person would feel."
"This usually happens when I'm asleep, my fingers will start to tingle and become numb. Sometimes it happens to my hands as well, but definitely my fingers the majority of the time. And every great once in awhile my arm will stiffen up in the middle of the night and cause some pain. I wonder why it always happens to me when I'm asleep..."
I have autonomic and small fiber neuropathy all over confirmed with QSart and skin biopsy. What helps me greatly is compounded B complex and low dose naltrexone. Also acupuncture sauna anything to get circulation going helps pain. When pain is overtop which it’s not if in above I take kratom for pain. Only happens in winter off my b complex.
"I was just diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel last week. My hands get tingly a lot. Always at night, sometimes while I'm using them during the day. It's mild, so I'm supposed to be starting physical therapy as soon as I find a place to go. I'm (hopefully) coming to the end of a sjogren's flareup so I hope my hands get better as my body calms down but I don't actually know if it works that way. :)"
For me bcomplex helps the pain.
Most important is finding the cause of this and if it’s neuropathy. Get a skin biopsy. Get a through autoimmune panel and keep doing it. Get a lip biopsy. If it’s an autoimmune cause ivig can sometimes reverse neuropathy if u address quickly
I strongly dislike wooden cooking spoons for this reason.
My left foot is tingling right now and I don't know if it's because Sjogren's or not
I have terrible nerve prickly pain all over bit mostly in my legs.  2 of my GPs claim there's no such thing as a QSART test and that the NHS in the UK doesn't have it and nor do private.  It has ruined my life.  I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.  I've been told to not go near Neurotonin or Gagapentin.  I have no antibodies for Sjogrens and lip biopsy found only mild inflammation yet I have many symptoms of Sjogrens and so the private specialist calls it Sicca.
Can you help?
They may not have QSart I don’t know but I would imagine they would. Call these folks and ask them where u can go close to you if not then. https://www.hje.org.uk/services/autonomic-neurovascular-medicine-unit/ but if u have neuropathy a skin biopsy will also show this. But u need an autonomic specialist not some regular neurologist. Keep taking antibody tests especially during flare to see if something comes up  for sjogrens or another AI disease.
I don't understand this flare thing cos it's consistent for me.  It can lessen on waking up or when out of the shower (on in the shower).  I've had numerous blood tests which show nothing still.  My hair has also gone dry and brittle.  I get rashes too but they disappear quickly.  Right now my thighs are alive with prickling and I'm in bed.  Is there any medication?  It's weird cos last Saturday I was at an open air wedding and I had no  problem that day. I will check the link thank you.
Damn. I know it's rough. It might be a good idea to start logging your pain and fatigue in case you have to go on disability.

I'm so sorry you have to go through this. I was your age when I had to stop working. It's so fucked.
"Hey! I’m 27 and exactly the same. During the last eight years I’ve gone from a normally functioning human to someone who can only do about 5% of what I was used to able to do. Everyday is just a struggle with my body that seems to only want to fight against me. I feel your frustration. Not sure what we can do except to try to get more help, which is another struggle itself."
"I completely understand. I’m barely 21 and feel like I’m in my mid 30’s- early 40’s. I just returned to work about a week ago after being on Leave of Absence for 7 months and I’m just so incredibly tired already. I should be in my prime right now, but instead, I worry if I’ll have enough energy to make it through another work day or how much pain I’ll have to endure during said shift. But all we can do is our best. I highly recommend you don’t push yourself beyond your limits, because I did that and was forced to stay home for 7 months. Take a day or 2 off if you need it. Best of luck and keep on, fellow warrior! 👍🏽"
Join the club.  I’m a 28 year old male so I basically won the lottery with this disease.  I can’t stand it.  I just quit my job and am in the process of moving closer to my immediate family.  I was diagnosed when I was 26 and it has been all uphill from there.  I just want to feel normal.
"* hugs* I'm sorry :( I don't have any advice, just lots of support for you and what you are going through <3"
"I had a flare up on Xmas too. Got yelled at by my mom for taking a nap on the chair when people were here, but my hands were swollen and aching and I had unbearable fatigue. I’m 31. I, too wish I could work out and be normal. The last time I tried working out and doing squats, my left foot to the top of my calf went numb for about a month. It was terrible. I’m dealing with my hands going numb a lot and shooting pains in my arms. Swelling in my right foot. Tight shoes. The worst is trying to blink in the morning, my eyelids feel like sandpaper’s against my eyeballs. How did we end up this way! I take Plaquenil and my muscles aren’t as sore to the touch as they used to be. My shoulders and neck were the worst, hot to the touch. I lived in agony most of last year, I realized a connection between a severe headache, red eyes, fatigue and muscle soreness and weakness. I was down for about a month. I was so sick. Finally got a damn diagnosis. Turns out all these years there was an explanation for fibromyalgia. I’m relieved to know I wasn’t imagining it! Hang tight and know you are not alone! Prednisone is amazing, it saved my life during that last bad flare up, I was short of breath and all!"
Sorry to hear you are struggling. Have you tried plaquenil? I was on it for lupus before I was also diagnosed with Sjogren's and it helped a lot with the joint pain and fatigue.
I can't imagine not being able to work right now--I would quite possibly go insane. What did you wish you logged? Any suggestions for me? My super early onset makes me think I may have disability in my future.
I’m so sorry. Are you on any meds? When were you diagnosed?
"If you don’t mind me asking, what do you do for a job/career? I’m 34 and still haven’t figured out what I want to be when I “grow up” and with all my health issues ima till relying on my parents financially and it’s a huge blow to my self esteem and ego. I have a bachelors degree and started a graduate program in January but it was way too stressful and threw me into a really bad flare."
Welcome to our shitty club. Do you have a good rheumatologist?
"Thanks for the commiseration, I really appreciate it. :D"
"Man, I get the headaches too. I’m bringing it up finally at my next rheum appt. pressure, and vision flashes. I have to say plaquenil did nothing for me for years—imuran was a game changer though."
"What are the main symptoms of lupus that differ from just SS? I think I have lupus based on a very light rash over my cheeks and nose. Some days it’s worse, other days it’s lighter and less noticeable. But during my last severe Sjogrens flare when I got my diagnosis, i had what looked like a mild butterfly rash, it was warm and when I sweat it gets itchy."
"I’m only eating triptyl right now with a quite low dosage, 35 mg. I’m going to start eating LDN soon (if my doctor will allow, I’m gonna beg her to prescribe that) and kinda hoping for big boost from that. What about you? I was diagnosed only at the fall of 2016, but my severe symptoms started in the year 2011. No doctor took me seriously though because I was ”young and too good looking”. Ugh."
"I am a cashier at a convenience store. I’m actually on another “Leave of Absence” because of a flare up that caused a wound that just absolutely won’t heal and is so incredibly painful when I’m on my feet. Since I’ve left work again, I rely heavily on my family to support me financially. I completely understand the blow to your self esteem and ego. I feel like a burden and worthless. And I also have yet to figure out what I want to do when I “grow up”. It weighs heavy on my mind as to what I’m going to do for my career. Congrats on getting your bachelors btw! Hopefully you feel better and are able to return to the Graduate program and if not, you find a job that makes you happy and isn’t too hard on you. Best of luck!"
"No she is awful.  She asks no questions and spends the minimum amount of time with me possible.  She’s the one who diagnosed me so at least there is that, but I’m moving back home to KC in a few days so I’m going to do some research to find a better one.  I can only go up from here."
"I was having severe sensitivity to light, which made the headaches sooo much worse. I’ve had light sensitivity since I was a teenager and was diagnosed with Hashimotos hypothyroidism but I got so much worse. There were times I was sure I had an aneurysm. I noticed just recently a lot of that headache pain is actually coming from swollen lymph nodes in my neck, and swelling in my parotid gland, which sometimes makes the area near my temples feel bruised. I had what I thought was pink eye in both eyes that didn’t respond to antibiotic drops, I now realize it was Sjogrens and prednisone probably would of cleared it up! Twice that happened. Both times I had what they thought was pink eye was after extremely stressful events. Death of a loved one and then a custody battle. I’ve been using CBD for anxiety and it seems to be helping a few different things, noting was helping the pain in my fingers and hands from swelling and it helped so much."
"There is a lot of overlap between lupus and Sjogren's, but the butterfly rash that you describe is often telltale lupus. The first line of medication for both is usually plaquenil but Benlysta is specifically for lupus. The criteria for lupus diagnosis is here: https://www.lupus.org/resources/what-doctors-look-for-to-confirm-a-diagnosis"

"If you have one AI disorder, you are likely to have at least one other. I recommend taking pictures and keeping a log of your symptoms, tell your rheumy about all of them and request blood tests."
I was always “young and healthy and don’t worry about it” after being diagnosed at age 11. A dentist caught it actually. What is LDN! I’m not familiar.
"It took me years to find a good one after I turned 26 and lost my PPO. I'm now on an HMO, and many rheums simply don't take them. It's maddening."
LDN = low dose naltrexone
"I forget exactly what it is or does but I hear that many of those with autoimmune issues have success with it, all I know it’s that it partially binds to opiate receptors and modulates the immune system somehow."
I have Medicaid and it doesn’t cover jack shit as far as decent doctors go. And specialists? Don’t get me started...
"I just happened to listen to this episode today and really appreciated the information about what SSF does, and how. I had already used their clinical guidelines when discussing Sjogren’s with my opthamologist and dentist, and it helped me feel confident in my treatment choices. I am excited there are more clinical guidelines in the works! Hearing this episode made me decide to become a member of SSF and also become a donor. Thanks for the valuable interview."
Just listened this morning as well.  Trying to join currently.

Downloaded the doctor guidelines.  Shocked. To realize that trial and error over years has lead me to most of the recommendations.  Even not knowing what Sjögrens was.
Reminder to respond later. I'm ssa ssb positive since 12. 40s now. You will be ok.
"Keep moving. Exercise is so hard for me (36F, diagnosed 3 years ago, sick about 6 years), but I find if I don't do it, I am extra stiff."

"Get preservative free eye drops, and keep regular eye appointments."

See your dentist twice a year.

Make sure all your health care providers know about your diagnosis.

"Find a support system - friends, family, online."

"You will have bad days. I have many - - either where I just don't don't well, or where I am down because of this disease. But don't give up on the idea of happiness : I have a boyfriend, a job I enjoy, and good friends."
"I'm not exactly sure but as a 23 year old male who also won the lottery, lemme know if you figure any secrets out. For real the only thing I have found that helps me a bit is carrying around a gallon of water everywhere. I also don't have a GP either"
"Right away, ditch all the people who don't support your health. You do not have the energy for anyone, family or not, who doesn't make your life better by being in it. So many of us have been easy targets for people who are bad friends. Your major responsibility has to be to your health."
"It's a bit more than dry mouth but manageable. The good news is that because you know now you can manage it and hopefully avoid some of the complications like dental issues, that other people have had. See a rheumatologist, they know so much more than the average GP about Sjogren's. I like the Sjogren's Foundation for information [link](https://www.sjogrens.org/)."
FWIW I'm a male w/ Sjogren's too. There are more and more of us out there.
"try to stay out of the heat, but keep being active when you have the energy to! i was 19 (f) when i got diagnosed with ss and sle and already struggled with depression before. it can get really hard to deal with but you have to have a support system around you and make sure to keep up hobbies/passions that you already have. some things that have helped me are overnight xylimelts from amazon, biotene dry mouth products, hylo eye drops, lots of electrolyte drinks as well as water to keep from getting dehydrated. if you can get a doctor, ask to start plaquenil as it can be very helpful for lots of people with ss and other autoimmune stuff, while being one of the least harsh medications available to us. it’s helped me a lot with fatigue and dryness after 5 months of being on it. good luck to you!!"
"Am 20, I totally relate to feeling like the clock is ticking. I carry a water bottle everywhere I go. I use eyedrops when I feel the need to, or artificial saliva. I use coconut oil for my dry scalp and moisturiser for my dry skin. I've mostly cut out gluten and dairy. I also take several supplements; multivitamins, fish oil, probiotics daily. I feel better when I try stick to this routine, my only issue is finding time to exercise as I tend to get a lot of joint pain. If you're so concerned, find a rheumatologist and make a list of questions you have for them, and keep a close eye for any symptoms. They might suggest to get a blood test maybe once a year."

Hope this helps and try to stay positive!
"You can reverse or put yourself into remission by reducing the inflammation in your body. My GP gave me a regimen 5 years ago that one of her RA patients used to successfully reverse her condition, and I've been doing great on it. It does not have to progress. I think you would find that paleo or maybe even autoimmune protocol is the closest to what she gave me, plus exercise, meditation, reducing stress. I also added a couple things like sea buckthorn and fish oil supplements for my sicca symptoms. I can send you my write up if you want."

"Water is well and good but I found things like good fats like the ones I mentioned above but also avocados and coconut helped better, along with non-caffeinated teas and biotene toothpaste and mouthwash. /u/[cranbog](https://www.reddit.com/user/cranbog/)  started a great list here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cdlvps/sjogrens\_survival\_supplies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cdlvps/sjogrens_survival_supplies/)"
29 year old guy recently diagnosed but absolutely undiagnosed for years. Find a rheumatologist. Eat well. Exercise. You'll be fine mate!
Am a 51 year old male with primary Sjogren's.

"You've got your whole life ahead of you, and I know younger folks with Sjogrens who are living a full life, so hang in there ..."

"That said, this is a serious condition and you just can't do it without quality medical care. A good rheumatologist is crucial. I also see an opthalmologist for eye issues, and a neurologist to help with nerve pain I experience. But the rheumy is the one who deals with Sjogrens specifically."

"Your life *will* change, and you need to have realistic expectations. Joint and musculoskeletal pain is common for us. Use Biotene mouthwash and see if it helps. If your mouth is so dry you constantly drink water, it is pretty likely you will need to take medication at some point to promote saliva flow. You need to do some research on inflammation and how to change your diet to reduce it."

"Depression is a real issue with Sjogrens, and you can't ignore it. If you like your doctor, ask for a referral for a therapist to help with depression issues."

"[Sjogrensworld](https://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?board=1.0) is a good community for posting questions, and I post things there regularly. It really helped me when I was first diagnosed. (Handle is Gorn if you want to pm me.)"

"Lastly, there are promising medications specifically targeting Sjogrens that are in human trials as we speak. Things are probably going to get better for all of us within a few years. Don't despair."
28 male diagnosed first at 22 and then at 27.

To me it's really only about inflammation and reducing it.

"You have to find out what foods lessen your symptons and avoid those that increase it. You also have to take certain supplements that are truly vital in my opinion. B12, Vitamine D and Magnesium."

My situation:
"I personally went for a gluten free diet because I had symptons of gluten intolerance. Simply cutting out gluten (and (almost) cutting lactose) solved a lot of my issues in less than a week. I had to adjust my diet only partially. The replaced foods are more expensive but it surprisingly provides more nutrients (higher quality) so I eat less, throw away less, but don't really have hunger problems."

"Broccoli is a food I just simply must recommend. It works for me. It just makes my glands shrink and frees my flow of saliva. I've read from sjogren health advisors that it's a good food to eat that's why I did it, for me it works. I hope you will try it and find out if it does for you."

"Watch some youtube videos, read some documents from sjogrens scientists. The science is very progressed as to why things happen and what causes it from happening."
"Hang in there. I was in the same boat. A lot of the symptoms come and go, we just have to adjust our life by accepting what's been thrown at us right now."

"I was diagnosed a week before my 26th birthday, but my symptoms put me out for that whole year before figuring it out. Prior to diagnosis, I was a positive person, ridiculously active (I ran 7 miles a day minimum), and one day I felt like I had the flu and I've felt that way since. I felt like it was it for me, but slowly you pull yourself out of it and your attitude will start changing and you'll see that your body will follow. I didn't get the joint pain until a year after diagnosis, but luckily it comes and goes and there is medicine that had helped me through it. Just know that whatever gets thrown at you, there are treatments. I'm 27 now and currently have my disease attacking my lungs, and I can promise you, you will be ok. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here and we're all here going through the same thing."

I came here for support and seeing everyone give positive vibes though we are going through hell helps out a lot.
ok first drinking water doesnt do anything. You are not dehydrated your parotid glands are fucked.  This means your gp is a tool.  Use some artificial silva if you need something. Take good care of your teeth. stop eating meat/cheese it will reduce our crp which is an inflammation marker.  Take some 81mg asa and fish oil for a few months.
would really appreciate that! thank you
thanks for this. hoping for the best
And get a rheumatologist!
"Nordic Naturals. It's liquid and I like the lemon flavored one. I can put some in a smoothie easily. In a blueberry one, it is especially tasty."
I use Sundown Triple Omega 3-6-9 personally. It’s vegetarian which is important to me and flax seed based. No fishy burps! That brand does have a fairly cheap fish oil omega 3 only pill though.
"I do the Whole Foods brand fish oil. It doesn't make me burp; allegedly because it's not rancid. It makes a difference, but so did the rancid burpy kind."
I take the Costco brand krill oil.
"Aldi's (three a day). I also do sea buckthorn by solaray (four a day, two in the morning and two at night)."
BioGanix Ultra Omega 3. Two in the morning and two at night. Someone in this sub recently recommended TheraTears fish oil capsules which I might try when I run out of the BioGanix.
"Nordic Naturals. Honestly though, I think I feel better with just an EPA. I take Omega Via EPA before bed (this brand has worked better for me than the Nordic naturals epa) , and a nordic naturals liquid in the am which is a DHA/EPA mix. Sometimes I just take the omega via am and pm though, because it’s the one where I actually notice a difference in my mood etc. I know the DHA is important too, but I just don’t have as many noticeable effects from it. I also alternate between sea buckthorn, borage oil, and black currant in addition to the fish oil."
Nordic naturals ultimate omega.
Thank you guys!!!!
Second this!
Sweet!! I'll check that out!
I’m on Lyrica for nerve pain. I was tested by a neurologist too. I was also tested for MS. Neuropathy is a real problem.
Does everyone experience actual pain or is it numbness and tingling?
Indeed I do. It's very common and often is small fiber neuropathy. I'm on Lamictal and had to up my dose recently because the pain was spreading from just my hands and feet to just about everywhere and gaining in frequency and intensity. I hope you find relief soon.
"Yes, and I also take gabapentin to reduce it. I was up to 600 mg, but chose to reduce to 300 mg. It definitely helps, and I can't imagine functioning without it."
"I have actual pain and it hurts to be touched. I was told that it was fibromyalgia, which is common for people with other Autoimmune diseases."
"the first year i got diagnosed i had major nerve pain in my left arm, it was unbearable. i actually did therapy for it. it has since subsided. i couldn't work with that type of pain. thank God it hasn't returned. this was 2 years ago."
"Yes! I take Gabapentin, and it has literally saved my sanity by making me virtually pain free!"
"I have lots of neurological issues. It’s not really pain for me but feeling that bubbles are popping under my skin, an itchy feeling and that I’m vibrating."
"In my hands and feet, it comes and goes though."
"For me it’s tingling or pain, I’ve never had any numbness. It’s like small needle pinprick pain, I’ve also had some sharper pains from time to time in the cheeks"
[deleted]
"Thank you, it’s comforting to know the cause of the pain!"
I’m at 400 now but still have some issues. Any particular reason you choose to reduce?
"Wow, yes, spot on in what I am feeling. Did you do any tests that confirmed anything? I am getting those feelings in my face and upper lip now."
"The possible side effects aren't great, so I figure less is better if I can tolerate it. I also felt extra foggy on the higher dose(I take it at night)."
[deleted]
Are you diagnosed with Sjogren's? I have no diagnosis as my blood is negative
[deleted]
Yes they are very strange. So do you still have the pins and needles feeling? How do you treat it?
"Yes, this happens to me a lot. I try to carry my water bottle around with me everywhere I go, and I’ll also chew gum to help my throat not feel so hoarse when I speak. I’ll also gargle with warm salt water to help with healing. I’m not sure if that is recommended, it’s just something my mom had me do when I was younger and had a sore throat and it seemed to help then."
I would check for tonsil stones. They can cause sore throats and can be flushed out pretty easy.
I was having sore throat way before I got diagnosed it feels like it’s getting worse
My sore throat improved dramatically once I started taking Salagen. I haven't tried the other saliva-inducing drug yet but I hear it's also good. My main problem with it is that it doesn't last long enough. I'm seeing my rheumatologist in a couple of weeks and I'm going to ask about upping the dose. About an hour after I take it sometimes I can literally feel the saliva pouring into my mouth and it's wonderful! I didn't realize how dry my mouth was until it wasn't anymore. And that tricked down (so to speak) to my throat and it stopped being so sore all the time.
"I wouldn't say most of the time, but I do spend a lot of time fighting off a sore throat. Drinking a lot of water helps. I mean, a lot."
"Alllll the time. I gargle with biotene and try to drink a lot of water. I’ve started drinking rooibos tea with honey daily and that has really helped. The honey obliviously does a lot by coating the throat, but my friend in dental school told me that roobios tea should be recommended to sjogrens patients because it stimulates a healthy amount of saliva compared pharmaceutical saliva aids, and without the side effects. However, he said it can take up to 12 weeks of daily use to notice a difference. I noticed a difference after only 2 weeks."

Dryness can cause sore throats but consider looking into hypersensitivities; a lot of my symptoms that I’ve blamed on Sjogrens have turned out to be allergic responses. I especially noticed a difference in my throat after finding out I am allergic to sesame and cut it out of my diet. Allergies are weird and can cause sore throats like that.
Did illness start with sore throat for you?
"I think it started with dry eye lids about five years ago but I’ve had an onslaught of symptoms in the last six months which included having a sore throat 75% of the time. I had also just switched careers though, thought I would give teaching a go and was subbing in elementary classrooms. I went from working alone at my IT desk job all day, to standing and trying to speak to a group of kids who won’t listen all day. Not to mention the kiddos are all a bunch of little germ factories, so shitty immune system coupled with talking/raising my voice all day seemed to lead to a constant sore/dry throat, sinus issues, and fatigue. Being a teacher and having Sjogrens is proving to be a challenge! Ha!"
"As a teacher with Sjogrens, I definitely agree! It is so hard. Also my school is super old and is a dust factory so that makes things more difficult too."
"How do you cope?? Teach me your tricks! I am still going back to school for my teaching degree with a few months left to go, however subbing has made me feel like I made a horrible life choice since being diagnosed with sjogrens. Also, I drink a lot of water to help with my throat and bathroom breaks aren’t a thing! I’m afraid to mention anything to anyone for fear of being a “problem” if I ever want to work full time in these schools. One last question for you, I try to workout and eat right but I feel like I have no immune system anymore against these kids...does it get better??"
"Ask your doctor about prescription saliva production medication. There are two name brands, Salagen and Evoxac, with generics pilocarpine and cevimeline, respectively.  The Evoxac / cevimiline has been a game changer for me. Enables me to talk for work and socializing, prevents sore throats, is essential for exercising, makes eating easier and protects teeth."
"All of the other suggestions are great. As far as the immune system goes, I just take lots of vitamins and keep my hands clean. I also explain to my students about my issues and they are very accommodating (I teach high school). My school is really great about letting me take bathroom breaks when needed and my room is directly across from the restroom. Getting adequate (8-9 hrs a night for me) sleep is a game changer, too. Sour candies kept in my desk gets my glands to stop swelling so much sometimes."
"Where abouts are you? I can only comment on what might help here, West of Scotland. I'd suggest asking for an urgent appointment with your husbands Rheumatologist & also ask your GP for an appointment with a Dietitian. Ice-cream might be all your husband can swallow but it's not a healthy diet, have you tried liquidised soup? On the money side of things, here your husband would be entitled to PIP, Personal Independence Payments. I hope you manage to get some help."
"What about cold/frozen smoothies? It sounds like maybe the fat content of the ice cream may be what is helping his throat. However who knows what other effects the dairy and sugar may be having, they may be exacerbating his condition even if their topical effect is helping."

"Look up recipes for homemade “nice” cream, they are mostly frozen bananas and nut butter blended together, which would be more nutritious and still have a high fat content. Or if you want to skip the prep, smoothies with higher fat ingredients (avocado, nut butter, hempseeds) together with frozen fruit. These solutions do require a blender but it still may be less cost prohibitive or beneficial to his health. With smoothies you can add a bit of spinach, turmeric, other nutrient-dense or anti-inflammatory foods."

"ETA: with both these options you could add powdered xylitol, which would maybe help his throat/mouth with the dryness."
"This is so hard, I am so sorry it has come to this for you. It is not easy to live with someone that has so many significant and expensive health issues, and you are amazing for looking for a solution before throwing in the towel."

"I wish I had a perfect solution, but my Sjögren’s is not as advanced as his. When my throat sticks, I use special lozenges that keep your mouth and throat moistened, such as Xylimelts. I had to give up dairy and sugar because they were significantly contributing to my dryness. It is a huge lifestyle change, but I am following the Autoimmune Protocol, which has helped a great deal for my Sjögren’s symptoms. All this has helped along with a medication to increase saliva production, I take Cevimeline."

Is there a specific brand of ice cream that he eats? Maybe we can look at the ingredients and find out what thickener is in it that may be helping him?
"I don’t know that this will work for him and maybe you’ve tried it but I deal with the dryness too (not nearly as severe, it sounds) and I use a ton of Throat Comfort tea by Yogi. It coats your throat and tastes great. I use it allll the time when I’m sick or just dealing with my Sjogren’s bullshit. At the very least, it might be worth a shot."

"I’m so sorry you guys are dealing with this. Insurance and medical costs in the US are absurd. None of us can afford to get the care we need and we’re suffering, our families are suffering."
"Have you tried Thickit? Thickit.com it might be something you can use to make other pureed foods, vegetables for example the same thickness as the ice cream?"
"I would look at the ingredients in the ice cream and see if I could pinpoint what is working for him. It probably has a gum and/or emulsifier of some sort, that is holding the consistency for him to get it down. "

Commercial food thickeners are primarily maltodextrin and/or gums.

"Maltodextrin is marketed to bodybuilders as a way to take simple carbohydrates (high glycemic index) for fast-acting energy. It has a slightly sweet taste. Now Foods sells it as ""Carbo Gain"". Malto didn't work for my needs, but gums have."

"I primarily use xanthan, agar or guar on occasion. Psyllium will also gel, but I can't use it due to gastro issues."

"Here's my ""recipe"" (I don't have a Sjogren's Dx, just similarities); I make a rice and oatmeal porridge, thinned to a congee consistency and let it cool. I mix xanthan, oil, protein powder, and water and blenderize (I use a Ninja) it to a whipped consistency (the xanthan emulsifies the oil in the water and helps suspend the protein). I put some in the fridge and some in ice cube trays. When it's cold/frozen I use it with water to make a smoothie. I add anything else (veggies, fruit, flavoring, etc.) as tolerated."

There are YouTube videos illustrating ratios and methods on mixing gums.

I'm wishing the best for both of you!
Have you considered going on disability/Medicare for him? Maybe a feeding tube would help with nutrition. And chilled olive oil for throat lubrication.
My situation is similar to your husband's. My throat also sticks together. My uvula sticks to the roof of my mouth. I had saliva flow and volume tests done. My results were zero.

I eat a shit ton of ice cream. None of the medications to stimulate saliva have worked. Xylitol burns tf out of my oral tissues. I can't tolerate it at all. I wish that I had some answers.... for your husband or for myself. <3
"I'm not sure all that ice cream is good for him and I have no idea what, if any, other options he had."

"But, having to spend $300 a month for a serious chronic health problem isn't really that much.  Heck, I know people who spend that much on their beauty and hair routine."

"If he's eating that instead of regular food, isn't your grocery bill going down some?"

I don't know... it doesn't sit too well with me that a spouse is complaining because money is being spent because her husband has to eat something special because he's sick.

"Maybe you're looking for compassion, but, honestly, with out knowing more of the story, I just feel sorry for your husband."
Pardon my French but holy shit. I had no idea that Sjogren’s could get so bad. That poor guy. And poor you. Eating a gallon of ice cream every day would suck.

I have heard about a procedure where people get their throats stretched. I believe they do this at the Mayo Clinic. Have you ever been told about this?

I live in the US too so I hear you about health insurance... being sick SUCKS
"Saligen will help. Do you have a prescription for it? I’m so heartbroken, being a Sjögren’s patient myself, that a marriage is stressed to the breaking point. Prayers for you both."
"Yikes, not to mention how unhealthy eating so much ice cream is, and weight gain. Water with ice in it is cold down the throat, healthier and more affordable."

Has be been to an ENT doctor?
"Ok, let's all get real here and point out that sugar is a huge inflammatory ingredient.  Why the hell is he eating hundreds of grams of sugar just for the cold that he probably would'nt need if he wasn't inflaming the fuck out of himself with shit food?"

He can just as easily have ice cold water or veggies in a smoothie. But that much sugar?  Holy shit.

I'm floored. A gallon of ice cream because he thinks he needs it.  That's like drinking arsenic.

"Clean up his diet. Remove the sugar. Increase his foods that are anti inflammatory,  remove those that are.  Focus on all things anti inflammatory"
"Intermittent fasting, prolon, no sugar, exercise as tolerated, supplements that calm the immune system like curcumin."


Ice cream.... holy shit.
"Where I am is the problem. I'm in the US. His health insurance is costing me $1,000 a month. This isn't changeable within the next 10 months for reasons I won't bore you with. The insurance also isn't paying for a lot of medication or a specialized doctor who he needs. I'm spending at least $500 or more out of pocket every month for various care."

&#x200B;

\>  have you tried liquidised soup?

"It has to be cold enough to get the swelling in his throat down. It has to stick and stay in his stomach for a while too. If there is one that can do this, I am beyond open!"

&#x200B;

"\>  On the money side of things, here your husband would be entitled to PIP, Personal Independence Payments."

&#x200B;

"Funnily enough, he is British. When he was in the UK they fucked with his benefits so hard, you wouldn't believe. It was like they were deliberately trying to kill him. He's got 10 different, very serious, conditions, including traumatic brain injury, that makes life very difficult. Anyway, due to immigrating here, he's not allowed to leave the county for a while to go back. But, even if he did, life was hard there too. But, I swear to god, the ice cream is the breaking point in all of this. And, I know if he goes back, and continues to be uncared for there, he won't live much longer. It's such a fucking nightmare right now. If I had an ice cream solution it could maybe keep us patched up long enough to see to his other conditions."
> “nice” cream

"Just looked it up. Seems like this is a good jumping point. Another comment lead me to a product called thick-it, which might make smoothies feasible. Currently, they don't leave enough coating to help for very long. But, maybe the thinker will give the nice cream or smoothies  a better shot a working."

I'll look into powdered xylitol too.

"Thank you so much. I was in tears this morning as I was again spending money, I didn't have, on something I knew would make him worse. I'm going to try your suggestions."
> Cevimeline

I'm going to ask his doctor about this one. :) Ty.

"I buy it by the gallon, various garbage. A constancy that people would know that is good is Ben & Jerry's. Though, it has too much hard stuff it it for him to eat."
> Thickit.com

TY!!!! Looking at it now!
"I got fucked on insurance. We thought he could purchase it on the exchange / obamacare. But, turns out we are stuck in something called a ""family glitch."" Basically, if he's allowed by my employer to sign up for insurance then he can't get exchange coverage. Well, my workplace insurance sucks ass, covers nothing, and is $1,000 a month for him."
"Do you have the same problem where it feels red/raw all the way into your stomach? :( Sorry you are going through this too! I'm hoping to start making some ""nice cream"" but with thickener.. see how it goes.."
"I've spent 15,000 in the last 5 months keeping him alive and that's a drop in the bucket in total. Plus, 1,500 a month in bare minimum other health care related expenses. It's in the other comments. So, ya, that wouldn't be bad if we hadn't spent more money than most people earn in a lifetime, over the past 16 years to keep him breathing. Thanks!"
>I had no idea that Sjogren’s could get so bad

"I know, right!"

\>  I have heard about a procedure where people get their throats stretched.

I haven't heard about this. A quick google shows something called **Esophageal dilation.** I wonder if that would keep his throat from closing.. Anything is worth asking for. Thanks for the tip!
"\>  Water with ice in it is cold down the throat, healthier and more affordable."

"He HATES ice cream with a passion. But, he says this doesn't work as it doesn't stick. He doesn't seem to have any lubrication. It's so unhealthy, he's already become prediabetic, which is not something else we need. :("

&#x200B;

"So, I'm looking for something with the same exact consistency and sticking power and thick ice cream. He is going to an ENT next week.."
"> Ok, let's all get real here and point out that sugar is a huge inflammatory ingredient. Why the hell is he eating hundreds of grams of sugar just for the cold"

"YES!! You freaking get it. It's enraging. It's so damaging to all his other conditions, it's unreal."

> that he probably would'nt need if he wasn't inflaming the fuck out of himself with shit food? .. Clean up his diet. Remove the sugar. Increase his foods that are anti inflammatory

"His diet was megatastically healthy. We only ate organic, mostly from whole food, low glycemic diet, low inflammatory diet, leaning towards Mediterranean. A lot of work went into it. But, no, the throat shit maintained. I wish to god all that work we put in on diet helped. It didn't."

>  A gallon of ice cream because he thinks he needs it.

"It's like he grabs it out of desperation. I see him choking to death and gasping, it's the only thing that gives him relief. But, it comes with so much goddamned blowback, you understand why I'm at the breaking point. I just need the right solution to shove down his throat that freezes him all the way down, stays, and is affordable."

Thanks for mentioning prolon.. I had been trying to remember that diet but just couldn't. Thanks again.
"Yeah, ice cream with all that sugar and dairy will do crazy things to raise his inflammation levels!! Ah. That's tough. Something I find similar to ice cream is getting fruit (Costco sells mixes) and blending it with almond milk or whatever you have... Maybe throwing in some bananas. Makes it thicker... And put ice in it too to make it thicker. I'm so sorry! Sounds like he need to see an Ent? Maybe get a swallow study?"
"Until you can get him to a Dietitian, I liquidise frozen fruit into mush, you can put carrots, broccoli etc into it too, my kids never notice the veg. To make it into healthy ice-cream, I mix some into custard."
I'm so sorry you are going through this and I wish there was something I could do. Has he filed for social security disability? When was the last time he's had Prednisone? Sounds like he needs some kind of steroid for his throat.
"I hope it can help! It’s tough to think about getting creative in the kitchen when you’re emotionally burnt out and low on energy, but it might help!"

"For the thickness, adding unsweetened Greek yoghurt and lots of nut butter (peanut butter, almond butter) might help!"
The other saliva production medication is Salagen and a generic brand is available. Cevimeline is the generic name for brand name Evoxac.
There is also another saliva generating medicine. I haven’t tried either but maybe one will work?
"Yeah, I think many of us can relate to the financial burden.  Not sure if you need/want advice from a financial planner, dietician, or marriage counselor but thinking you just really need to vent."

"Although we may be able to solve your $300 ice cream problem, sounds like that's really not going to help much anyway."

It's hard to give advice with out knowing your options but I can't help but think spending most of your money to help keep your spouse breathing is probably money well spent.

I would consult a dietician to see not only what foods he may be able to eat but also to see if dietary changes could help his symptoms.  Good luck to you both.
I just realized what it could be in the ice cream that does it... its the dairy.  I have a few cousins who are singers and they dont eat dairy before going on stage because it creates a thick saliva...

I can only imagine your frustration.  And the position you're in.

ProLon has been a game changer for me.  Huge.  I've done 9 cycles and inflammation is ALMOST a thing of the past.  Takes so much more to activate it.
"So, you use a food processor or blender? Can you make it thick? Custard doesn't really exist where I am in the US but I can look up a recipe. If you have a rough estimate for the recipe you use and method, I'd appreciate it. I'll try it for sure!"
"He stays on steroids because he has Addisons, so he's dependent on them. Immigrants can't get SSI/disability. That's okay. We knew that in advance. It's just really, honestly, ice cream that's the problem. I can't afford it anymore and it's going to cause 100 other issues because a gallon of sugar a day is going to kill him .. but a slow expensive death. I can't go through that."
"I don't use a recipe, I buy bags of frozen fruit & put it in my liquidiser, you can make it as thick or thin as you want by adding water or fruit juice. Try the machines you mentioned & see if they work. I don't add sugar but you could if you want. I buy the ready-made cartons of low fat/sugar custard, yogurt would work too, again add until its the texture you want."
I bought saline mist spray tonight and putting that into my sinuses was like heaven. Then I sat over a humidifier under a towel for 5 mintues and it was a second heaven.
I didn't know...I didn't know how dry my insides could get.
AIP diet. used to have flare ups where i felt like i couldn’t take in a full breath. really solved this issue for me.
"I have a humidifier with essential oils that sometimes helps. I'm also taking Cordyceps mushroom powder which noticeably improves my ability to take in oxygen, especially when running"

"I second the advice about eliminating gluten, dairy and processed foods! Also refined sugars. It’s been 4 years since my diagnosis, I’m 29 now, & I’ve struggled greatly with this (I’m a very seasoned baker & home chef) but when I eat these things I’m guaranteed parotid swelling for at least 2 days. It does still happen occasionally even at my strictest, usually in the morning if I go too long without eating or drinking anything after waking. Hot compresses & massages help with pain. I usually just try to force myself to produce saliva when it happens, unless the pain is really too much to handle."

"My biggest issues are dry eyes, fatigue, dehydration, & joint pain. I currently don’t see a doctor, I haven’t found one that I like. I control my symptoms through diet, exercise, & stress management. Good sleep is really important too."

"I also take A LOT of supplements. Like, probably way too many. The one supplement I cannot live without is TheraTears Omega 3 tablets. If I forget to take them in the morning, I definitely notice throughout the day. I’ve taken other fish oil/omega 3 supplements that are more potent/from whole food sources/organic/etc, but for some reason I’ve seen the best results with these. I also use the Thermalon Dry Eye Compress twice a day. I saw it recommended on here & decided to give it a try, the combination of the fish oil tablets & the compress  has really helped with the discomfort of dry eyes.  Some other supplements I highly recommend: Vitamin D is also a life saver, most people with autoimmune conditions are extremely deficient. Collagen & turmeric are really good for inflammation, I drink a golden milk latte every night before bed."

"Staying hydrated is extremely important. I drink over a gallon of water a day & my thirst never feels quenched. I live in South Florida so that doesn’t help either. My electrolytes are always low too, coconut water helps with this."

"As far as work, I’ll be a SAHM for another year, so I can’t give advice there, unfortunately. I will give this added advice that you didn’t ask for,  it really helps to have someone you can relate with. The hardest part of all this for me really has been that no one understands. It sucks being so young dealing with a chronic illness. I get so much shit from family members & friends who just don’t understand when I’m having a flare that I’m not being lazy or bitchy, I’m just experiencing severe pain & fatigue. A lot of them are unsympathetic the my dietary restrictions too. I’ve had a couple flares due to family members lying about ingredients at family functions. So, that can add to stress which leads to inflammation & flares. My mom was also diagnosed with a few autoimmune diseases at 24, I confide in her a lot. My husband is really supportive too."

"Another bit of unsolicited advice: stay on top of your dental care. It was actually a very perceptive dentist that led to me get diagnosed. I had severe gum disease at 24 years old & my dentist was determined to figure out why because I didn’t consume a lot of sugar & my teeth themselves were in great shape. She did noticed my saliva was a weird consistency & after a few days of research she called me suggesting I get tested for Sjorgrens. After a deep cleaning of my gums, I now go for cleanings every 3 months. I oil pull every morning & brush with activated charcoal. My gum are now back to normal & healing."

"So yeah! I guess that’s my take, sorry it’s so lengthy. Good luck! You’ll get through this. ❤️"

"Edited to add this: idk if you’re into alternative medicine, but my sister in law is a Chinese medicine practitioner & suggested I try acupuncture. She had a patient with sicca that found relief from her symptoms with acupuncture, but that was not the case for me. Due to my chronic dehydration, both times were extremely painful. I’m totally into alternative medicine & as mentioned, I’ve had great results from lifestyle & dietary changes, but just use caution & do your research if going down that route."
"I started getting parotid swelling at 18 and it got progressively worse until I was 21/22. Finally i figured out that it was diet related. I eliminated many processed foods, gluten, and most sources of dairy from my diet, started drinking more water, started exercising, and did not have the swelling again until about 2 years ago (I’m 38, so went about 15 years without having it). I have it off and on now but not near as bad as back then...I’ll just feel a slight sense of fullness under my ear for a day or 2, and then it’ll go away. For me, touching it and rubbing it makes it worse. If I feel anything there, I just very gently rub some coconut oil with essential oils on the skin along my jaw and then don’t touch it for the rest of the day. The oil seems to loosen things up, and isn’t as irritating as massaging and messing with it."

"Do you wear blue blocker glasses at work? Can you adjust the light on your computer screen? I think it’s fine to tell work you have an autoimmune disease and need to attend certain doc appts. You can explain it to them, but be prepared that they still may not really understand or relate. Unless they have a similar illness, or have a close family member or friend who has, a lot of people just don’t get it. If you feel your job isn’t a good fit, then I’d look for a different one that might be better suited for you. If you’re able to work though, I would. Having the structure of a job is not a bad thing. You need something flexible enough that you can take time to go to appts, and also with hours that allow you to come home and make yourself dinner and get to bed on time...no 50 hour work weeks."
"I don’t really get that, but I do get sharp submandular pain without swelling.  In my case, some of it was from constantly sucking and pushing my tongue against the jaw to try to get saliva production— staying hydrated helps, as does wearing a custom made mouth guard at night - as I sleep, I chew on it to get the same effect with less jaw pain.  The sports mouth guards  just fall out as I sleep, but they are a lot cheaper and might work for you."
"The really strange thing that actually does seem to help is ear drops.  I think mine are for swimmers although motion sickness ones work too.  I started using them for vertigo/dizziness, but they somehow seem to help with jaw pain? Maybe the feeling of liquid in my ear tricks me somehow."
"None of this may be relevant to you, as it seems like a different symptom, but I thought I’d throw it out there."
"28M, recently diagnosed and dealing with similar symptoms. Happy to talk, as another person mentioned, it helps a lot"
"Thank you for this response. I’m 30yoF too, and you’re totally right about others not understanding. I sometimes vent wayyy too much to my husband because he’s the only one who gets it. I feel bad Even my therapist tries to deny my pain. “we can get rid of it in session” *eyeroll*"
Thank you so much for taking the time to write this for me! I really appreciate the tips and am very interested in trying the diet advice in particular. Hope you are all feeling well today with your symptoms.
"Thanks so much for the tips; very interested in trying the diet adaptations. I definitely want to keep working but am currently in law and realising this will be a very difficult field to stay in full time with the long, strict work hours and associated stress. Thanks again!"
Please get a new therapist! Experiencing chronic pain at such a young age is not a fly by joke
So is this related to Sjogrens? I have some of these issues too but I always thought was from being very sensitive in general.

I'm sorry you have to live like this. Being uncomfortable and in pain constantly is exhausting.
How horrible. What immunosuppressants are you taking? What is your diet like?
"Have you seen a neurologist? There is some nerve involvement with sjogrens, but it sounds like yours is pretty advanced."
"Before I got diagnosed, I remember not even being able to reach into my purse to grab keys. My fingers would be in so much pain from touching anything and I would get indentations. My fingers also had this constant pruned appearance, which responded to every little touch of temperature change. I will say this has stopped since being on the placquenil."
"Yup, I know those feels.  When I'm at my worst, my scalp and the skin on my forearms, face, and eyelids (where the lashes are) burns and feels like needles are being shoved into it.  Good times.  I also can't use most skincare now because everything gives me welts and rashes."
I avoid the sun and use a fuckload of CeraVe moisturizer 3-5 times a day. Helps some.
"I have small fiber neuropathy related to Sjogren’s, Lyrica helps. After showering using ice if you feel itchy. There are some lotions that can help, but those are subjective. Not that you can really  do it all the time, but coconut oil can help sometimes after a shower especially."

"Also, it sounds like your doctors might not be hearing you and if possible you might want to look for new ones."

Good luck!
"Yeah, I have nerve damage too. Took me a while to figure out my tremors are from the  Sjögren’s. 🤡 *Surprise!*"

Literally at one point I thought my fingers were trembling because I was “nervous” even when I wasn’t feeling nervous—it must be the brainfog. 😑 I have automatic ✨⚡️ Jazz 👐🏼 Hands ⚡️✨ now. 💁🏻‍♀️🐈

"Okay on a serious note, OP: I’m surprised your GP won’t refer you to a specialist. I can understand him not wanting to give you painkillers, but it’s odd that he won’t let you see a specialist?"

"And why are you still seeing a GP, my “main” doctor after diagnoses is a Rheumatologist who regularly refers me each quarter to either an ophthalmologist or a physiotherapist + bloodwork (and no doubt if I ever complained my neuropathy getting unbearable she would let me see a neurologist)."

Can you switch to a different hospital/doctor’s office with a more flexible GP?

You’re not in the Netherlands are you? Because I know they can be strict about sticking to their GPs.
"Does anyone know which medications I should be taking, for pain and all of it really.  Gabapentin?  Amitriptyline?  Duloxetine?"
It must be related :(  I'm sorry too.  I just am appalled at how my life has fallen apart.  Are you coping?
"My nerve issues are not as bad as OPs, but yes my rheumatologist said it was due to sjogrens."
"They refuse to prescribe immnouppresents, both GPs and Rheumatologist."
They won't see me.  They say they have no serious concerns.  My GP won't prescribe me pain killers and won't refer me.  He says he has no magic wand and I have to accept it.  I am appalled and frightened.
They won't prescribe me Plaquenil.
Is there nothing we can do?  Meds?  Anything? :(
All doctors I see refuse to believe there's any connection between Sjogrens/Sicca and SFN.  They won't prescribe me Lyrica.  It doesn't matter who I see.  Today I was told I won't be referred to the pain clinic.  When I suggested I would go to the hospital the GP smirked and said they won't do very much for you.
The private Rheumatologist I saw said I have Sicca but couldn't prove Sjogren's despite me having all the same symptoms and some inflammation present in the biopsy.  She said therefore I won't be prescribed Plaquenil.

I only see a GP because they will not allow me to have a rheumatologist or any team or structure.  I am under the NHS in the UK.  All GPs I have seen insist there is no reason and no purpose to being under a rheumatologist.  Understand this is the same for any GP I have seen.  Therefore I had to go private.  The private rheumatologist (I have no private insurance so have to pay in full) has seen me and says I have Sicca.  She says there is nothing more to add.

No GP will allow me to see a neurologist and the neurologist my GP wrote to said they have no serious concerns.  Since I have deteriorated I have told them again and the answer is the same.  They will certainly no do QSART testing or skin biopsies.  My GP said that even if they did what good would it do?  He said he has no magic wand.

"I can switch my GP yes but I have tried various GPs.  The male GPs have been absolutely awful.  Arrogant, uncaring, and unable to listen."

It is at a point that hearing 'What do you want us to do?  No we won't refer you to the pain clinic' means I have effectively given up on the health system.

They won't even acknowledge that I have nerve damage.  Apart from the conduction test which my doctor have no idea was unrevealing (they have no clue and we of course do) nobody will do anything else.

"Throughout this I have generally been disbelieved by family or they don't have any idea of the full seriousness of it.  I have therefore gone from being close to a very large family, to being isolated.  Despite them later admitting that I do actually have a problem."

"I hope I don't get the tremors, but the dry skin and nerve pain all over is debilitating.  I have no idea how I am still at work either.  What a mess."
Oh and thank you.
Sending you internet hugs (which are nice in this case because there's no skin to skin contact lol).

"I cope by smoking pot for now. Which sucks, for many reasons, but mostly because I can't be high 24/7. So when I can't smoke I just put up with it and use mindfulness techniques to help me get by. But it sounds like you are much worse off than I am at this time. Have you brought it up with a medical professional?"
"I see, thank you."
What’s your diet like? Do you eat gluten?
"I just take a lot of Ibuprofen.  Calms down the skin pain. :/  And I noticed that CBD oil is actually helpful with joint pain.  Doing a FODMAP diet is just overall helpful, and I notice it when I misstep and eat something I shouldn't, like eggs.  But yeah, it's otherwise just pushing through and hoping it'll calm down (I had a three-year period with no pain, so here's hoping)."
"Wow, I’m so sorry that you’re experiencing that. I had a two small punch biopsies of my leg to show that I have SFN, but that was done by my rheumatologist who is wonderful. Insurance didn’t cover most of that, but at least I had confirmation of what was going on and it allowed me to change treatment appropriately. I’m mostly at a loss for you other than hoping there might be a Sjögrens group local to you that could refer you to better providers."
"That is absurd. Has your Rheumatologist run an ANA/RN test on you? I’m surprised so many people on Reddit are saying they still do biopsies (it sounds painful, expensive/complicated, and unnecessary)."

"Also, I’ve never heard of Sjögren’s being referred to as “Sicca” before (had to Google that)."

"Anyway, I can totally vouch for what you said about male doctors. They won’t listen, they are arrogant and patronising, and they get annoyed (*defensive*, almost) when I tell them I’ve Googled something at home. The female doctors get excited when I tell them I looked something up online because they want to talk about it. It’s like they’re happy I did my homework or something!"

Not gender stereotyping but it’s so true!

"It’s come to a point where if Hospital réception can’t give me a female doctor’s name, I’ll ask for a reschedule until I get a female name. Unless it’s something really urgent. All my doctors (rheumatologist, physiotherapist, ophthalmologist) are an all-female team. LOL."

"Sorry about your insurance situation. My family didn’t think I was worth insuring, either (I’m kind of worthless that way LMAO). 😂 They gave me an “emergency credit card” which I’ve been using for medical expenses but they’re mad at me right now and cut me off and now all I have left is my vitamin D gel pills (I think I’ll get myself some turmeric pills next). 🤣 I miss my doctors and actually WhatsApp-ed them to say I “have technical issues with HSBC” and would be away for a while (I lied LOL because I was embarrassed that I had no money to go, but I didn’t want them to think I left them for another hospital & hurt their feelings). Anyway, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to hijack your thread but I don't want you to think I have a private team of doctors like I’m Venus Williams or something. I struggle to pay in full too."

"Some members of my family don't take my autoimmune disease seriously, either. You’re not alone in this. The whole thing is so life-shattering."

"I hope you don’t develop tremors, either."

"But if it makes you feel any better, it’s mostly unnoticeable and unless you’re, like, a surgeon/jewellery-maker or something, it won’t ruin your life."

"Maybe just a little embarrassing sometimes (like if you’re public-speaking in front of a very quiet auditorium, and you hold a piece of paper, everyone will hear the quiver of the paper in your hand—but other than that, it’s barely noticeable)."

Take care. 💜
"I’ve found smoking pot to cause chest tightness and heart palpations since I got this so I have to avoid it. This never used to happen before I got sick. Has it affected you smoking pot, do you get any of this?"
Yes and I really get nowhere.
"Do you know which medications I should be taking, for pain and all of it really.  Gabapentin?  Amitriptyline?  Duloxetine?"
Yes I eat Gluten.
Yes no Ana RNA.
"Do you know which medications I should be taking, for pain and all of it really.  Gabapentin?  Amitriptyline?  Duloxetine?"
"I don't know if its the same thing, but after I take a break for a few months and start smoking again my heart races and my chest tightens if I smoke too much. I just start with teeny tiny amounts and slowly work up again. Once I build a tolerance I don't get the heart and chest thing. But that's just me!"
"I am not too sure, the only prescription med I tried for pain was Meloxicam, but that was for joint pain. It helped but it also fucked my stomach up."

"Actually since I last interacted with you I had to quit smoking pot. I was getting withdrawals when I wasn't smoking, lots of puking. Tried CBD oil and am having HUGE success. It put a stop to the nausea, helped my anxiety, appetite, sleep, joint pain, sciatica, nerve pain... I recommend it over smoking pot now lol"
"I looked at your post history, and see that you’ve been asked about your diet before. You responded that you eat healthy. Eating healthy works for most people...but you have an autoimmune disease, you can’t just eat healthy. I’d really encourage you to eliminate some very basic inflammatory foods from your diet. Since you already eat healthy, I’m assuming you don’t eat sugar/fried food/fast food...so next to go would be gluten and casein. Replace them with cooked vegetables, healthy oils and fats, and white basmati rice if you need a starch."
"Sounds the same, that makes sense actually it’s good to know it can go away, thanks."
Thank you.  Why are they inflammatory foods?  I guess I just don't understand.
"Yeah. It's a super scary feeling, thankfully it never lasts forever."

"I recommend if possible seeing a different doctor and being assertive about your symptoms, try to get them to refer you to a neurologist."

You are welcome. Wish you the best.
"Processed grains drive inflammation by spiking your blood sugar. Blood sugar spikes = inflammation. My MIL is diabetic, and gets a bigger spike from a piece of bread than she does a candy bar. Processed carbs also feed bad gut bacteria and fungus in your gut. Gluten in particular is believed to be damaging to the gut lining. As far as dairy goes, I think some people can get away with it and some people can’t. The proteins in dairy are irritating to some people and if you discover you have an issue with gluten, then it’s possible you have the same issue with casein."
See a Rheumatologist if you can as soon as possible.  Don't let GPs put you off either which they will likely try to do often.
"From my understanding, it is not uncommon for people to be diagnosed with Sjogren's, despite testing negative for SSa/SSb. A Sjogren's diagnosis is based on evaluation of the whole picture, which can include lab tests, but also symptoms. If your dr doesn't diagnose you based on negative lab results, you can either point out research showing that [bloodwork isn't always an indicator](https://labtestsonline.org/conditions/sjogren-syndrome), ask for other tests (such as a [lip biopsy](https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/2018/11/15/lip-biopsy-sensitive-diagnostic-criteria-sjogrens-syndrome-study/) or [Schirmer tear test](https://www.healthline.com/health/schirmers-test)), or you could always see a different provider that is more open."

"As far as tooth decay, that is an issue with Sjogren's (dry mouth). I'd recommend adding a daily fluoride rinse, as well as getting fluoride treatment at your dentist. The dentist normally only offers the flouride treatment for kids, so you may need to ask about it. I started doing this years ago (before I got diagnosed), and went from 1-3 cavities a year to 1 every 3-5 years. And a fun bonus, as it's normally meant for kids, you get to pick fun flavors like bubblegum or raspberry! ;)"

"Another thing you may want to check out is acid-reflux or [GERD](https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/guide/reflux-disease-gerd-1#1). I had problems with acid-reflux at night, so I didn't realize I had any problems, but I was experiencing a lot of teeth-decay due to stomach acid."

"Anyway, good luck!!!"

"Edit: I've heard of drug-induced Lupus, so maybe it relate to Sjogren's as well?"
I’ve been told by my rheumatologist that an illness can “trigger” it and it is related to trauma and stress.

"Mine suddenly started in 2016 after I was really ill. I will fine before that, no symptoms what so ever. Now I suffer everyday. I also had childhood trauma and anxiety. He thinks the two are connected."
"I echo all the sentiments previously stated. Don't let a GP or any doctor dismiss your symptoms. I had a lip biopsy and it came back negative. At age 26 I was basically a medical mystery when the nerves and tissue in my feet started being attacked by my immune system. My neurologist was convinced I had Lupus but couldn't prove it. He tried all kinds of tests and medication on me and nothing gave me a diagnosis or relief. \*\*He put me on Neurontin which made the nerve pain in my feet and legs even worse and had terrible side effects. Finally by process of elimination they diagnosed SS. But the only thing that got my initial onset to subside enough so the  nerve pain almost completely stopped and my feet could regain some strength and flexibility, was Prednisone. Once my symptoms were under control I weaned off the Prednisone and started Plaquenil.  Years later when  I was frustrated with flare ups of nerve pain, my rheumatologist put me back on Neurontin. Big mistake, within days I was in more pain."

"Sorry for rambling, but I hope my story and others gives you some support and  encouragement. Symptoms and treatment can vary for everyone but there is some relief. **You are your best advocate.** Don't settle until you feel your needs and questions have been met. Seek out support, my therapist is a huge support. Forums like this one are priceless. **You're not alone! HUGS!!**"
"Your situation is very similar to mine.  I have even more medical issues now.  I have no antibodies and they refuse to diagnose me with Sjogren's, only Sicca.  Very frustrating as they are both essentially the same.  I was am avid jogger and gym 5 days a week.  My hair has done the same and falls everywhere.  It is unmanageable now.  I've found no way to improve any of this.  Sorry but i'm being honest."
Yes its possible to have negative blood antibodies. You should see a rheumatologist if you haven't yet (the other issues sound autoimmune). Ask for a lip biopsy if you want to completely rule out Sjogren's.

"I can't say what's wrong, but it sounds bad. Hang in there, make sure you are chasing every lead and not taking any crap from the doctors."
Autonomic nervous system dysfunction can cause sicca symptoms. It’s not always autoimmune. It makes me wonder if the neuroleptics you were on messed you up. How long have you been off of that?

"Sjogren’s can be triggered by physical trauma too, so it could def be that. It’s very possible to have a negative SSA/B and still have SS. I’d be relentless and keep going to doctors until you find out what it is. In the meantime, treat your symptoms. Use eye drops, lotion, moisturize your hair and scalp as best you can, sleep with xylimelts in and get a prescription fluoride toothpaste (NeutraMaxx is the best if you can find a dentist who will prescribe it. I prefer it over the crest one)."
Probiotics might replace those lost
> frequent urination

"Did they by chance test your blood sugar? Contrary to popular belief, you can develop type 1 diabetes at any age."
"Not sure if this will help you, but were the antibiotics you were on Cipro or any other in that class of drugs? You could have fluoroquinolone toxicity, floxed as it’s sometime referred, a rare but pretty serious side effect of those antibiotics, something to look into maybe if you’re coming up empty for answers elsewhere."
Try to get a lip biopsy. It's what a lot of doctors require before they start believing you have Sjögren's

"Edit: whatever, downvote me, this was my exact experience though. Doctors kept insisting I was a hypochondriac until one sent me to get a lip biopsy , then they were like ""oh shit yeah you have this"""
Have you had hormone levels tested? I suspect it could also be related to low testosterone (which I definitely didn’t have prior to all this but now am 190ng/dl)
Make sure lab is used to Sjögren biopsy.   Lots of labs do them so rarely you get false negatives.   Make sure you get copies of slides.
John Hopkins Sjögren center doesn’t trust other labs and will ask or the images.

Ultrasound on Salvitory glands is less invasive.
My lip biopsy were negative.  Salvutory  was positive.
"Been off of the neuroleptics for 5+ months, how would you recommend moisturizing the scalp?"
"Good call, been drinking Kombucha and taking probiotic supplements"
"Yes that was a concern because apparently the drug they had me on can cause diabetes so I’ve had 3 separate rounds of blood work that included blood sugar, good idea tho ty"
"Yes I have been tested.  They say my testosterone is normal.  If I say yes but what is normal on the test (averages) may not be for me.  Nothing we can do to help with that sorry, the test says normal it's normal.  Bye.  That's all I get."
"Rub a couple tablespoons of olive oil in your hair and massage into your scalp, let sit for 15 minutes then shower as usual. You may have to shampoo a couple times to wash it all out or it can leave your hair looking greasy."
"You can also use pure Argan oil after you shower (in the US Trader Joe’s has it for a very good price, $6 a bottle if I remember correctly.) Just use a couple of drops, rub between your hands and run hands over hair and scalp. Make sure it’s pure Argan oil, I accidentally bought one that had other ingredients in it and my hair stylist pointed out that it had silicone which was preventing my hair from getting the moisture from the oils because it costs the hair and keeps other things out"
"Yeah 190ng/dl is “normal” here in Canada but I know a biochemist and he said men tend to get health effects and depression/anxiety below 4 or 500ng/dl the lower it goes the larger the health effects. Even studies show that low testosterone is a pre-requisite for autoimmune disease, that’s why women are 10x more likely to get an autoimmune disorder."

"Even 240 is the bar in the US, but the bar in Canada is like 100 or something ridiculous. The urology association of America has the low end at 300ng/dl"

"Mine was almost 700 a year ago and they consider it “normal” that it’s now 190, to me that’s closed minded an insane to not think that’s significant"
Worse is you can't reverse an auto immune disorder.  It staggers me that we are a light year away from doing this.
I'm disgusted with how the medical system works.  Mine also dropped but they still consider it normal.  I can't remember what they said it is now.  I believe also that it is a major cause of my many problems now but they are not interested in that.  I am deeply appalled at how primitive modern medicine is with these problems.
I do get indirections if I lay my legs or feet on something metal. They Last forever. I can’t see to drink enough fluids to ever seem normal. It’s even affecting my kidneys and urine flow. It’s been getting worse since 2011. My eyes are so blurry now I find it hard to drive at night especially in the rain. I do delivery for food. And I can never see the house numbers. Sorry for all who suffer from this invisible disease.
"I have rashes on my arms (mostly, they also appear elsewhere). I suspect it's polymorphic light eruption (or something similar due to meds/autoimmune stuff). It gets a lot better when I wear long sleeves outside."

CeraVe moisturizer is also really good for skin. I also use witch hazel (a toner) to help clean and sanitize really rough skin.

"My hair goes through phases of being good and bad. It's tough as a woman because I feel like I have to keep my hair longer but it's difficult to get it to look nice when it's curly, dry, and breaks easily. Fall in love with leave in conditioner and dry shampoo 😃"

It totally does suck but we're all sort of struggling together. Everyone is fighting some kind of battle.
"Wow, you’re the first person I’ve heard mention skin indentations.  For me sitting on the toilet with my elbows on my thighs reading or checking emails on phone will leave indentations that last for an hour or more.  Same thing crossing my legs where one leg crosses the other.  Sometimes socks will leave a perfect imprint.   As far as the hair, I gave up on that years ago.  I just barber to use #2 all the way around.  There will be good days and bad.  Everyone has their own way of coping and I hope you find one that works for you."
"I get them too, and blurry reading this"
"I’m so sorry you are going through this! For rashes, I indirectly found that high-zinc sunscreen helped them. I use Sun Bum’s mineral face stick on my arm and it helps tremendously. For indents, make sure you are hydrated and have adequate circulation. I use Lion’s Mane to help with that."
"I just got officially diagnosed. I have found jogging helps my symptoms a lot. I do it twice a day when I can. Sorry to hear about your struggle, it all started for me in my mid-20s, so I know it all too well."
"Oh my god yes! I've only just started getting rashes but I've had the freaky, lingering indentations for ages! Never connected the dots to sjogren's! Thanks so much!"
So I saw a new GP today and had only 10 minutes.  He said he would talk to a private Rheumatologist for advice on Plaquenil but I don't hold out much hope.  I wasnt given enough time to ask about the other medications or discuss anything else.  I don't hold out much hope.
Yea the Rheumatologist declined me having Plaquenil.
I'm scared for what happens next really.
"It's tough as a man too, when you've always had longer hair you loved.  I thank you for your reply."
I should be clear the indents are everywhere and deep.  It looks very unsightly.
Thank you.  I'm doing very badly at the moment.  Very.
Thank you.
I'll try jogging but I get muscle convulsions and my skin dries out.  :(
Have you ever had your thyroid levels checked?
[Hypothyroidism ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20350284) can cause some of the symptoms you’ve mentioned.  Hang in there.
"I get it, but seriously just go for a 5 -10 minute jog and notice how you feel for the next couple hours afterwards. I may be an outlier, but it is night and day for me."
Yes I have.  All normal.  Thank you.
I'll try it.  I will.

"Xylimelts,"
"Silk sleep mask,"
"Microwave eye mask, Badger balm (they have aromatherapy or pain balms that are nice)"
"All of the therapy options already listed are great. Your friend might also like some non-Sjogren's related items. What are their favorite snacks, books, or activities? Maybe a gift card for an online purchase. Sometimes it helps to have those non-condition related comforts."
You can get oil soaked toothpicks on Amazon that are AMAZING at getting the salivary glands moving without the fear of using xylitol.
"Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash. I realized how beneficial the mouthwash is when I travelled and did not want to take it along. My teeth became way more sensitive, so it does not only help with the dryness."
"Wanted to share - if you're in the US- the best and cheapest chap stick (lip balm) I've found is Kroger brand- ""Simple Truth Organic- Moisturizing Lip Balm"".  Sometimes I'm able to buy it for .99cents. But where I am in TX it's normally $1.99. It is so worth it."

The ingredient list:

"Organic sunflower oil, organic beeswax, organic cocoa butter, organic coconut oil, organic vanilla flavor, organic honey flavor"
Thank you!!!
I did get her one of my favorite water bottles (it’s a Zojirushi and it’s the BEST) already!
"100% get xylimelts!!! Also, an eye mask that can be warmed up - causes eyes to release tears which helps with dryness."
Excellent!! That’s great to know!
What oil are they soaked in?
Oh fantastic! Good to know! Thank you!
That’s a perfect list!

"I’d donate, but I’m in New Jersey"
I'm in Texas. Wish I could donate plasma.
That would be quite the commute! Hope all is well in NJ : )
"I'm about to head to bed with sleep meds so hopefully this makes sense, but I coughed up extra money to upgrade my rx glasses at zennieoptical.com to have glasses that help protect my eyes from blue light+UV rays inside and out. I know it's not a full solution to the sunlight, but it's made a huge impact in my ability to get away without sunglasses on gloomy days and light sensitive from electronics."

"Frames start at $6 or $7, for clear lenses you'll want their blublocker lenses which cost a little extra, but are the big deal and they carry a variety of sunglasses lense options. In the end you end up with a customized pair of glasses that help protect your eyes from sunlight that will be in your prescription or non prescription 3-4 weeks later deliver to your door"

"I get this really bad- I absolutely can’t drive if I don’t wear sunglasses, and during college if I had a class in a room with a lot of windows I had to wear sunglasses indoors. At this point I’ve basically accepted that sunglasses are a necessity, and I get multiple cheap pairs to have on hand. I’ve had issues with vitamin D deficiency and b12 deficiency as well."
"I can relate to this. I used to love the sun,  now i hate it. Have you noticed your vision getting worse or your eyes just wondering off and having a hard time focusing them?  I feel intoxicated sometimes because i can't control my vision. It's weird."
"It’s really weird but my vitamin d levels are above normal range, also b12. But I’ve got a quite a bad case of sjögren’s anyways."

"And the sun... Dear god. Now that it’s spring time and there’s more and more light, on most days I feel like all I can see is white brightness. And it hurts my eyes a lot. Ugh."
"Yep, I've always got to have sunglasses on because it's so bright and my Vitamin D level was very low. I take high levels of Vitamin D to make up for it."
"I need to have an eye exam done, because my eye vision went downhill since the Sjogrens. I will keep this in mind! Thank you so much!"
"I did the same after losing my last pair, got a “higher end” base frame at like $35, added all the bells and whistles and rush delivery for a total of around $90, and received them 6 days later. So grateful, between Sjogrens and constant migraine auras, the week without sunglasses was hell."

"I get a lot of comments when I wear sunglasses at the office, as if I’m trying to draw attention to myself rather than doing everything in my power to make it through a work day. So it’s embarrassing to wear them, but it’s blinding pain without them - I guess it’s an easy choice?"
"I'm that person who wears sunglasses in doors. Flourescent lighting is just as bad as sunlight! Its funny my PCP didn't test me for it sooner because she came into the room a few times and asked why I was wearing sunglasses and I told her the lights drive my eyes crazy and they turn bloodshot in flourescent lighting.  I never thought much about it, but I had that problem since my teenage years. My friend would ask why my eyes were so blood shot inside the store and I could never understand it. A few months ago I was inside the gas station one morning, paying for gas and grabbing coffee and snack cakes for my friends little boy (and myself, they were those Christmas tree snack cakes with the green sprinkles, I love them!) and this guy looked at me and said ""Ahhh... Munchies huh?"" And gave me the ""I am a stoner too look"" and I just looked at him like yeah, haha. Then realized afterward he was saying it because my eyes were bloodshot. *Sigh* I rotate between Visine and lubricating drops. Lol. Speaking of cheap sunglasses, just got some cool ones from the Dollar Tree and a pair at Family Dollar yesterday. Lol Five Below is my favorite for sunglasses."
"My vision gets blurry sometimes. I get blepharitis. I'm losing my eyelashes in certain spots, they are thinning. My eyes get so red and irritated that yes I sometimes feel and look completely stoned. And people think that I am. I always have a hard time focusing on the morning. I can't see right in the morning. The sun is like nails on a chalkboard. AHHHH! It hurts! I had a bad day today. Bad headaches and my eyes are in bad shape. I think I may have a flare up coming on cause it always starts with a terrible headache."
That's weird! Did they say what made them higher than normal? Healthy diet? Any weird side effects from the high levels?
"No problem, if you end up needing glasses ask for them to write down your PD (how far apart your pupils are) when they give you a copy of your prescription. Don't be afraid to shop around if your insurance will cover frames and try on some glasses to get an idea of what size (the numbers on the inside of the arm on the glasses) and style frames you want because it makes ordering easier."

I'm also happy to give you a referral code to zennie if you decide to go through them 🤓
"Oh man, I deal with migraines too and wear my sunglasses at work. Staring at a computer screen all day does NOT help. 😞"
Lol I get mine at dollar tree as well!
Your symptoms sound just like mine. What does your flare up look like? Mine starts with a horrible headache that lasts for weeks. By the end of the flare the pain moves to the bottom right of my skull. This happens with excruciating leg pain (feels like i am wearing super right jeans for days). Do you get tingling or numbing? I am sorry for all the questions. I am trying to figure out my symptoms. Drs I've seen lately have been ignoring my symtoms.
"Yeah! Headache for days! Literally! I at first always think it's allergies. The headache doesn't go away. Then I end up thinking I'm going through Pepsi withdrawal, that doesn't help. Tylenol doesn't help neither does Ibuprofen. It is more like a headache in the back of my skull. It's funny you mentioned the right sided neck pain because I catch myself rubbing that area a lot during this time. Then my eyes get sunken in, red, sensitive, burning etc, blepharitis, loss of eyelashes, tenderness near my temples that feels like bruising, my face gets red like a very light Lupus butterfly rash, and itchy and hot, sometimes my ears get red and hot if I get a little stressed out, if I am really upset I break out in hives all over my chest and neck, ...in my left hand, the muscle in my thumb in the palm swells up and it radiates up my arm into my shoulder, like a tendinitis, and it's hard to grasp objects like my phone, but I'm used to the pain and do it anyway, I end up icing it, the ""ball"" under Neath my right big toe gets sore and i immediately need to take my shoe off and rub it! When I first found out I had Sjogrens I sufferered a severe flare up for almost two months and my left foot up to my knee went numb for two weeks, and I get reaaally tired and when i try to wake up i can't move because my whole body feels so weak and tired that I feel that i could sleep forever! Our weather here has been cold and rainy, for days, and it's really hard on me, CBD helps me alot, especially my hands! I put it in my vape. Been dealing with some pretty bad constipation too, and today I had absolutely no appetite, haven't had one for a few days. I don't mind the question dear. Sorry for the run on sentences 😆"
"Hey, Assiramama, just a quick heads-up:"
"**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**."
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Thank you for sharing your symtoms with me. I don't feel so crazy after all. Your symtoms are so similar to.mine wow.   I need to try a better cbd i haven't had much luck.
"Neuropathy can be a symptom of Sjogrens (not sure about Lupus).  Ask your doctor about a referral to a neurologist to have a nerve conduction study done.  Also, some people find that cutting back on salt can help with it.  I personally find that it happens more to me on days when I've had a lot of salt and haven't kept up with my water intake."
https://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/disease-information/sjogrens-syndrome/neurologic-complications/
"This doesn't answer your question (I'm sorry), but wearing wrist splints/ braces when you sleep can help prevent awkward positions that may compress your nerves. (I had carpal tunnel previously, and wearing splints at night helped a lot.  Different condition of course)"

"I would still see your doctor, but splints might be able help until then (if the pain is caused by a funny wrist position for example)."
Same! Even while I'm awake now!
"I get numbness and tingling too! I'll get it in my arm & hand, then it will move to my other arm & hand, then same with my legs, and sometimes even my face. It's also very painful as the numbness wears off. I usually only get this during bad flares, but I've had it every night this past week. Not fun. Hope we all get better sleep soon! Glad to hear I'm not alone! Thank you for this post!"
Sounds like Small fiber neuropathy can dx with skin biopsy. If you have this you may qualify for ivig. Which in some cases reverses neuropathy. Prob have to see an autonomic neuro for this.
It’s usually only approved if you have multiple AI like sjogrens and Hashimotos or something else and you have neuropathy caused by AI
It happens to me too. I read somewhere to turn your head the other way and it helps. Rotating your neck does something to bring it out of numbness.
Thank you
Thank you that was very informative
Thank you 😊
That’s interesting. Can you point to any research papers talking about this?

Thank you!
How much for ur username
"That was my first symptom, and my eyes would just get crusted over several times a night, it was the pits."

Sometimes I find drinking too much water kind of washes me out - it's hard to explain. I drink tons of tea without caffeine.

"I was also telling another poster today that I find good fats really helps with my sicca symptoms - avocados, coconut, sea buckthorn supplements, all those good omega fats."

"Funny, when I was diagnosed I'd been living with symptoms for years."
It's not weird at all. Just remember to use the right type. Long term use of eye drops containing salt and / or preservatives can actually make dry eyes worse.
"I personally like the preservative-free Thera Tears, recommended by The Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation."
Have you heard of this device?  http://www.umay.care  It was on the today show and was at CES.  Looks like a drop alternative. My eye doc was talking about it.
Yes. Avocados! I went on a random diet where I ate 1 full avocado a day as a snack. About 30 minutes after the avocado my eyes would feel amazing. I could cry and everything. Then they would dry up in about 2 hours later. I still try to eat them but I'm serious burnt out on them. Wish the moisture was more long lasting.
"Yeah, I have been taking omega 3 vitamins, well starting yesterday."

"It's such a random disorder. I feel like a lot of people, especially those with milder side effects, might never find out officially."
Thanks for letting me know! I will definitely keep that in mind!
"Thank you for hooking me up with this, I have been trying to find the right kind, but I didn't get a lot of guidance."
"Yeah, I've never been tested, I'm a textbook case symptomatically."
"Yes,  i agree that you need to get the right drops. I was diagnosed over a year ago,  and straight away my eye doctor prescribed me Hylan eyedrops (the single use ones) i put them in 6 times a day. Now within the last 3 months she also prescribed me Vidisic ( made by Bausch and Lomb) which is the gel. I use it at least 3 times a day."

So the prescription drops and gels are the ones that work for me.
Thanks for the avocado tip..... never knew.

"*note,  I'm in europe..... but im sure google will tell you what these meds are called where you live"
"You're so welcome. I would add that some people like the gel kind because they keep your eyes moist longer, but I haven't yet tried them and I don't know if they have preservatives or not. Best of luck!"
Well I'm glad you found out about the disorder at least!
"I'm going to try the overnight ointments and see how that works as well. Hopefully it helps. All I have right now are refresh preservative free. It works well, for now, but it has salt in it."
"I think this question was asked recently, so you may find more answers if you search for that post. I struggle with this. People always complain about how cold I keep my house, and I often sleep with ice packs. Before Sjogrens I was always the cold person in the room, but now I live in a permanent hot flash. I asked my rheumatologist about it, and he said it’s a complaint he hears from a number of his sjogrens patients."
"Sometimes I'll be super cold in a 78° room, huddle under the blankets to 20 minutes later I'm sweating and boiling. Or another day the same room, same temperature, I'm super hot. There's also times when the  hottest of hot water isn't hot enough in the shower, and I'm still cold wherever the stream isn't hitting me. But it's only sometimes not all the time."
"I feel like my body doesn't regulate temperature well in general, but particularly in the heat. I overheat really quickly and sometimes get heat rashes when it's in the 80s."
I have hyperhydrosis on hands and feet.
yesssss!
Thank you all for taking the time to respond! Glad to know I’m not alone.
"Both, I will be chilled when it's 78 degrees in the house or overheated when it's 72. I'm also perimenopausal, so whether it's Sjogren's, hormones, or both...I don't know."
"Most professionals have said that I shouldn’t have a sweat gland problem because of Sjögren’s, but I sweat HORRIBLY. It’s hard to manage, too, because most hyperhydrosis medications dry out mucous membranes and make the Sjögren’s symptoms worse. I have trouble regulating body temperature because of my Raynaud’s, which makes me cold, and I also will have flares where I will break out with a low-grade fever, sometimes multiple times a day for short periods of time. I get heat rashes very easily, too."
"This is me on a daily basis, unfortunately."
"Me too!  So sweaty....And since I have developed Sjögren’s, my sweat stinks like I’m eating garlic all the time. Although maybe it’s just changed smell so I don’t ignore it like usual."
"I have just come across this subreddit after a couple weeks now of persistent cotton mouth. I sweat like a beast while sleeping, I started literally covering myself with anti perspirant."

There is an amazing amount of symptoms about sjogrens that I have. I'll give it a month and if I'm still thinking about it then I'll ask my Dr.
Some onion cutting tips from a Sjögren's suffering ex cook:

#NAME?
#NAME?
"I tend to stay away from onions to start with, but I had a similar experience cleaning the shower with some chemical-containing product  - bathroom cleaning now requires a full-face respirator!"
"I just use frozen diced onions now. When I do cut them, I have to stop often and liberally rinse my eyes out. It’s horrible!"
"Yes!!! Oh my gracious,,,, it's TERRIBLE!"
"yeah i wear swimming goggles when i cut onions (if i have to, i buy frozen ready chopped ones as much as i can). It is truly the worst! feels like your eyes are gonna come right out your skull"
It’s just awful! What’s worse is when you cut onions with someone else in the kitchen and they are crying away while you just stand there with stinging eyes.
"Technique helps. After you halve the onion, never cut through the roots again. Your longitudinal cuts can stop short by less than an inch, similarly with the latitudinal cuts. Seriously! For some reason, less onion stinging chemical gas is produced when you don't cut through the root bulb. But it is less, not none."
"I was just diagnosed this year, but my symptoms started at 25 (will be 29 this month). Sjogrens has effected my autonomic nervous system with the worst symptoms being gastroparesis, orthostatic intolerance and constipation. I do have dry mouth and dry eyes along with everything else dry. Fatigue hits me terribly sometimes and I have exercise intolerance."

"Before getting into how it’s effecting my life I would like to say that this disease effects everyone differently. I have a lot of extreme complications that most women with Sjogrens don’t experience. Usually it’s dry eye, mouth and fatigue being the worst. Sjogrens.org is a wonderful place to check out with a diagram of all the symptoms that can happen."

"Every aspect of my life has been effected and I’ve had a tough time coming to terms with it. I work full time now, but I may have to drop to part time or go on disability. I have had to change my entire life and slow down a lot. I’ve had to forget some of my career goals and having  children gives me so much anxiety. I can barely function on my own some days."

"With all that said proper treatment can manage your symptoms. I suggest you to keep going to your doctors, try different products to help (Biotene and Vaseline are my favorites) and any medications you feel comfortable trying (I take plaquenil, which has helped my slow my symptoms and reduced my fatigue). You may never be the same, but you have to be open-minded and accept the things you cannot change!"
"It sounds like you and I are in really similar situations right now. I'm also 25F and just got diagnosed two weeks ago. I'm gathering that my case is a little odd for Sjogren's (or maybe just severe?) in that I have ""Sjogren's with neurologic involvement"". That means chronic fatigue, trouble focusing/remembering, anxiety, tingling in legs, migraines, and violent tremors. Symptoms started when I was just shy of 21, and got bad fast. I had to drop out of school and have not worked in four years. Two weeks on medications and I am almost 100% back to my former self. I'm awake the whole day, alert, and the neuro symptoms disappeared almost overnight. It has been life-changing. Trust your doctors and have hope. Modem medicine is a beautiful thing."
"1. Depending on your meds and routine, headaches and dry mouth will come and go. If I'm not militant about my eyedrops, or I miss a dose of my meds, the dryness comes back with a vengeance. And headaches are always up and down. I also have to be really vigilant about drinking water. If I forget, the headaches get way worse."

"2. I haven't tried that diet, but I've cut out a few food groups due to trial and error. I just see what works and what doesn't. Keep the good, toss the bad."

"3. I'm guessing by ""environment"" they meant either behavior or nature. How well you take care of yourself, or what your climate is like. Or both."

"4. I'm close to your age so I can't answer to the future as far as experience, but my doctor told me that Sjogren's is one of the less serious conditions, so there's that. Without knowing what kind of environment your job is in, it's hard to say if it will affect it. Also, I've heard that Sjogren's can vary a little person to person. So what's true for one may not be true for another. Unfortunately that's kind of the way it goes for autoimmune across the board. But the best way to combat that is to just keep reaching out like you did, so good on you."

"If you have more questions, don't hesitate."
"I was very lucky, and I basically put my SS into remission (which they say isn’t possible) for many years by going gluten free and eating better. Many people with SS don’t do well with gluten, even if they don’t have celiac. My first symptoms were peripheral nerve issues, and off and on swelling of the parotid when I was 19/20. I always had bad tension headaches as well, but I don’t know if that was related...maybe. No one knew what was wrong with me at the time, and I never even saw a rheumatologist. That was before AI disease was as big as it is now. I was just a mystery case. I went to an acupuncturist, since my regular doctor and neurologist were no help to me whatsoever and just ran pointless nerve studies on me and told me I had pinched nerves. The acupuncturist told me to stop eating bread (wheat) and to eat rice instead. I took his recommendation, and then cleaned up my whole diet and started exercising too. I did still eat wheat every once in awhile, but it was usually in homemade bread and small quantities. I stopped eating pizza, fast food, I stopped drinking, and stopped eating sugar. I did not have a thing wrong with me for 15 years. Now, I’m 38 and dryness issues have creeped up on me the last couple years, and a rheumatologist says I have this disease. I’ve been living with it in the periphery these years, and wish it would have stayed away for good 😐 So, we’ll see where I end up too, as I have a lot of years left as well."

"I do think there’s hope though. My husband has had ulcerative colitis for 10 years (while I was well, he was sick) and is in remission after going on the keto diet. He has taken imuran for several years, which def helped, but after a year of keto, he had a normal colonoscopy for the first time this year. Sorry for the novel, but just saying, never give up! I think medication and diet should be used together. I completely disagree with people who say AI cannot be helped with diet, because I’ve seen it. But I also think meds are beneficial. Good luck...25 is still so young, your body will respond quickly to any positive changes!"

"Eta: Also, I do wonder what role hormones have to play on SS. Almost all of my well years, I was either on birth control, pregnant (best I’ve ever felt), or breastfeeding. I have been on my own with normal hormones for the last few years, and that’s when these symptoms started. It’s too bad doctors never really address this hormonal aspect of it."
"Look into LDN, low dose Naltrexone.  There are Facebook groups with 30,000 plus members that can fill you in on the benefits for those with autoimmune issues."

"Keto diet made me feel better, but I think that had as much to do with avoiding sugar as anything."
"Yes, you can put your illness into remission with the right mix of drugs/diet/exercise/stress reduction, I have done this."

I do a modified paleo- like I can do dairy. You should start with AIP though and slowly reintroduce foods to see how you react. Get tested for celiac and have your thyroid checked.

"Environment - stress, ""toxins,"""

"I was diagnosed at 33 - crippling pain, allergies, headaches, sicca symptoms, anxiety/depression - took awhile but figured out my dietary triggers and stress, doing great now. Just finished an intensive masters program and am starting my first teaching job."

This was a fabulous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cdlvps/sjogrens\_survival\_supplies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cdlvps/sjogrens_survival_supplies/)
I see no one has commented. I have by my own diagnosis that I have has S for over 10 years. It’s not the worst autoimmune you can have. Mine started with the dry eyes “I use rostasis “ does help. I use a anti dryness toothpaste and mouth wash. Sugar free gun mints help. I possibly have lupus and Lyme. So my doctors are still testing. I have muscle aches and numbness and tingling in my feet. Feels like I have socks on when I don’t. I have not tried any diet plans yet. I just started using drops that I take it’s a root. I found out about it on here. I’m not at home at the moment but someone may know what I’m speaking of. If not I’ll add to this reply. I started taking a dropped full 10 days ago. And my eyes actually feel almost normal for once in years. Keep proper mouth care drink a lot of water. And good luck. I really don’t notice any horrible symptoms yet I’m 60 and female. On bad days I rest. But I really don’t have many. Hopefully others will comment. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Last year I had a massive flare going for months.

"Didn't eat for a month.  Flare went away.   Not a recommended technique, but clearly worked."

"Since then, I try hard to stay away from inflammatory food.   Definitely a strong relationship\[p between  food and how I feel.   Sugar, fried food, instant noodles  is the enemy."

There is research suggesting that fasting will reset the immune system.  Which is a cause for inflammation.
"For the environmental I think they are talking about where you were born and did at least part or your young childhood. Because with MS another autoimmune disorder you are more likely to get it if you were born in an area where there are 4 definite seasons,  with a lot of snow, also the time of year you were born with MS it is if you were born in the spring. It doesn't mean you can only get MS if you were born and raised in place like that, or you have to be born in the spring. It is just a lot more people tend to have that be true.  BTW    58 F"

"I have 2 sisters with MS, so that is why I am thinking that MAY be what they are talking about. I don't know what environmental things they are talking about with Sjogren's though."

"Actually all of my 6 siblings have one or more types of autoimmune disorders, so although it isn't hereditary the chances of other family members also having an autoimmune disorder is higher than your average person without any of these conditions. I also have 2 kids, both of them have these issues too."

"I can't say what happens as you age because I have other issues and I have no clue what is what. Reading about the headaches, that one is wow! I have always had one, I don't know what it is like for my head not to hurt. I had a birth defect that caused me to have bleeds in my brain, I never knew my migraines could also be from this. I just got my second set of Botox to try and get these under some sort of control."

"I have been dairy free for some years now, I only have eggs if they are mixed in to something, like cake, but I need to get rid of them all together. I am almost gluten free, but it is very hard. I don't think what is in something. I saw crackers, and went to buy them, oh no, those have real flour in it. And it is bad because I feel a little better when I don't have any gluten. I do good most times with that. Soy and fake sugars make me violently ill, so those were easy to give up. I need to get rid of that stupid coffee creamer, both the powered and liquid. I don't know about the AIP diet, I will have to look into it more. Who knows how old I was when this first hit me. Probably I remember my health getting worse when I was 21. Taking into account there can be huge differences with this, some only having the dry eyes, mouth and women vaginally, and others, it can be down right nasty. And yours may just very slowly get a little worse, where another person may get sick, but mostly bounce back. I'm the type that gets sick and that becomes the new me, no getting better. And every new I feel like crap, can't wake up for 2 days, means I'm a new feel like crap even more me..  I hope you are the kind that you can get to feeling pretty much better every time."
"My insurance won't cover amovig, or anything like that. They say it is still experimental, and until it has been on the market for over a year, it will not cover it. So it is Botox until them. This time it really seems to be helping a lot. I don't mind getting rid of the wrinkles as a side affect either Lol.  But I truthfully don't care if I have them or not.  I'm so glad the medication is working for you.  I slept so long I didn't know if it was morning or night and the new me feels like crap.  Maybe going back to be d will help, I'm so tired anyways."
"Your situation sounds very much like mine and it is so true that everyone experiences different symptoms. I agree with you wholeheartedly. And if I could add, not all medications or diets work for everyone. Try anything you can to see what works to help you cope."
"I'm so, so glad you're feeling better! Do you mind if I ask which medications you're taking that have turned things around for you?"
Thanks for the response! When you reincorporate food groups back in how long does it usually take to see if it causes a flare or not?
I will look into it! Thanks for the info.
That's awesome! So glad you're doing better and it's giving me a lot of hope.
Thank you! Please let me know the name of the drops when you have time!
Maybe not eating has something to do with the foods you eat normally. Once I started an anti inflammatory diet I had way less flare ups
Thank you for the info! I think I may try to do a 72 hour fast...
"Have you looked into the new anti-migraine shots (Emgality, Amovig, etc)? I started Emgality 4 months ago and it's completely eliminated my migraines *knock on wood*. It is extremely expensive though, unfortunately."
"Well for me, it's not so much of a flare thing as a serious digestive issue. I'm sure if I kept eating it, it would cause a flare too. But the stomach issues are enough to stop me from finding that out. So basically immediately. Sometimes, if it's gluten, it's like as soon as 30 minutes or less. But not everyone with Sjogren's has digestive issues, so this may not be a thing for you. Or it may take longer to test."
I found the bottle. Sorry I’ve been down with my back. They are called Equate comfort gel. It’s an eye lubricant. The sea buckhorn seed gel is amazing. You take a dropper full. So much better. Prayers. Oh my Restasis finally came in.
I'm sure that's part of it.

Standard disclaimer.  Let doctor know.
Let me know how it goes.
"I'm barely eating due to pain, but I do force myself so I don't get shaky and disoriented.  Would like to do a 72 hour, but I need to stay in bed the entire time to do it."
Awesome thank you for the info
Will keep you updated!
"I would say it depends on the severity of your symptoms. I'm diagnosed but that doesn't mean I don't produce any tears whatsoever. I do produce some. My eyes are just drier than ""normal""."

"I can cry when something really sad happens. I also sometimes watch sad videos on purpose to make a good amount of ""real"" tears once in a while."
"I'm so, so sorry about your cat <3."

"I have Sjogren's, and even though my eyes are dry and scratchy, I still cry (and _I cry a lot_). Sometimes I'll ""dry cry,"" which is really annoying, but most of the time tears come out -- granted, I caught my Sjogren's really early and got on Plaquenil months after my DX, so I don't have the most severe case in the world."

"Also, I find it's easier to cry on a nice humid summer day than in the winter, when I become a full-on desiccated husk :P"

"I hope you can get the health answers you need soon so you can start feeling better. You're dealing with a lot right now, and I hope good things come your way!"
"My dry eyes are quite severe and I can't cry at all. I mean, I can make ugly crying noises/faces, but no tears come out. It's really unsatisfying."
Sorry to hear about your furry family member. I am sero-positive (diagnosed Sjogren's based on blood test) and produce some tears. My oil component is lacking so the tears evaporate quickly.
"My symptoms are pretty severe, but more so my mouth. I can cry, but it's extremely painful and I suffer terribly afterwards. I avoid it at all costs. Luckily, I'm logical af and am not hormonal, so crying is rare."

I'm glad that you were able to cry though. I understand that some people enjoy it or feel a sense of relief. 🖤

"Edit: Btw, I'm so sorry about your cat. Mine passed this winter and that definitely left me crying a lot, even presently still."
Same. I hate it.
"My wife was recently diagnosed. My recommendation,  perhaps reach out to the foundation to see if they can recommend Sjögrens friendly doctors in your area. We are fortunate enough in our area to have a fantastic rheumatologist who actually referred my wife to ANOTHER local rheumatologist that understands Sjögrens. His reason for the specialty? “Everyone likes lupus and scleroderma so I figured I’d focus on Sjögrens. OP, where are you located?"
"I found a CNP who would actually listen to me. She's young and doesn't have a ton of experience, so she doesn't know all the answers and honestly that's been a huge help for my mental state. When I tell her I'd like something tested, she asks why while she's ordering the test. No more feeling like I'm fighting just to be believed."
"Still don't know everything that's wrong with me, but at least I don't have my doctor blowing it off as PCOS with the only symptom being that I'm overweight."
My suggestion is don’t walk into the appointment and state you think you have a particular diagnosis especially an uncommon one. Provide the symptoms and see if your doctor reaches the conclusion you suspect. If they don’t casually ask “what do you think about Sjögrens as a possibility?”.

Sounds much less like a hypochondriac.
"I'm currently in the same position, not yet diagnosed but I think I might have it. Had several blood works come back all negative, also had a genetic test from 23andme.com (paid it myself) showing up an increased likelihood of sjogren's. Eventually I got my eye doctor to suggest this, I was glad he brought it up so I felt safe to make another doctors appointment who is familiar with the disease. He then suggested further tests and I finally didn't feel like the usual hypochondriac for once, hurray. Are you aware of the fact that, according to different sources, about 30-40% of sjogren's cases are sero-negative, meaning it won't show up in your blood? Lip biopsy seems to be the gold standard, and I have my appointment scheduled for next week. I'm  super anxious whichever way it turns out :("
My eye doc is the one who first mentioned it.  I went to the doctor. He ran tests. All negative. I then began research and I wrote down every single symptom. My doc listened and is running further tests but said it is possible to be dx based off of symptoms. It is seronegative dx.
"After a year of symptoms and being passed around from all kinds of doctors to psychiatrists to treat each symtom separately, a nurse I had in the ER had mentioned that her son was in the same situation and she suggested the primary MD to run an autoimmune panel."

"I asked my doctor to run everything under the sun for autoimmune diseases since NO OTHER DOCTOR THOUGHT TO DO SO, and I was diagnosed with Sjogren's,  negative for Lupus. Took me about a year of hell before that happened. Now my Rheumatologist and I are besties 🤣"

I hope you find answers soon if you haven't already!
"Thanks for all the excellent suggestions.  Seriously, everyone has been very helpful ..we'll see how it goes!"
"Good luck with that, it's a nightmare. honestly fuck most of the Dr's out there. What I had to go through to get diagnosed and fighting against these MD's trying to make them believe me -- never again."
"Thanks, I'm in the Portland area.  I am beginning to see that I need to see a rheumatologist...all I have seen to this point is a family doctor.  They keep retiring or quitting, too!"
Lucky!  :)
"That is totally what I needed to hear.  Sounds like you understand where I am coming from.  Another thing I have learned is, don't bring up anything that can give a doctor the idea you might be depressed...some doctors love to run with that and put you on antidepressants as a cure for everything.  If you are depressed, fine, but it can give them the idea it's all in your head."
Good idea!  Or I could just say my eye doctor recommended I ask my g.p. about Sjogrens...sneaky!
"Ha!  I like your attitude...seriously, because that is honestly that is the way the whole medical community is these days.  Part of the problem is our whole healthcare system, the doctor's hands are tied so tight that it is no"
"longer an attractive job position.  Going to the doctor is like calling customer service when your internet is down...I swear they just have a checklist they go through and at the end, if nothing shows up, they say oh well, the problem must be on your end!  LOL!!!  Oh, and sorry you had such a hard time, how are you feeling these days?"
Yes. I definitely recommend seeking one in your area. Particularly one that understand Sjögrens. Good luck!!
I am! Only took 37 years too! Haha

"Honestly, looking for a non-Medical Doctor to start the process was one of the best things I've done. And someone on Reddit actually suggested it to me :)"
"Of course take all that with a grain of salt. I have sjogren's, but we haven't figured out why I can't eat solid food easily yet. She's actually just putting in a referral to Mayo Clinic and I hope they accept me! I've been having trouble eating since December and I've already lost 22% of my body weight since then. But that's the life of someone with autoimmune disorders a lot of times, unfortunately.... lots of waiting."
Yeah been through it all before. I work in healthcare too so I see both sides. Totally agree on the depression issue. I don’t have that problem but I see no good that can come from mentioning it unless you actually want to be given antidepressant medication. If they offer and you refuse the meds then it looks like you don’t want to make an attempt at getting better.
"that's particularly true for women, there are a lot of studies that show their symptoms tend to get dismissed and blamed on imagining it or just being depressed, stressed out, too emotional etc. Older male docs are the worst with this, they also assume they know everything because they have experience but often they actually are not up to date with current knowledge and just determined to be right... like someone else suggested here, a young doc might be a good idea, I usually go to women too."
"Exactly haha. I just mumbled something along 'my eye doctor just mentioned this possibility, what do you think?'. I don't even think my genetics report really helped, my doc just looked briefly at it and said that it's good to have this in the back of our minds, but of course genetic testing only tells you your increased risk, not whether you have it or not. And make sure to mention that your eye doctor or whoever also pointed out that mere blood tests are not enough to indicate sjogren's in some (actually, a lot!) cases."
Have you heard of gastroparesis? I have Sjogrens and it has effected my autonomic nervous system resulting in GI motility issues. I had a gastric emptying study which confirmed it. Not being able to handle solid food is a major symptom.
Thanks for the heads up about waiting...I'm not a patient person generally so I will try to be more relaxed about tests taking time!
I have considered that. I brought it up at the last appointment and it was after that that her nurse called me to say she wanted to do a Mayo Clinic referral. Thanks for your confirmation that it wasn't a bad suggestion on my part! :)
"Probably not the kind of mask you're inquiring about because you're likely looking for a sleep mask, but I'm going to post about this anyway because it looks like a mask and I love it."

"The Thermalon Dry Eye Moist Heat Compress provides instant relief and is especially good for people with evaporative dry eye. Heat it up in the microwave for 30 seconds and place it over your eyes. Makes the oil come out of the glands in your eyelids and keeps the glands unclogged for a bit. I use before bedtime, and sometimes during the day on particularly bad days. After the oil comes out, wipe away the debris with an eyelid wipe."

"The heat compress and wipes are available in the eye care section of some drug stores, and also on Amazon. The compresses are reusable and hand washable. I have two compresses so I can use one while the other is drying. after washing."
Do you use nighttime ointment in your eyes?
This mask has changed how well both my husband and I sleep. It's AMAZING. [EYE MASK](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001HTYJLO?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title)
I love the Slip silk eye masks! I have two and they keep my eyes covered from air but the silk it breathable. Because it’s silk it also won’t remove moisture from your face and eyes.
Click the word eye Mask and it takes you to the link of the one I suggested.  🙂

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001HTYJLO?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title
I use this kind (see link below) since it doesn’t put any pressure on my eyes and blocks out the light really well.  Sleep so much better with one on and my eyes don’t dry out during the night.  I am allergic to eye drops so this has been an eyesaver!!

[Sleep Mask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071HVBTK9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_7KbcDb8HPMRVV)
I use eco eye mask. It is wonderful.  It is for severe dry eye and for people with Sjögrens. Check it out. I believe it is [eco eye](www.ecoeye.com)
At this point I need to cover my eyes at night. I live in New Mexico the desert and it’s so dry. So it’s AC and fans which adds to the dryness.
Yes I use the Thera tears nighttime tears and then smear a little ointment on the eye lids. All preservative free which gives overnight relief
There’s ointment I’m supposed to use? Thank you
You didn’t give the brand of mask. There are so many out there. I hate the one I have  it’s very uncomfortable?
Thank unforeseen your reply. I ordered a fitglam  natural silk mask early this morning  will let everyone know how it works out. I used one not silk for a couple nights and didn’t wake up with a headache ya
Is the silk washable?
Seconding this. I sleep so much better with them. They are fantastic.
Thank you
Sounds perfect no pressure on the eyes
Fans are the worst. Are you using a humidifier by your bed to add moisture to the environment?
"You can buy it OTC at any drugstore. It'll be with the eyedrops, but it's labeled for ""severe"" dryness, and it's a night-time ointment. GenTeal, B&L, Refresh - they'll all have a version of the same thing. Usually made with petroleum jelly and mineral oil, and it's in a small tube, not a bottle."

"It literally saved my eyes. I was waking up with eyes so dry that my eyelid would be stuck to my cornea and rip bits of it off. Now I use that immediately before going to bed every night (it will blur your vision), and boom, problem solved. Still have dry eye during the day, but that stuff is amazing."
The link will give you all the details but the make is Brownmed.
Yeah my eyes don’t hurt in the morning and I can sleep better through the nigh!
"I hand wash with neutral pH soap, something along the lines of Woolite."
"Thank you! I just tried to go back to contacts after having LASIK years ago, I don’t know if it’s the place that got my RX wrong or having this disease, but they gave my incredible migraines and felt like I put broken glass on my eye. My eyes always seem to feel like that though."
Thank u for sharing I’m really looking forward to my new mask.
That's extreme dry eye for you. I'm sorry you're going through that. These night time drops will hopefully help.

"My ophthalmologist told me I'd dodged a bullet when, years ago, I almost had LASIK done and didn't because my corneas were so thin and dry. Can't imagine going through Sjogrens post-LASIK. Hope this helps, and definitely try out a heat mask, too. If it gets too bad, try scleral lenses. They're hard contacts that you fill with saline before inserting them in your eyes, and they work miracles. A bit tricky and very expensive, but a great investment in your vision."
"Great ideas, thank you so much."
"Sorry to hear what you're going through. Word of advice, is at all possible, try to figure out a strategy to eventually get away from your father. It's horrible how he's treating you and stress definitely impacts your health. Chances are, you'd start to feel much better after a while of being away from someone so toxic. You can google The mind-body connection, there are lots of books on it."
I definitely recommend cutting out gluten and dairy and eat as healthy as possible. It might help with a lot of pain.
"I think it's interesting how every one deals with this illness. I've found diet changes help and yeah cutting down on dairy is very helpful. I smoke weed, that helps immensely. But it can also impact my chest and it feels tight because I already have inflammation."

Massages help a lot. You would be surprised at how many of our physical symptoms can be caused by tense and tight muscles and muscle spasms. I take hot baths often and it's preventative and healing

Drink a ton of water. Stay away from excess sugar (like 25 grams a day and even that might be too much). Don't over work yourself. Sleep. Self care. All that jazz
"I have a lot of your symptoms. Muscle spasms that start in my left thigh, move to my right, then right arm, then left arm like around in a circle. My left knee, calf and foot when numb for about two months last year right before I found out I had Sjogrens. I suffered with Hashimotos Disease, (autoimmune hypothyroidism l) since I was nine. I was always very sick. Fatigue, recurrent strep throat, pharyngitis, laryngitis, chronic otitis media (ear infections) had to have multiple tube placements and those issues lead to 90% autoimmune hearing loss in my left ear. After being diagnosed with Hashimotos there were times I would be in stores and felt like I was going to pass out. Anytime I went into stores with flourescent lighting my eyes turned bright red. This is a symptom I suffer now, with Sjogrens and I wonder if I’ve had Sjogrens for a long time. Every tooth I have had a filling in it. I had all of them worked on after having my son at 17. A mouth full of metal dental cavities is terrible for you too. I’ve been to every kind of doctor. I have severe constipation. GERD. Recurrent lung infections. Misdiagnosed pink eye before I knew I had Sjogrens. Antibiotic drops did nothing so I now realize I needed a steroid because my eye was so swollen that I look like a monster. I’ve been tested for everything. Even celiac. My son is 14 now but back when he was 2 and 3 I suffered severe abdominal pain that put me in the ER many times and they could never figure out what it was except one time they found it was pancreatitis. Asked me if I drank a lot of alcohol and I do not. I believe now it was autoimmune. Around that time I was really sick and was tested for the bird flu that was going around and it came back negative. I now believe it was a flare up. I’ve been tested for Lyme disease, I’ve had nerve conduction tests, MRI’s anything, you name it. I have a problem with dehydration and feel I never can drink enough water. I’ve suffered many UTI’s and as of recently I will get what feels like a UTI, but it will pass. I think I get temporary inflammation in my bladder and urethra. I’ve had a stressful week and am having a flare up with a headache, severe fatigue and blurry vision. I have had an SSD application ongoing for four years and was just denied. I am bipolar i, with obsessive compulsive tendencies, PTSD, intermittent explosive disorder, anxiety, panic attacks, and an unspecified personality disorder, they told me my Sjogrens and other issues aren't severe enough however if you read through the disability guidelines when you have two autoimmune disorders that lead to other issues like chemical imbalances in the brain that can cause anxiety and bipolar you are supposed to be approve. See the problem was I had an asshole psychologist that I met one time and he noted I appear to have nothing wrong with me. He totally fucked me. So I have to refile for SSI and I will be approve but am screwed out of 4 years of back pay. No one wants to fight it because there are other things in my record that do not look good like things that happened when I was manic- got into drugs - self medicated my own pain - things like that. It's been a very hard road and it's hurtful for people to point out like there was a picture on my Facebook that I cooked dinner. I do have days where I am able to do things like this but still struggle. Before I found out about the Sjogrens I literally could not function or move from a chair. The headaches, the eye pain and redness and blurry vision, the muscle pain and weakness, thank God for Prednisone! I see a new doctor here in my city we have an entire network of Autoimmune specialists. (Pittsburgh had some of the best doctors) I am also seeing a new rheumatologist. I am constantly judged because of my age (31) and prior history. You know the history where I kind of gave up on how shitty I've felt my whole life on top of traumatic things that happened which led me to toxic relationships that added to my PTSD. I also get a light buttery fly rash on my face. I get short of breath too and I believe that I have lupus and I am hoping my new Dr gets to the bottom of it. Today is bad, my vision is blurry can't keep my eyes open, no appetite, soreness in my left hand and wrist with shooting pains, and I can't find my damn glasses. Ugh! Wish you the best but just wanted you to know you aren't alone! I also would like my adrenals tested cause I get energy at night. I couldn't wake up early enough to get the cortisol test tho."
"I’ve had symptoms now for years and years, but always just chalked it up to living in a dry climate. My mother has Sjogren’s and also Lupus, diagnosed nearly a decade ago, and my only paternal aunt has MS and immunoglobulin issues, so I became immediately and acutely aware of my possibility for autoimmune issues to begin cropping up, I just didn’t think it’d be this soon (just turned 30). That’s been the hardest part to digest, I think."

"Symptoms: dry, red eyes that never fully clear, plaque psoriasis that comes and goes, severe constipation (I rely on things like Miralax almost daily, and give myself a water enema whenever things have gotten so backed up that I’m in physical pain), heat intolerance to the extreme, extreme fatigue that comes on shortly after I’ve woken up and lasts all day, random bouts of low-grade fevers, and occasional ovarian cyst ruptures that have me doubled over and couch-bound, and random spasms, twitches, and numbness in my arms and hands."

"I finally went to see a PCP about all of my issues and he ran a full panel, ruled out MS and IgG issues, but my rheumatoid numbers and symptoms have gotten much worse since my last blood draw a couple years ago. Because I’m still officially under the parameter line (by one single point), he’s not concerned. Disheartened is an understatement in my regard. So I just go on progressively getting a bit worse over time until I go back in for more bloodwork."

"I totally understand not being heard or believed by other people regarding when symptoms are flaring so you can’t do the things you want to do. I understand the severe GI issues and everyone just telling you to drink more water, it’ll fix it (it doesn’t). I understand the severe fatigue that you deal with, and the random fevers that crop up. You are very much not alone in this."
"Look up cystic fibrosis. It sounds like you could be a carrier of the delta F508 chromosome and one other CFTR gene which would mean you have the disease but it’s not as severe. I know this because I’m a cystic fibrosis carrier and have very, very mild symptoms. I also am in the process of getting screened for an autoimmune disease by a rheumatologist."

The reason why I think this is that your story sounds similar to Alexandra Nowakowski. She has Sjogren’s and Cystic Fibrosis and was diagnosed later in life. Here’s a link to an article she wrote that chronicles her health.

[link](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/better-late-than-never-on-being-diagnosed-with-cystic-fibrosis-at-33/)
You don't find that weed affects your dryness in your mouth or eyes?
Yes to all of this! I get heart palpitations from weed sometimes - do you ever find that? How do you cope with the tight chest? I haven't yet found a solution.
"I'm really struggling to cut back on dairy. I've been gluten free for 7 years but dairy is hardest for me to quit. Do you cut out absolutely all dairy? Do you know the overall impact on how you feel from quitting dairy vs gluten by any chance? (Yeah, I'm totally trying to find ways to continue rationalizing not quitting dairy haha)"
"I can’t thank you enough, you may have saved my life, and my sons. We are being tested very soon for CF, he’s had signs since birth but I wasn’t sure how to explain his issues accurately and was often dismissed “toddlers get sick”."

"Personally since making this post my health has deteriorated rapidly. I can hardly do my job now, I can hardly eat anything and have developed increasing issues with breathing and somehow even more frequent illness than my already frequent amount prior, I get sick more than my 2 year old. Way more. And blood tests show a good immune system. My nails have gotten dramatically worse, I’ve developed amenorrhea with the occasional light period, medications aren’t fixing it yet. But I’m horribly sick again with  what I think is a sinus and lung infection right now, for no reason other than I camped in a tent with plenty of blankets in an insulated garage. And it didn’t get that cold either... And my son, is somehow only mildly if at all sick, it’s just his wheezing and cough he’s always had no matter what, the doctors never freaking looked into it even with my badgering and strong concern for it’s abnormality, but it suddenly reminded me of this comment I only got to glance at and forgot to return to due to being busy with my son."

I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart. ❤️
I've been doing it so long it doesn't as much anymore. I use a water pipe with hot water so the steam helps moisturize when I do it. Chewing gum with xylitol is a major help because it stimulates saliva production.
"I am able to cry, but the after effects are horrible - I will have swollen eyelids, burning pain, etc and need to do cold compresses to calm it down. Last time took me 2 days to feel back to normal."

"For what it’s worth, I find it cathartic enough to sob without tears."
"I don't have an answer for you, but just wanted to give you some moral support :) it's great to keep posting questions-- this community is so helpful :)"
"Nope, not able to cry. Sounds like a good thing but it is so weird!"
"I wish I could cry, truly!"
well sometimes im not able to. crying without tears is...weird xD . im mostly not able to in times where i have severe pain in my joints.
Sometimes it works out but while crying i have incredibly burning pain and super swollen eyes.

"so crying makes no sense for me anymore lol. Tbh sjogren makes me so tired and drains all my energy, that it makes me numb . :D"
"I'll speak up as another one who's not been able to regain it, and this has been going on for ten years. I have only recently been diagnosed and started seeing a rheumatologist though, so I'm trying to be hopeful that this could change. My rheumatologist didn't inspire the most confidence at my first appointment, but I also got a spot in a Sjögren's-specific program and will go at the end of July. Fingers crossed."

"I also learned about this device from this sub, and plan to bring it up at my next appointment. Might be snake oil, but I'm willing to try anything at this point: [https://www.truetear.com/](https://www.truetear.com/)"
"Ironically, the first sign for me was dry eye, which was actually the wettest eye ever. It felt as though I had paper cuts across my eyeballs, and tears were so painful! I've never lost the ability to cry, thank God, because I find it to be a tremendous release."
"I'm worried this may happen to me but at the moment I can still cry. I do get sore eyes after though. My main problem is day to day moisture for eye movements, grit removal and washing any foreign substances out like shampoo. If I lose the ability to cry on top of that I won't be too bothered to be honest. It's more the health related things that make life more difficult that would upset me most."
"I can cry when I get really upset, like recently when my elderly dog passed. I cried for hours - with actual tears. It's the pain after that is even worse though. I feel like it made my eyes and sinuses flare up. They are still stinging and burning days later."
"I agree. If I am able to cry, my eyes sting terribly. It comes and goes, though."
"Yikes, I'm so sorry!"
"Same here! Usually the compresses help, but it takes days for the swelling to go down."
Thank you! I've found it so.
Thanks for the video.
Thanks for the link!

Glad you liked
The honest answer? Vyvanse and Adderall. Seriously life changing for me. I have a very high-powered high-stakes job where I need to be on my A-game constantly.

"If you frame your fatigue in a way that is significantly depleting your quality of life and work, preventing your focus, most doctors won’t hesitate to give it to you."

"Other than that, diet. You need to be on point with what you’re putting into your body. Tons of water, no gluten, no dairy. Good supplements like Vitamin D, B12, iron,"

"Sleep. Lots of consistent sleep and a ritual that helps you relax and release the stress of the day. Working out, yoga, bubble baths. Sleepy tea, lavender pillow spray, melatonin."

"Also, take it easy. Some weekends I just lay in bed and watch TV. Save your energy when you can."
"I have gone through phases of doing well and not doing well. I have Sjogren's as well as mild-moderate POTS, mild-moderate Ehlers-Danlos, and Hashimoto's."

"Pacing. Know your activity limits and try to stick to them. For me, I experience a form of what I'm guessing is post-exertional malaise. If I do too much one day, I might suddenly ""crash"" partway through the day. Or, I might not actually feel the fatigue until a day or two later, where I can barely get out of bed. Planning for this and trying to space out activities instead of cramming them into one day helps a lot."

"Give yourself permission to take breaks, even if they seem ridiculous. I have been known to sit on display chairs at Target for good chunks of time while shopping, or sit on a curb while taking a walk, or turn my breaks at work into shut-eye breaks with noise cancelling headphones on (set the music to a playlist of something calming and then something that will wake you up at the end)."

"If you are able, use services to give yourself a break. Uber and Lyft if you are too sleepy to drive, Uber Eats or pizza delivery if you really can't cook, Instacart for groceries, etc. I use these pretty sparingly but they are a great resource."

"I also tone down my activities in general, or find ways to make things less fatiguing. One really good one - use a chair. I have a chair next to my bathroom counter, and I sit while doing makeup or other beauty/self care things. I have been known to bring my chair in the kitchen, and sit to prep and cook (a stool or drafting chair is best for high counters). I also sit while putting away laundry."

"Another trick is to combine low-energy days with calm work days. I work a desk job as well as a work-from-home side job. On my fatigued days I will work on my side job when I get little spurts of energy. I keep my laptop on a little cart next to my bed and work completely laying down, with several pillows propping up various body parts."

"I also adjusted my hobbies. I used to love to go on very long walks, but I can't handle this as much anymore. Instead, I take walks around my neighborhood, so I'm never too far from my house. It got boring, so I started playing Pokemon Go again to have something to look forward to while walking."

"I also play a lot of open-world video games, again usually while laying down. I keep a lot of water, eye drops, and a humidifier nearby."

"Fine tuning your medication is important. For me, I have to take my medication an hour or two before bed, or they make it hard for me to get up in the morning. Also, take supplements if you need them. Fish oil has helped me a lot. Get a blood test to check out your vitamins and minerals and correct anything that might be low, like vitamin D."

"Be sure you're staying hydrated however you can. Plain water doesn't always do it for me, so I mix my own electrolyte drinks using lite salt (salt and potassium, it's at the grocery store with other salts), magnesium (Natural Calm), and some flavoring like lemon juice or sugar free syrup (e.g. Raspberry Torani). I try to avoid excess sugar but sugar free Powerade is also really good."
"To be honest, I know this isn't going to be able that everyone likes or can take, but I've just had to get a lot better at minimizing stress."

"For me, a large part of that was quitting my very stressful job. For the foreseeable future I'm a house spouse and focusing on myself. I understand that I'm in an incredibly privileged position to be able to do that and that not everyone can or even wants to do that. I never thought that I wanted that for myself. My spouse and I had some very honest conversations about what was important to both of us and came to the conclusion that while the money and security that my job gave us was very nice the stress my job gave me far outweighed the benefits."

Since quitting my fatigue has been far more manageable even though I definitely physically do more work than before. The mental and social load I was taking on at work was that high. I also get the freedom to move things around to accommodate good days and bad days.

"Another thing that I've had to do is be really circumspect about the extraneous things that I allow myself to take on. For example I'm a volunteer at a local nonprofit, and while I feel like I'm qualified to do more than I'm doing now I simply know that if I take on more than what I'm already doing then I won't be able to do it reliably and still take care of myself. I have to reserve extra time to take care of myself that I don't always need but sometimes is essential."

The last big thing is that I try to swim at least twice a week. There's a local indoor pool that I pay for access to that has aquatic aerobics and water yoga classes that have been excellent for my horrible joints and have been an excellent way for me to get into better shape without risking injuring myself.
"I also have ADHD, so Vyvanse. Your rheumy might be willing to prescribe a stimulant if your fatigue is really bad, though."
I can echo what most other folks have said for the most part.

"Pacing (have you read about ""spoon theory""?) is key. The next biggest thing is forgiving yourself."

"As far as medications and supplements, try to avoid any that make you more fatigued. I have painful neuropathy on top of sjorgren's. I've found that tramodol is effective to some degree, but it makes my fatigue so much worse. I had it almost under control between pacing and supplements, and that all went to hell when I started tramodol (and now I can't stop it cold turkey because I've developed a dependence - it only took like 2 months!)"

"Be aware of dysautonomia, its way more common in sjorgren's folks than most people realize. Orthostatic intolerance and POTS can contribute to feelings of fatigue. You can boost your salt and potassium intake (if you can swing it try Nuun electrolyte tablets - take two in some juice sometime and see if it makes you feel any better - otherwise try gatorade, pedialyte, or just putting some sea salt in some juice and drinking it). If you read about it, and think you might have it, or find that electrolytes help, a tilt-table test is the best way to get a firm diagnosis. There are a few drugs that can affect your blood pressure that your doctor might prescribe that can help. I take florinef, its a hormone that makes your body hold onto salt, and it puts a minor dent in my sumptoms, when I remember to take enough extra salt."

"So beyond that, when things are"
"really bad, I take modafinil (provigil). Depending on your doctor and insurance (and where you are in the world) it might be easier or harder to get than something like adderal. I buy it without insurance at Costco (its like 45 bucks). The up side of it compared to typical ADHD drugs is that it doesn't give you withdrawl symptoms. Its easy to take a day or two off or just take it as needed like I do. In fact, you can avoid tolerance buildup by taking frequent breaks (my doctor told me to take a day or two off every 7-10 days). Its weird stuff, so be careful with it, but it has a really good safety profile. Avoid other stimulants like caffeine if you can while on it - if I'm not careful I can end up with major insomnia (what's weird about it is that its not insomnia in the sense of ""I'm frustrated because I'm tired but can't sleep"" its more like ""sleep!"
"I don't need no stinkin' sleep"")."

"Supplements are my main defense against my autoimmune and pain-related fatigue. I take caffeine in the form of cold-press coffee concentrate I make myself (its my morning coffee, usually just need it once a day). I add l-theanine, it seems to 'round out' the caffeine effects, makes things less jittery."

"Along with that, I take B-12, NALT, magnesium l-threonate, and citicoline. Especially with the caffeine, it's a nice, mild stack. First thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. I wait maybe 2 hours before I have my coffee. I'll have another dose of everything but the coffee and magnesium around 3pm if I need it. I take a break from it for a few days when I need to rest or if its been 5-7 days of using it in a row."

"I've taken a handful of other useful nootropics/supplements that work well (phenylpiracetam, sulbutitamine, and alpha-gpc with uridine in particular), and occasionally add them if I need to really push back the fatigue, but nothing beats my usual stack so far."

"I struggle to get proper sleep, I think managing that is key as well to fight the fatigue. I tend to get so dry at night my mouth and  nose get inflamed and it wakes me up, or it triggers my sleep apnea. In either case my fatigue ends up being way worse in the morning. Sleeping with a humidifier helps a lot."

"Also for sleep is magnesium. I supplement it at night sometimes, but I've found that the magnesium 'oil' applied to my arms and legs is helpful as well (its great for tight muscles)."
>Vyvanse

"Adderall fixed my fatigue. Doctor switched me to Vyvanse few days ago.  Had a bad panic attack from it, so I might switch back.  He's saying to give it a few more days"
Thanks for sharing. It's the first time I've heard someone use the word 'crash' in the same way that I do. I had so many of those moments before I got tested positive for SSA-antibodies. I used to study full time and had a casual job that I could cram into any spare time I had (working late up to 1am after my classes). Then I failed a subject and decided to finish the final year part-time but I felt like I was being lazy by doing this so I got a second casual job. It was insane and I would go at full force for 2 or 3 days and have days where I slept 14hours and then spent all day in bed. When I told my friends I keep 'crashing' they laughed it off and though I was just eccentric (which I didn't mind). The hardest part of fatigue for me is slowing down because I feel like I need a good reason to not push myself. Also the closest friends/family not truly understanding how it feels to be so tired every morning that I need to sit down to brush my teeth is a bit lonely. They have been very considerate but I don't want to make them always worry so sometimes I don't tell them how I'm feeling.
I've only been on this subreddit for a while but all the experiences and advices that people have shared has done more for me than all my medical consultations so far. So thank you all :)
"That's interesting, is Vyvanse effective for you?"

Fatigue is the worst symptom for me but I know compared to other people it might be not be as severe as it could be. It's just that being fatigued day after day while trying to maintain your lifestyle gets exhausting and it makes me wonder how other people deals with it.
Wow thanks for sharing such a detailed regime. I really wasn't even considering any vitamins or supplements as a serious option because I really wasn't sure where to even start. I have been on nootropics before (friend recommended me during my studies and I used it for only about a 1/2 year) and the effects were overall very positive.

There are so much things I still don't know about Sjogren's! I have been seriously wondering for about 3 years why I have suddenly been getting orthostatic hypotension. I'm still in my 20s (blood pressure was average 120/80) and I couldn't possibly think of why I would get so light-headed (to the point where I am blinded for 5seconds with a bright flashing light) when I stand up from a prolonged crouching position. In the last 3 years I have been getting my blood pressure measured (at least 3-4times a year) but since last year my BP average was 100/80 and a couple of times during the periods where I feel weak and nauseous it even went down to 98/80 which I never observed before. It's great to know what to look out for and how to manage the symptoms. Thank you so much for the insight.
"Had same issues, no panic attacks with Adderall."
"Definitely. I hate how hard it is to explain to people. I'm not being lazy - I want to go back to running 100 mph all the time. I miss the days where nothing could stop me and all I needed was coffee and a few hours of sleep. It's very frustrating to feel like ""maybe if I just worked harder I could do it"", trying it, and realizing again that it's still not true."

"I agree, Sjogren's and chronic illness in general can be so lonely."
"I can't focus without it, because, well, ADHD. But sometimes I'll take a break from it on the weekends. The days when I don't take it I end up napping off and on all day, and I am not a fan of naps, but I clock 16-18 hours of sleep those days. With it, 7, just at night."

"Before I started using it I thought I'd have to give up driving because I would think ""I'm just going to close my eyes for a few minutes"" while driving 75 mph on the interstate."
75.0 mph ≈ 120.7 km/h ^(1 mph ≈ 1.61km/h)

"I also have profound, debilitating fatigue. The only things I have found to be helpful are amphetamines like Vyvanse. However, for me vyvanse often causes stomach pain, nausea, and a high heart rate. It’s definitely not ideal, but for me it’s the only thing that can get me out of bed on bad days."
"I also take 1600 mg daily of the supplement SAM-e, which has given me a small but definitely noticeable boost of energy."
Cutting inflammatory foods has helped with my sleep and fatigue. Have you tried any diet changes?
[deleted]
I’m female and I battle my fatigue with B Complex vitamins. They seem to be working.
I take vitamin d and b every morning and put d ribose powder in my water. I feel like the combo helps.
"Sjogren's is associated with deficiencies in vitamin D, B12 and iron. I would definitely recommend taking supplements!"

"\(and while you are at it, maybe try fish oil and tumeric? worth a try\)"
"My wife has Sjrogrens and takes Provigil for her fatigue. If you have checked your vitamin levels and they are fine then I would look into either Provigil or Nuvigil. Personally, I take Nuvigil because it works better for me. I hate the ""throw a pill at it"" mindset but it sounds like you need something to help you asap and Provigil or Nuvigil could be a God-send. They are for me and my wife. GL!"
"Ask your Dr. About upping steroids for a little bit. My main Sx is fatigue and brain fog, now managed with 5mg steroid, 1.5 pill of praquinel and 20mg leflunomide."
"Just realize that fatigue is a reaction to the energy you expend in both creating and healing from this disease. If you push yourself into depleting your energy beyond what you can keep up with, I imagine that would be really stressful for your body."
"When I lived in California, they gave me Ritalin without blinking. Now I live in Pennsylvania, and they tell me to go to the psychiatrist for that. While I understand amphetamines aren't exactly the go-to for most physicians, I don't think many of them understand what it's like to experience true fatigue, not just being ""tired."" One doctor prescribed Provigil, which isn't as addictive. It worked okay."
Can I get perscribed vyvanse for sjogrens? When I asked my doc about getting something for the fatigue she told me to take b12
I haven't tried a diet change but honestly its because I don't ever have an appetite
"Yeah, my D level was 28.   Taking 4000iu daily now."
I'll give those a shot. My doctor mentioned b12 helping
Ive not tried taking any of those othet than b12
"If you fear a deficiency, it's a really good idea to be tested first. Taking supplements can raise blood levels even when it's not getting into the tissues."


"Btw, most people feel their best with a B12 serum level above 600 pg/mL in case your doctor tells you at 400 you're in the safe zone. Fully half of people with B12 at 550 or below are deficient. This test has a really high false negative rate."
Do i just ask my doctor to check my vitamin levels? And do i just bring up that ive heard of nuvigil
"You’re absolutely right that doctors don’t understand what true fatigue is. It took me a very long time to find a PCP and rheumatologist that really believed me when I explained how debilitating it can be. I was also prescribed provigil, but my insurance company wouldn’t approve it because I didn’t have narcolepsy. After months of fighting with them I just gave up and asked my doctor for something else. For some reason my insurance is okay with vyvanse."
Did Ritalin help with concentration and memory symptoms?
Take a look into modafinil
"Yes you can, but it’s definitely not their go-to drug so they’ll first recommend a bunch of other things. B12 did nothing for me at all. Then we tried wellbutrin, which also didn’t have any noticeable effects. If you explain that your fatigue is seriously disabling, hopefully they’ll keep trying new things til they find what works for you"
"You may want to try the route of going to a sleep clinic first. Sometimes, the doctors there will prescribe amphetamines for debilitating fatigue. If nothing else, they may confirm the debilitating nature of your fatigue to your other doctor(s)."

I take Adderall for my fatigue.
"You should check out AIP. Being gluten free has made a huge impact on my fatigue and removing nightshades and red meat helps keep me pain free. I also upped my good fats, vitamin D, magnesium. Sea buckthorn, an Omega 7, is great for our sicca symptoms. Epsom salt baths or a spray before bed is great for sleeplessness."

I have my life back and am feeling great. My ANAs were negative at my last doctor's appointment.
"If B12 supplements seem to give you energy, it's only because you're seriously deficient. [https://www.b12deficiency.info/](https://www.b12deficiency.info/)"
"B12 only helps if you're deficient in it. If you get any kind of euphoric feeling after taking a good, strong B12, then you know you have a serious deficiency. www.B12info.net"
"For better absorption of iron:  DO take it with vitamin C,  DO NOT take with calcium or caffeine."
Tumeric is best combined with black pepper.

Best of luck! I hope this helps you.
"As far as b12, Vitamin D, and a few others, yes, you can ask your doctor to order blood work to get your levels checked. My wife's (who has Sjogrens) vitamin D was so low that they really couldn't give a true level. It just said something along the lines of ""too low to test."" Her b12 was incredibly low as well. I have Dysautonomia/MVP and I take B12 shots 2x/week. 1cc of cyanocobalamin each shot. I have noticed a huge difference in my energy levels from the b12. I probably wouldn't be able to get out of bed without my Nuvigil though. And for Nuvigil, yes, you should bring it up to your doctor. I'm surprised that your doctor hasn't brought it up already. You can tell your doctor that you did some research and found that people with excessive daytime sleepiness/fatigue take Nuvigil or Provigil. They are both commonly prescribed for EDS/F. I hope this helps!"
It definitely helped with concentration. I can't recall if it helped with memory (how ironic). I just remember being able to actually stay awake and retain information for the first time in a long time.
dysautonomia

It’s a symptom of Sjögren

It has a LOT of symptoms on its own.
Temperature regulation being one of them

Do you have trouble sweating?
"I know this is a frustrating answer, but I'd ask your doctor. I've personally not had sudden temp changes, but I do have random fevers and I will go from cold to hot very quickly with exertion."

"One of the most irritating things about autoimmunity is that it seems like the pool of potential symptoms is really broad, so theres really no way to tell how your meds might effect you other than the most common symptoms that we know about."
"I have this as well. I asked my doctor a while back and he said a number of his sjogrens patients report hot flashes. Mine are particularly bad at night, and I find sleeping with ice packs helps. I’ve had them going on 2 years now."
"I experience this as well. I'm in my 30s, and my gyno does not believe it's premenopause."

"Do you sweat a lot, too? I sometimes will in these sudden hot moments."
"I'm so thankful for this question and the responses.  I've been trying to figure this out myself.  I've been through plenty of hormone testing all of which came back unremarkable. No answers from doctors, but reassuring it's not just me."
"20, have been experiencing this too in the past year, and I also feel the cold more intensely than the people around me. I also feel parts of me burning at times, does anyone else experience this?"
I get this symptom about an hour after I take cevemaline. Every time with out fail.
Wow thanks. I’ll get hot and it’s 70 in my house. I’ll be freezing at 80. My friend has MS and she gets this way too. I sometimes thinks it a flair up. It could last all day and then it’s gone the next. I can remember evenings where I would have to take a bath just to warm up in the middle of summer. I’ll talk to my DR about it. Thanks.
Experiencing these the last 2 years. First I was told Menopause(45) sure ok yeehaw but no lolol menstrual cycle just as on time. I've been on plaquenil 4 months now. Diagnosed Sjongrens and Reynauds about 15 years ago and they added RA this year even tho blood still neg. Otherwise I'm freezing constantly and I won't sweat unless I'm literally doing my run in the heat of the day at 114 heat index.
"I also want to know if anyone has weird breakouts at joints. Elbows, fingers and now toes. rheumatologist said these aren't part of a flare and to see a dermatologist. They come and go but for months at a time. And look a bit like a wart. Don't itch or burn but hurt like dammit when you smack them."
"I started getting hot flashes in my mid-40s, and I wasn't diagnosed with Sjogren's for another 15 years. It is more likely that it is just perimenopause. What you describe matches exactly what my hot flashes were like."
"I don't have trouble sweating, but I do have other symptoms related to dysautonomia. Looks like I have another thing to talk to my Dr about. Thanks for the info!"
I do get sweaty
"I definitely am having sweating problems.  And I think my body chemistry has changed, since my sweat smells stinky like rotting onions to me.  Used to be that even if I worked out enough to get drenched in sweat, I couldn’t really smell it/ didn’t smell bad (because I was used to my own smell; I’m not used to this new smell). I get hot and cold unrelated to temperature ーover all I feel better in the cold.  45*F and rainy is about perfect for me."
"Yup. Sometimes my body just feels all out of wack and can't regulate temperature. I'll sweat profusely over a short walk in the summer. Also, I've started to feel burning and pain in my extremities when I have a flare."
"Upon rereading, I noticed you said that. Sorry about that. I don't have answers, but you aren't alone!"
"Hi! I have Sjogren’s and I gave birth to a healthy boy last August. I found it reassuring that the chance of heart block is pretty low. I think I remember my doctor telling me that if they haven’t detected one by 20 weeks, then the chance of your baby having a heart block is super rare. Make sure you have a good MFM doctor - they’ll check you every two weeks up to a certain point and also do a fetal echo. It also helps if your MFM and regular Ob are in communication so that each office is aware of the tests the other is doing."

"Even though it was annoying to go to the doctor every two weeks, I loved getting to see baby on the sono so often. It was nice to just have that reassurance that everything was going okay throughout my pregnancy."

"As for my Sjogren’s, I found that everything went kind of “quiet” during pregnancy - most of my symptoms were drastically reduced while I was pregnant, and then got worse for a bit postpartum, which I think is typical of most autoimmune disorders. Everything normalized by 6 months after I gave birth."

"Also, my doctors wouldn’t let me go over 40 weeks because of my Sjogren’s. Since I hadn’t gone into labor by 39 weeks, I was scheduled for an induction at 39+5. I was induced for around 48 hours, but I still hadn’t gone into labor, so I had to have a C-section. Everything actually went very smoothly and we were home 4 days later."

"I’d be happy to answer any questions that you have. And congratulations! I’m excited for you, motherhood is so awesome. :)"
"Hi! I was diagnosed in 2015, we already had 2 daughters so I super adamant that we not have anymore kids after my diagnosis. Life of course has other plans, & I got pregnant even with birth control! Around 20 weeks, my MFM doctor referred me to a pediatric cardiologist who could do sonograms. They did find a flow issue, but the cardiologist insisted it was normal & shouldn’t be too much of a concern. So obviously I lived in terror the next 20 weeks, but my OB, MFM, & the cardiologist kept reassuring me everything was okay & the issue eventually corrected itself. I went into labor naturally around 38 week & gave birth to a beautiful & totally healthy baby boy. The cardiologist evaluated him as soon as he was born & his heart was perfectly normal. His discharge paperwork read “unremarkable baby boy”.  I never thought unremarkable would be the best way someone could describe my baby, but I cried tears of joy when I read that, lol. He’s 2 now, still no issues. The worst part of the whole ordeal was the inconvenience of practically living at the doctor’s office."

Congratulations! Make sure you take your prenatals & I’m sure your baby will be completely unremarkable too! ❤️ (I assure you it’s the best way to be described in medical terms)

"Edited to add this: I will agree with another user that my symptoms were in remission during pregnant, but did flare up after birth."
Hi! One kiddo before dx and one after. The latter did start showing some signs of “possible” concerns. I went on steroids for the remainder of the pregnancy and being scanned weekly at a pediatric cardiologist at Cincinnati children’s which is world renowned so I felt super secure and safe. Boy was born at 38+2 perfectly healthy! Just turned 7 yesterday. With my other health issues + Sjögren’s we chose no more children.

"Edited: forgot an important part! I did get gestational diabetes from the steroids but just monitored sugars and everything was great! I actually left MFM @36 weeks after cerclage removal to deliver VBAC with my family doc, it all worked out perfectly but we chose not to tempt fate again."
"Glad you brought the question up as I've had the same concerns.  I'm positive for SS-A and SS-B.  Not pregnant, but considering it one day, hopefully. Talked to my rheumatologist about pregnancy last week.  She brought up that yes I'm at greater of neo-natal heart block, but she said the best thing to do is to make sure the doctors know and can monitor."

"She didn't advise me not to get pregnant, but said I'd need to make sure I can be under care of doctors."

Sounds like you're on the right track.  Congrats on the pregnancy.
"I gave birth to twins. I was diagnosed during that pregnancy. I was pretty scared too. But my kids are great and healthy. They prescribed me the plaquenil and baby aspirin. I had crazy nose bleeds from the aspirin. Light headedness. But other than that, everything was fine. Glad they’re taking care of you so well!"
"I’m not pregnant, but I plan to be within the next year or so and this is constantly on my mind. I’m curious have you tested positive for any antibodies? I’ve been reading that the SSA and SSB antibodies are what puts your baby at risk. If you are negative I think the risk is much lower. Although the highest percentage I could find is 8% in mothers who are Ro-Positive (SSA)."
I didn't know that if it wasn't detected by 20 weeks the risk drops. That's really reassuring thank you! I'm glad to hear you had a good experience. It's easy to scare yourself on the internet!

"And my autoimmune diseases have been just the same really, no temporary remission for me yet"
"I needed to see this. I got scheduled with my MFM for the echo & anatomy scan ultrasound today for October 1st. I'll be 17 weeks then & even though I knew this would happen before I got pregnant, it still freaked me out."
My symptoms were completely in remission during both of my pregnancies. Best I ever felt lol
Yeah I saw a consultant for prepregnancy assessment and they were quite optimistic. But once you actually get pregnant and you're going to all these scary appointments it's a lot more real. I've had fantastic care from my NHS hospital and the doctor's looking after me have been so knowledgeable and wonderful. I have the first cardiac scan in 2 weeks and crossing my fingers all goes okay.
"I am positive for both, sadly. I'm basically textbook seropositive sjogren's. I am a high risk pregnancy although they put my on hydroxychloroquine a year ago so hopefully that will help. They told me it's a 2% chance of heart block and a 0.5% risk of loss of the baby."
"I’m glad if my post was able to help. Please let me know if you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer.  Everything will be okay. And congratulations! I wish you an uneventful pregnancy. :)"
"Well I wouldn’t worry or stress yourself too much.  It’s a low chance and after 20 weeks I believe the risk drops even lower. Just enjoy your pregnancy and try to distract yourself with things for your baby! Also, congratulations!"
"I'm not sure if it's my Sjögren's or one of my other conditions, but I definitely experience this, sometimes to the point where it's difficult to get up in the morning because I'm so stiff. I also sometimes get very weak so getting up is actually difficult because I don't have the strength to."

Here are some things that I've found that seem to help:

"Go to: Set two alarms. One for about an hour before your regular one. When the first one goes off, I wake up but I'm still stiff, weak, and tired. I find that for some reason, after about an hour of just laying in bed, I feel better. I use this time to drink water (I leave an insulated bottle on my nightstand), take morning meds, gently stretch, plan my day out, etc. Sometimes I don't need as much time and will get up after about half an hour and start getting ready, but the extra time allows me to be slower and take time to stretch as I walk around."

Other tips:

"- Potassium. You can use ""lite salt"" which is in with the table salt at most stores and is half potassium and half regular salt. Or a banana with breakfast."
#NAME?
"- Gentle stretching or yoga at night. I don't do ""flows"" or anything complicated. I like the basic stretches where you hold poses. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube is really good, she has videos for lots of trouble areas."

"I also have fibromyalgia, so I’ve always assumed my morning stiffness was from that. I could be wrong. The only thing that helps me is moving."
I'm too lazy to write it so here's a link to something I wrote a while ago that might help :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/cjsc1x/surfing_to_just_escape_reality_and_feelings_of/evfqvzf/

"In addition to magnesium, just 5 mins of basic yoga/stretching daily works wonders."

"You might also take omega 3 (anti-inflammatory) and ease up on omega 6 (pro-inflammatory) in case this is from inflammation, like in the case of sore muscles from exercise."
"It's pretty common among sjogrens patients. Haven't figured out how to fix it though. I find it's worse if I sweat during the night, so I turn the AC down at night."
I experience this often. I also have a fibro diagnosis.   Some days moving more helps. Other days it exhausts me but makes no difference in the stiffness.
"Yes, my calves are especially sore in the morning if I've had a long day the day before. I can tell right when I take my first steps out of bed. I take Advil and half a muscle relaxer, plus do some stretches. If I have the day off I'll take a hot bath. Also, magnesium may help with leg cramping. You could try a supplement and see if it helps."
I have lupus too so never sure what’s what but this happens to me too.  Often happens when I don’t get a lot of good sleep or if overdo stuff (not necessarily physical) the day before.

"I do find my diet plays a role in how my legs feel. They can get really bad if I eat a lot of bakery type foods. When I’m eating healthier, less processed foods, my legs tend to feel better."

My hands can get pretty bad too. Thankfully they both kind of ease up as the day progresses but then kind of resort back to weakness and giving out  again closer to the end of the day.
Wow thank you very much for your reply
That’s what I’ve noticed. It’s just mornings. Maybe I’ll try a good stretching routine when I wake up
"You just described the last 3 years of my life. The lip biopsy was my last hope and I was so nervous about the result. I had the same feelings, the exact same feelings you do. My husband was starting to get irritated by me, not believing me and it caused some serious fights. My family was getting fed up and not believing me. The 10 specialists I was seeing couldn’t figure out what was going on and didn’t seem to care. It was a dark time..."

"My biopsy came back positive even though I tested negative in all bloodwork. Finally the rhuematologist I was seeing took me seriously. I will be finding a new one though, since I am so fed up with him. I just needed him for the biopsy."

"My advice to you is to stick it out. It seems like a dark time, but you know there is something wrong. If the biopsy is negative, don’t be afraid to keep going. I vowed to myself that I wouldn’t give up if it was negative and I’d look into a differential diagnosis. I’d advise you to do the same!"

"If it’s positive, well you have an answer and you can tell everyone in your life to deal with it. It was very uplifting for me."

We understand you and are here for you!
[deleted]
"Good luck to you.  I understand how you feel as many others probably do too.  I just got my results back and they were positive.  I was so relieved to finally have an answer and a direction to go.  I turn 34 in two weeks and I've spent years going to doctors and specialists to be told nothing was wrong with me and to be treated like I was just trying to get pain pills.  People play off the symptoms but they don't realize how much it really affects us.  Luckily my wife saw the difference between my good days and bad days and encouraged me to see a doctor.  I luckily found a doctor who also wanted answers and she hooked me up with an awesome Rheumatologist who actually has Sjogren's herself.  She has been great.  It really sounds like you have Sjogren's but if not, DON'T GIVE UP.  Keep fighting and eventually, hopefully, you will have all the answers you need"
[deleted]
"Thank you so much! It does indeed seem like a dark time, I've been through a major depression and this is way different, it's not in my mind. I've been thinking whether those depressive episodes last year were cause or symptom somehow."
"I too have fights with my partner, it really sucks but it is such a constant strain on our relationship. It interferes with my daily activities, my eating and sleeping habits and so much else. I'm really hoping that what you say is true, that my doctor won't give me up even if the test comes back negative, and also I shouldn't let myself down but it seems like I can't deal with one more ""no results""."
"Thank you so much! That's exactly how it feels, me being hysterical."
"It's just that it gets at me when every doctor keeps saying that all my symptoms might well be psychosomatic. I know they might, but I feel they aren't. I know myself better than them, and I surely don't feel like my old self :("
"Thank you, that's really kind. I'll have the appointment to discuss the results on the 10th of June 🙏🏻"
"On the gum and skin discoloration, I honestly don't know."

"However, it is quite the struggle to work full time. The fevers, body aches and debilitating fatigue make it feel as if I'm swimming upstream or dog paddling in the rapids. The brain fog from my fibro doesn't help, either."

I don't know how much longer I can work full time for.
"Hopefully it's just a Sjogren's thing, but the only discoloration I've only ever had is reddened, bleeding gums when gingivitis acts up."

"I'd err on the side of being cautious, though, if your insurance allows it: Gum and lip discoloration (and severe fatigue) can be caused by Addison's disease. Can you get in to see your primary doc or send an email to your rheumatologist to let them know? Addison's disease is rare and easily treated but can be a pretty big deal if it's ignored (someone in my extended family has it)."

[https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/addisons-disease/](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/addisons-disease/)
I haven’t had any discoloration.
I had really red gums when I was deficient in B12; now

"they're pink as can be on supplements. I don't know about gray, though, that sounds like a vascular issue."
Not sure about the discoloration.

"For work, I live very close to my job. I work at a desk, on a computer. I can work from home or come in late if I need to. I'm super thankful to have this option."

"I try not to overexert myself. I'm not sure if it's the Sjogren's or another one of my conditions, but I definitely get something like post-exertional malaise (PEM), that comes on 1-2 days after really pushing myself. There are days when I wake up and I'm too weak to get out of bed. I also experience bad brain fog, to the level of confusion and not always making sense when I speak. My coworkers delight at how I type up extremely detailed notes on various tasks and processes and share them with everyone - but I rarely tell them the truth, that I need them to remember all the details of how to do my job."

"I tend to spend the whole weekend in bed or laying on the couch. Some weekends I will spend half the day out shopping where I'll walk quite a bit, but I usually don't tend to have the energy after a long work week to do much else."

"In the past, I used to work multiple jobs and go to university. I would be out and about every day from 6 am to midnight, working my butt off. When I first was diagnosed with my first autoimmune condition, I just had no energy anymore and was having the weirdest symptoms. Later I was diagnosed with other conditions and I had to start pruning down my schedule and finding more flexible options to finally graduate a few years ago. I'm lucky and grateful that I was able to work something out, but I'm sad that I couldn't do everything I wanted to at the level of excellence I aspire to."

"Anyway, anecdotally, eating low-carb, drinking a ton of water, taking my medicine, getting enough sleep, and avoiding over-exerting myself (especially in hot environments), - trying not to get to the point where I'm sweating heavily and breathing very hard -allows me to have a good level of energy, where I can get quite a bit done. On good weeks, I try to go for a 2-3 mile walk 4-5 times per week and go to yoga 2-3 times per week. On really good weeks, I go for walks every day and go to the gym (yoga and strength classes) every day. For me, true cardio (running, spin class, ellipticals, etc.) is out (it can literally take me days or weeks to recover from the PEM), but I have pretty good endurance for less exhausting exercise, and I find that the more I do it, the better I feel and the more I can handle."
"Sorry to hear you have been drafted to the wonderfully weird world of Sjogren’s. Welcome, nonetheless."

"While I don’t have the answer to your specific mouth rash, I would not be surprised to hear you have a fungal infection, which is not so uncommon with autoimmune issues. Sjogren’s seems to be associated with Thrush, which is the rash many patients seem to suffer when chronic mouth dryness is an issue."

The gray discoloring could be caused by medication or even food dyes that don’t easily clear away because saliva isn’t being produced.

"I’m not a doctor, so I’m just repeating the culprits that I’ve read about while researching my own symptoms."

"It’s great to ask your dentist about the issue, but you should have your doctor take a look at it and maybe culture it if they suspect fungal or bacterial infection. You can go to a walk-in clinic to get quicker answers to that problem. You don’t want to let infections get worse, because they will stick around for ages if you don’t nuke with the appropriate prescription. And they can get painful in time, so please get that checked as soon as possible."

"My best advice to you is to sip water all day. Tiny sips help make up for the lost saliva, which can help with digestion, too. That’s a big problem for me in the long run, and you really don’t want to deal with paralyzed stomach/motility issues. Ugh."

I will check back to answer some of your other questions soon. Just wanted to talk about the mouth rash first.

Good luck. Stay hydrated. Stop any infection as soon as possible.
Have you seen your rheumatologist yet?
[deleted]
No but my gums are a bit rough in texture on the sides of my inner upper jaw!
"I feel you, we share a lot of the same symptoms. Hang in there, hope you find a way to manage them somehow."
"Thank you so much for your reply! I'm actually supposed to see my rheumatologist for a check up in a week, so I'll definitely bring this up to her."
"Yeah, that's what got me worried. Thanks anyway. I'm glad you're feeling better!"
"Thank you so much! I'll try and get an appointment with my doc as soon as I can, it's really bothering me."

"Oh, I have water with me at all times, otherwise my mouth is horribly dry."

"How long have you had Sjogren's? I got diagnosed recently, but have had symptoms for years prior."
"Ugh, not yet. She's on vacation. Trying to find someone else to see me."
"Not yet, but will update when I find out anything"
Thank you.
"Thanks, and please let us know what you find out."
"For dry mouth, ask your doctor about saliva production medications Salagen and Evoxac. They can make a big difference for may. They both also have generics brands."
"Darn, I'm sorry."
"I get this a lot as well. ""Is your eye ok? It's red."""

"""I have an autoimmune disease."" followed by staring straight at them until they feel uncomfortable. I've never had anyone follow up about it, usually they just get awkward and leave it alone."
"They might assume that you're high on weed. Just say ""It's a Sjogren's thing, and I'm a bit self-conscious about it, really."" People will lay off it. They just don't realize all the many things we deal with."
"No one has ever commented on my red eyes & some days they are really red. Maybe it's a Scottish thing but we were brought up not to make personal remarks, ""unless you can say something nice, don't say anything at all"""
"Happens to me always. One time early in the morning I stopped to get gas. My friend and her baby were out in the car. I grabbed some snacks for the baby and a pastry for myself. This man looked at me and said ""munchies, huh?"" And I smiled and was like ""yeah?..."" And didn't realized until afterwards that he thought I was stoned! I carry Visine for redness, and lubricating drops for afterwards because I get embarrassed of my eyes. I see people looking at them especially in public under flourescent light they get BRIGHT RED! IT IS FRUSTRATING!"
"Obviously this would not be appropriate in a work setting (not that they are being appropriate for asking in the first place) but my knee-jerk response would be, ""I have an autoimmune disease that affects my eyes. What's your excuse for being a nosy asshole?"""

"I realize this is rather confrontational though and some people would rather not, but if I can make one person realize they are being rude and maybe alter how they interact with people in the future without just running their mouth I consider it a win."
"I am currently trying to find a job and I worry that my eyes make me look like I use drugs 24/7, none of the 'eye whitener' eyedrops I've tried has managed to do anything about it. x\_x"


Sometimes I photoshop my eyeballs in photos so they look white... : (


"Worst comment ever about them was from my 'JustNOMIL' (covert narcissist mother in law) who made a comment in lines of; 'Oh you look really nice today, shame about the eyes'. She is no longer part of my life I am glad to say, her son still is though. : P"
For a while I had a terrible flare up and my eyes were fully pink/red every day. One day a guy in my lab class actually asked me if I’d been punched in the face! I was like holy fuck no its because I have an autoimmune disease. I’m a very quiet person because I tend to be socially anxious and I was shocked! Definitely the worst remark I’ve gotten on it.
"I always say I have an autoimmune disorder that causes eye problems, usually people won’t ask anything more after that."

"And yeah, it’s annoying when people ask that but they have no idea you’re actually dealing with something more serious than a hay fever or being a bit tired. They don’t realize that question is sensitive to you because they most probably have never heard about sjögren’s syndrome."

"Maybe you can take that moment to spread some awareness on a weird autoimmune disorder we’re suffering from, that’s how I view the situation nowadays. :)"
I work in eyecare field and I get this all the time.  LOL.  I don’t take offense- I just think they are concerned and want to help and want to make sure I don’t have pink eye...LOL!  But after I tell them what’s up the OD/MD’s I meet with give me all types of advice; some that has really helped.

"I use Lumify.  It is newer and  over the counter.  It will have the whites of my eyes white again in 10 seconds.  Nothing else before has touched it.   I use it for important meetings or important events in general.  I don’t use it everyday.  Of course ask your eye doctor if it is ok if you are taking several different drops or if you have any other underlying conditions that may interact.  I think the last time I bought it, it was $11.  It is better than any other eye drop and I get instant relief.  The active ingredient in it,  brimonidine(treats glaucoma).  It is in really small doses and  the only OTC eye drop to have this active ingredient.   It has preservatives too, so if your doc is wanting you to use preservative free drops this isn’t the drop for you.  Just thought I would throw it out there in case it could help."

Here is an article from the AAO on the drops comparing it to other drops on the market.  It pretty much hits all the fear factors on what to watch out for.

"Again, clear it with your OD/MD to make sure it doesn’t interact with current care in place."

https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/new-over-counter-eye-whitening-drop-lumify
"I got this for years even before I was diagnosed! At school I was told all the time ""you look stoned"" because my eyes were red and often quite puffy. It really riled me up at the time as I was so offended that people might think I was using drugs (this changed lol) but if anyone has said something to me post-diagnosis I always tell them, yes its related to my autoimmune condition that I have no control over, thanks for pointing that out. I don't like going down the passive-aggressive route but sometimes people need to be made to feel bad for making such comments so they know not to do it again."
"I'm really sorry you had this experience though... in general, people suck and wouldn't consider the implications of what they're saying unless they're made to feel bad. As people with invisible illnesses we're much more sensitive to this."
I've gotten comments about looking stoned my entire life  and was just diagnosed today. Or that I look super tired. I definitely understand and I'm sorry.
I am glad I’m not the only one who gets this. It always seems to be acquaintances or strangers which is a bit odd.
"This is a great response. I'm going to try it. When I tell people I have two autoimmune disease most people look at me like I'm speaking Chinese. ""What the hell is that?"" I've gotten, from friends, family members. I respond by explaining to them that I have things that do not work right in my immune system that is weakened. My body gets confused and makes antibodies that attack ""itself"" and I follow that by explaining I believe it started with EBV, that mutilate your immunoglobins. That is my belief!"
I get that of course. Some people ask things and have no idea they could be pressing on a really sensitive issue..we’re all guilty of it I’m sure!

"However what I’m getting at is the harshness really. The “devils dick” comment may should comical, but it wasn’t said in that way. I don’t get why people think it’s ok to be mean. Im defiantly not the only one of us lot to encounter harsh comments like that. And often if I say it’s an auto immune disease there are more questions or more confusion! Plus they often end up feeling really guilty and awkward!"

"Thanks for your comment though, I know I should just say what it is. But I’m just finding it really hard as everyone’s reactions are different, along with the battering of my self esteem 😅"
"Everybody thinks all our brains work the same. Maybe something like that wouldn't have hurt that guy or woman like it hurt you, so they are using a gauge they think should apply to everyone. But of course it doesn't."
"Yes, every evening after dinner I get the flu-like shivers. I feel cold and shaky with a tiny elevated fever. I explained it to the rheumatologist and now in addition to lupus, fibro and sjogrens, he is testing my damn thyroid!!"
I definitely do the same but I have fibromyalgia and blood circulation problems as well. So it could be related to either of those.
Yes! It’s like a hot flash on top of a cold sweat shiver with goosebumps and everything! Everyone keeps checking my thyroid. Levels are all normal but I have an enlarged thyroid with a nodule. I’ve only been diagnosed with Sjögrens and fibromyalgia. I do have Endometriosis as well so I never know what is causing it either.
I'm seeing a neurologist tomorrow to see if the shivers might be more brain-related than temperature-related. I'll let you all know if it is!
"YES!! I noticed this about 2 years ago and I started actually trying to be mindfully monitoring it about a year ago. I noticed it was almost ALWAYS after eating and in the evenings or nighttime. I was diagnosed as “Immunologically A-Typical” as a young child, but no doctor could figure it out until being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 8 months ago and Sjögren’s about 2 months ago (thanks to the Mayo Clinic). I have also struggled with thyroid issues and am currently taking Synthroid and have normal thyroid levels; as well as Hyperadrenergic POTS (which is also under good control) and still suffer from this uncontrollable shivering almost every night after eating. So I feel as though it is more likely related to either Sjögren’s or Fibro- my bet would be on Sjögren’s given some info I’ve read on the effects Sjögren’s can have on your metabolic system. SO satisfying to know that I’m not the only one who has this strange symptom (although I’m not happy any of us have to deal with it, it’s just NOT comfortable)!! Anyone with a better understanding as to WHY this occurs, please elaborate!!?"
"In later afternoon, early evening it feels as if someone has filled my insides with I've cubes."

"At bed time, the wife is practically sweating and I'm wearing pajamas, a thermal top, thick socks, AND WINTER GLOVES...snuggled up next to her trying to leech away her body heat and life force."
"I have this as well, waiting for referral to my rheumatologist to get an appointment. They tested for thyroid values but said there was nothing wrong in my bloodworks that would indicate it so the hope with the Rheumatologist is to get to try medications for improved blood circulation since my body is like a heat sink all the time, except of course if it is really hot in summer at which point I can't cool down instead. Have spent past summers jumping in and out of ice cold showers and wearing wet t-shirts to cope and spend winter half in fleece outfits, knitted socks and gloves. Not sure how I will be able to do that when I hopefully find a job. x\_x"

thanks for posting. I believe there are quite a few more studies on other autoimmune diseases like RA if you are inclined that also measured fatigue and it was also very successful in lessening symptoms.

I took my first dose with food and was fine. I think it causes diarrhea in some people but after all I have been through that would be highly insignificant if  overall im feeling better! LOL
This is the one Im taking but there are 1 or 2 other options.

"""Life Extension Peony Immune"""

I don't think im allowed to post the amazon link. There are a few people with AI that seem to really get some help.

It is used in Chinese medicine mixed with other herbs for immune and pain and I think it originally studies were done on AI patients in China. Hopefully more people will try and we can get a better sense of how well it works. I will definitely keep all posted.
"you're welcome! I hope its the Sjogrens elixir we have all been waiting for! Cheap, on Amazon Prime and more Effective than the drugs! haha"
"Thanks. I’m interested in trying it, but I do have wicked environmental allergies and a leaky gut that’s an ongoing struggle to heal. How long have you been taking it and has it caused any gastro distress?"
I just started yesterday so too soon to tell anything.I am slowly ramping up. After dose 1 yesterday Id say I have looser stool but not diareah. No nausea or cramping.
"Good to hear.  I went on Xiidra drops and stopped getting the plugs since I didn’t feel like I needed them anymore and you need to get new ones every 3 months.  Still have tough days, but it’s better."
"I had never heard of tear duct plugs, so you've given me some new information to ask my doctor about! Drops don't seem to last hardly any time at all for me anymore."
So glad to hear this. How did the plugs help your nose? Or was it the medication?
Did your insurance cover it? What was the out of pocket cost?
My ophthalmologist told me that I only need to replace them annually... maybe they’ve been updated since you had them last?

I’m with you. Most days suck. But the good ones are great!
"Do you know how the Xiidra drops are different than normal drops? My gel (I forget the brand, they're off the shelf) drops don't seem to work at all anymore."
If you decide to get them hopefully they work as well for you as they do for me! The first night is super weird though because it feels different but then you get used to them pretty quickly.
Apparently any liquid I was producing was leaking through the ducts into my nose. 🤷‍♀️
They did. The eye drops are $20 a month and the eye plugs shouldn’t be too bad though I haven’t gotten the bill yet.
"There are different kinds. Some last until the ophthalmologist remove them, others get gradually absorbed. How long they last before being absorbed depends on your body. According to my ophthalmologist, the ones I have last 6 months in average, never the less I need new ones every second month."

"Years before I got my first plugs I made a Sjögren diary to see if I could find a pattern in my eye problems. I continued after I got the plugs, so it was easy for me to see when the effect of the plugs were gone."
"What normal drops?  Xiidra is a prescription drop that is an alternative to Restasis.  Ophthalmologist told me they know they work, but it is less clear WHY they work.  Restasis works as an immune suppressant, but it can take some time (a year possibly) to work where as Xiidra has immediate effect."
Just standard over the counter drops like sustane.
"Those are for temporary relief.  Those are like lube for your eyes.  Prescription drops are different and try to correct what’s preventing your eyes from producing their own tears and oils.  You still might need the OTC from time to time, even with Xiidra or Restasis."

"Both of my ex boyfriends left me partly because of my autoimmune disorders, it’s very rough for us sick people :("
"Sjogren's is a piece of the puzzle. But your attitude towards it is a major aspect. Are you in therapy yourself? It's not easy to deal with this without support. And support isn't just talking about how hard it is. Supports finding ways to continue living a good life. I doubt it's all sjogrens, since you mentioned heavy drinking and resentment. Maybe it's that giving up feeling that comes with drinking heavily, idk, but I highly doubt it's all about the sjogren's and I would recommend that you not make it all about the sjogren's or focus on that. It will be hard to come back from that but therapy will help, and you need to validate and to see things from his point of view. It may be really difficult for you but it's also really difficult for him too"
"I would suggest marriage counseling ASAP. If money is tight, look for other community resources, we were able to use the VA because my partner is a veteran."

"Chronic illness takes a huge toll, and counseling gives you tools to communicate more effectively. We were not quite as far as you, but we found enormous benefits from counseling, we are now closer than ever."

"Best of luck, I’m so sorry!"
I am so sorry you are facing these difficulties. I recently got married and I’ve been open and upfront about how Sjogrens affects me but I am scared. Right now it’s mild but I told him I can promise it’ll be that way forever.
You’re right it doesn’t seem to just be the Sjögren’s and I know this isn’t what you mean but they also think I have two other autoimmune diseases as well as depression and anxiety. The mental health issues are probably just as much or more of a barrier as my physical illness. A lot of that depression is definitely situational though. I’ve been trying to understand how he feels for at least 5 years but he also makes that really hard. I’ve ask for him to seek out counseling but he hasn’t followed through. I see a psychiatrist but don’t have a good counselor. I did have someone but recently stopped their services once she started blowing me off for appts and then the last time we talked she said something like “well you’ll be in my thoughts and I hope things improve between the 2 of you” and then didn’t offer to make another appt so I took that as she was done. It was a phone counseling and was paid for by our insurance so idk what the issue was and my anxiety was too high to even ask. I know I need to find another but damn  I don’t want to rehash all that. I know it’s not a valid excuse but for now it’s what I must do. If I seen him making any kind of effort it would go so far with me but sadly this not how it’s going.
"Yes, but at least you are not the only one to go through this"
If given the chance to go back in time and  attempt to save your marriage what is something you wish you’d of done differently? Im not sure this can be saved but I want to try :(
We can get counseling through the military one source as he’s active duty army but without him making an honest effort it won’t work. I just don’t know how to make him even want to do that effort
Mine used to be and now it’s life consuming. I encourage you to keep a healthy dialogue and make sure he has support. My husband and I don’t from family or friends and it’s hard
"My autoimmunes knocked me out of the workplace shortly after I married my ex-husband.  My journey to understanding how to deal with my new horrible normal always included having to manage my husband through it all first.  He completely unraveled and began several years of cycling with psych meds to deal with his depression and anxiety.  We both came from dysfunctional backgrounds and neither of us had good skills to make a marriage work.  We fell into some very traditional and very f-d up gender roles for a few years until I decided I couldn't live the way I was.  Everything became very clear to me when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  He was able to help me and care for me for exactly 3 weeks after I had the tumor removed.  This was before I had even begun the treatment phase.  So I went through my radiation treatments while living with someone who resented me and felt sorry for himself because I was sick.  We are divorced now.  I still love the man and sometimes I miss the marriage.  But I am so much better off without the constant influence of someone who truly believed I was deliberately making his life miserable after many years of watching me suffer.  He simply had zero capacity to care for me and also had zero capacity to understand how much energy and caretaking he required to keep him functioning since he was our sole breadwinner.  Since the divorce I can see how much the marriage was preventing me from focusing on taking care of myself.  If you've been trying to see things from his point of view for 5 years and he is blocking your efforts it doesn't seem like he is as interested in being a helpful partner as he is in using your illness as an excuse for his own issues.  It is possible you are focused on him becoming the kind of partner to you that he is demonstrating he can't be.  If you do go back into counseling perhaps the focus should be on you, your health and what the best path forward is to improvement.  The answer you might come up with could be that you are better off without someone who isn't capable of being the partner you need."

"I was married prior to meeting my partner. At the time we were together (with my ex) I did not want to get divorced even though we were having huge problems and tried everything I could think of to make it work. When it came down to marriage counseling, he refused. I couldn’t make him go or be invested in the process. That is what told me I had to let him go, since he was not willing to put in the effort to make it work."

"I hope it doesn’t come to that for you, but don’t push yourself too hard for something if he won’t meet you halfway."

"p.s.-our marriage also failed when I got extremely sick. I guess some people cannot handle being with someone that’s chronically ill. Fortunately, there are other fish in the sea and later I found a great guy that is super supportive of me and my needs. Best of luck! *hugs*"
Thank you as I believe I’m going to need it
"What helped for me was figuring out my inflammatory food triggers, exercise and meditation. Took awhile to find the right mix, but it was worth it. I would be skeptical of just one thing. She could try it but I would try to take a broader view. I also found good fats, increasing fruits and veggies and spices like turmeric and cinnamon to help too."
According to the article it helps prevent an autoimmune response when we eat. It’s interesting. My teeth stain horribly so I sometimes brush with it. I wish they had stated how much to use. I’ll be looking into this more. Thanks for sharing.
Thanks for sharing article. I haven’t heard of this but will consider trying to reduce inflammation
Thank u for sharing this! I used to take it daily for about a week can’t remember why. I’m gonna try to give it ago in bt all the other crap i take 😂 u know some feel it has killed their cancers. I have stage 2 kidney failure now and looking to halt that so this looks interesting
What medications?  I am not subscribed anything that helps.
It promotes more acid production in the stomach?  Don’t a lot of people deal with acid reflux and want to do just the opposite?
"Hi guys, brands like Essentia have sodium bicarbonate in them already :)"
"Yes not thinking just one thing, but I am curious if anyone had any experience and if worth recommending"
"I hope we can find some more info. From what I’ve read around the web it’s something like 1/4 teaspoon with cup of water, some say start with 1/8."

"Edit: [link](https://blog.daveasprey.com/baking-soda-combats-autoimmune-disease-study/)  is where I got some of that info, dunno if it’s reliable"

Edit2: [this article](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/less-than-a-teaspoon-of-baking-soda-every-day-can-help-prevent-autoimmune-diseases-60342) using 2g in 600ml bottled water drank throughout the day
Speak to your doctor... something like this is done for people with renal failure
"I think steroids, muscle relaxers and pain killers. I have to look later, kind of forgot.  They help somewhat but she is still rather in pain"
My doc put me on plaquenil and it appears to help my flare ups
I am not sure. There isn’t any solid studies with this disease
Yeah in thinking about it that is why I took it but got distracted and stopped
My doctor and rheumatologist refuse to put me on it.
"You can ask, tbh there's not really a downside to it or side effects, it's a malaria medication. But I have had better results with diet and lifestyle changes too"
They outright refuse to prescribe it to me so I cannot try it.
Well if you want to go on it find a new doc
I have.  Same answer.
So then I'd trust your docs there must be a reason for it
No I won't trust them.  They have no idea and have absolutely got everything wrong so far.  This isn't aimed at you at all however so sorry if my tone is off.
"Plaquenil changed my life honestly, the fatigue improved so much."
Plaquenil made a HUGE difference in my quality of life. Night and day.

I agree with everyone saying to find a new dr
"While plaquenil is mostly for arthritis, my doctor immediately put me on low dose plaquenil when I was diagnosed."

"I'm wondering if it's for those whose chief complaint is joint stiffness and pain (my complaints), but ultimately (from my understanding) it suppress the over active immune response. I have seen my blood tests results decrease over time, and the severity of my flares has decreased."

"Definitely find another rheumatologist, you should have a doctor fighting for you not against you. Listening and understanding your concerns and all your symptoms. Discussion of short term and long term treatment plans."
"Talk to a rheumatologist, the plaquenil is really more for the Arhtiritis that accompanies all this. Pilocarpine is helpful for your body to produce moisture also. I was put on those 2 from the first day of diagnosis. Good luck to you, and do NOT be afraid to get another opinion"
Gabapentin is for bad nerve pain. I think you need a new doctor that will discuss your symptoms & treatment with you.
"I was diagnosed in June after six weeks of extreme fatigue. I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to reset my system, and have been on hydroxychloroquine ever since. As far as I'm concerned, that's what's keeping me sane. No side effects."
"I agree, new doctor time. A neurologist might be a good idea."

"I have small fiber neuropathy that is probably due to my sjorgren's. My rheumatologist was hesitant to draw a connection. Both have been diagnosed via biopsy, because every single test and all the bloodwork is normal."

"You need a team approach since its covering multiple disciplines. Start with a GP that doesn't suck and is willing to handle whatever they can, and coordinate with specialists. Make it a point to talk to them about that when you first visit. If they give you trouble, try another GP, and keep going until you feel like you are being heard and understood."

"Its helpful to write everything down - your history, your current concerns and issues, what you tried, what worked, what didn't. Bring a copy of it with you to every visit and keep it updated."

Don't rely on doctors to have their shit together. Your problem is twilight zone stuff for 99% of them and you have to take an active role.
"Plaquenil definitely helps with fatigue, brain fog and achy joints for me. I didn’t think it was helping until I went off it for a while. I lost a little weight so my dosage was dropped not long ago and my symptoms aren’t as in check anymore."

"I took Gabapentin for trigeminal neuralgia and it really helped all my neurological issues but it made my brain spin. I was walking into walls, couldn’t walk in a straight line, couldn’t drive, etc. had to go off of it."
get a different doctor.

Gabapetin gave me Parkinson’s.   It did fade when I discontinued.
Do you have paraesthesia in your hands and feet? I had it my whole life and didn't know it was an actual problem until I was diagnosed with Sjogrens. Raynaud's Syndrome is a common diagnosis with Sjogren's patients. My rheumatologist recommended amlodipine. I hadn't consistently taken it but I'm definitely going to try it out. Winter is coming..
God.  I can't believe I've been so badly served.
Same. I was finally able to deal with other aspects of my life and the disease because my fatigue was so much better.
Lots of people have good results with plaquenil. Unfortunately I broke out in the most horrendous rash and had to stop taking it. So my advice would be to start on a low dose and see how you go
What did it do for you though?  I am really in a bad way and if I find out it would have held this off I'll be fuming.  I will change my GP.
Lol no doctor has ever done that for me and the Rheumatologist wouldn't see me when the doctor spoke to them.  I'm disgusted I didnt get what you did.  Are you in the US?
My GP told mr pilocarpine only produces for eyes and mouth.  Is this also nonsense?
Steroid shot?  Nobody has ever mentioned this.
The neurologist refuses to see me.
You think I have small fibre?
Thank you.  Not really no.  I've given up really as no body will ascribe me a rheumatologist.  I saw one privately but then they discharge you after one session.     It's hard enough being seen in only 10 minutes by a doctor and they just shrug.
You think I might have Raynauds?
"For me if helped my joint pain and it gave me way more energy. I already had my other symptoms (rashes, dry eye, swollen glands) under control from other things but honestly the decrease in fatigue was life changing. Not being hyperbolic."
"Yes I'm in Phoenix, Az from reading other people's experiences I definitely got extremely lucky. I met my regular doctor, who did some general testing, after a follow up two weeks later I got a referral to a rheumatologist he knew. I was able to get in a week later, due to a cancellation."

"What might be in my favor was both my doctor's, general and specialist, are older doctors. My rheumatologist is probably in his 70s? He's very old school, yes you are due for a decent wait time to be seen but he definitely sits listens and won't stop until he figures out what the diagnosis is."

Your general won't give you a referral? Were your tests deemed abnormal? Mine were abnormal showing either rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.

"Sadly, I know that first rheumatologist appointment can be months away, which is very disheartening."
"Honestly, even THAT is helpful. Without saliva, how does your system digest?  I dont know if it is only for eyes and mouth, but it sure does make me feel better when it is active."
Not necessarily. You may want to inquire about it if you feel those symptoms. Might explain why you have them and might give you a treatment plan if it is.
I want the prickling pain and skin sensitivity gone.  I want the pain gone.  All of it.
I have saliva.  It is a dryer and sometimes sticky lips but nowhere near as bad as it used to be.
Thank you.  Honestly they're not interested in any treatment plans.  They only shake their heads and ask why I'm there and what I want.
"Obviously I have no idea, but from my experience last year....I had eye pain, it turned into iritis, which turned into my pupil doing this crazy thing where it constricted way too much and wouldn’t widen and I almost lost my eyesight. It was very scary. That was ultimately how I wound up in a rheumatologist office. Not trying to scare you, because that was my own issue and we are all different, but I would check in with an optometrist just to rule anything out."
"There's a few different kinds of eye pain, so is it:"

#VALUE!
#VALUE!
#VALUE!
#VALUE!
#VALUE!
#VALUE!
#VALUE!
"My first symptom was eye pain, this awful headache around my eyes, and a few days of my eyes profusely watering. Turns out my lacrimal glands (tear glands that sit behind your top eyelid, tucked behind your brow bone) were swelling. They swelled so badly it filled all the space behind my eyes and caused my eyes to swell shut. I’ll need surgery to fix the damage to my stretched out eyelids because they now droop in my field of vision."

"Could be dry eye, could be something else. I would say eye pain, especially persistent eye pain, and definitely if it comes with visual disturbances, warrants a doctors visit. It’s just not something you want to play around with."
"Eye drops, stop looking at screens and lights, don't rub them. Some erithromyacin if you feel it's irritated."
Yes!!! Feel free to PM me.

"My small fiber neuropathy includes/lead to/is related to autonomic neuropathy, also known as dysautonomia. This was actually my first diagnosis, years before Sjogrens. Basically includes POTS (increase in heart rate with standing), or IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia), and orthostatic hypotension (drop in BP with standing). I follow cardiology and neurology and am treated with corlanor. Other treatments include metoprolol, propanolol, fludrocortisone, and midodrine."

"Lung wise, things took forever to diagnose. My pulmonologist suggested mild asthma. My 6 minute walk tests and PFTs (pulmonary function tests) were almost always normal even though I felt so short of breath. Eventually a HRCT (high res CT) showed bronchiectasis, a structural change in the bronchioles (airways) due to Sjogrens. This causes mucus trapping and can lead to difficulty breathing. I got a nebulizer and chest vest, and take mucinex, to help relieve these secretions. Also have to actively pay attention to infections etc and treat immediately. I wasn’t fully relieved though so I did a methylcholine challenge, turns out I have severe asthma but it is cough variant - I cough instead of really wheezing, but my lung volumes do drop significantly with minimal irritation. I am not sure if this is Sjogrens related but it has definitely complicated the bronchiectasis."
"I don't have any answers, but I'm dealing with the same thing and boy howdy does it suck."
Same issues here!! How weird. 😳
[deleted]
"i have sjorgrens and small fiber neuropathy. Like someone else mentioned, the dysautonomic symptoms can feel like lung/heart issues, and that feeling like you can't breathe can make you super anxious. It took me some time to realize I was actually getting *too much* oxygen. I had a pulmonologist basically laugh at me. 🤦‍♀️"

"I get light headed (even when I'm not hyper-oxygenated), my bp will just randomly drop sometimes, especially when I push myself too hard or am in a really hot or cold environment. Salt and putting my feet up helps. I was also on florinef until I moved away from my doctors. It seemed to help (this is called ""orthostatic intolerance"", brw). There's also other dysautonomic issues with your heart and blood, like POTS."

"I get a lot of aches, particularly in my rib cage. It makes it harder to breathe (on top of the dryness and inflammation in my nose and mouth). I'm not sure if its exactly the same phenomena, but it sounds a lot like ""the MS hug"" which is common in a lot of autoimmune disorders, and in particular fibromyalgia, which is also super common in sjorgrens patients. Some things to look into anyway."
Thank you sooo much for your reply. I so appreciate all the great info you mentioned and will look into your suggestions. Your experience sounds very familiar to what my niece goes through with Cystic Fibrosis.

It sounds like you have been dealing with this a long time. Sorry you had to acquire all this “wisdom” the hard way. Thanks again for your help and I wish you all the best!
It sure does. So sorry to hear you are dealing with this stuff too. Big hugs 💕
"If and when I get any new answers I’ll give an update. For the time being I’ll continue to read obsessively, cry and feel overwhelmed and keep at it!"
"I’m new to all of this, but I have read a lot that reveals a disease that can effect so much, yet is hard to reveal the reason. We all have to keep pushing so hard it seems and that is maddening and terrifying - but as I am learning you cannot give up! Hope you get some answers!"
"Thanks for your reply. I’m adding “heart issues” to my growing list and def need to read up on POTs, tho I’m thinking back to my 20s and all the weird symptoms I used to have that I’ve forgotten about and make me think I’ve had it all along!"
"Bronchiectasis is very similar to cystic fibrosis. Not as bad unless it is advanced, and not genetic, but theoretically the same as far as the structural changes to the lungs goes."

No problem. Let me know if you need any help.
"Something I learned: write everything down and make the doctors read it and scan it all into your chart if they can. Keep it up to date. And bring it with you every visit, every doctor, and go over it every time, especially as new stuff comes up or you remember stuff from the past you might have forgotten."
Good idea. I’ve been keeping records on my own for my reference and also to send on to others outside of my medical network. My neurologist has been good about charting all the things I mention to her. My husband often is on the call or visit because I just can’t retain everything anymore. Thx for the great tips!
"Have you considered any dietary changes to see if that may help? I say this with full understanding of how hard it can be, I have been cutting things out/experimenting with what works best for my various autoimmune conditions for the last 5 years."

I have been on an elimination diet called [the Autoimmune Protocol ](https://www.thepaleomom.com/start-here/the-autoimmune-protocol) for over a year now. I think cutting out all grains and soy is the best thing I’ve ever done for my health.

"I also take a medication called cevemeline to increase tear and saliva production and it helps tremendously! I added a sea buckthorn oil supplement and it does seem to help, along with lots of [preservative-free eye drops.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZHK96H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_m.ToDbWRX77B6) My doctor recommends those because they have the added flax seed oil to help lubricate the eyes naturally."

"I hope you find something that works for you, this disease is the worst! Sending big hugs <3"
"Do you use the heavier eye ointment at night? It will blur your vision, so use it right before sleep. I have found it makes the next day slightly less dry when I remember to use them."
I found 76 tonsil stones the other day. Lol. Be careful.
"I literally just made this complaint to my rheumatologist yesterday and she prescribed me something called pilocarpine.  I haven't taken it yet so I can't vouch for it, but she said that it should cause my salivary glands to produce more saliva and mucus, which should keep them from getting so irritated and swollen (the lump you can't swallow).  Otherwise I use lots of Biotene and xylitol sweetened hard candies."
Neti pot to moisturize and clear sinuses. Xylimelts for throat.
"I use cevelmine too but gives me a slight headache, i have been doing green smoothies and trying plant based diet.  My eye dr has me put organic coconut oil on my eyes am and pm and use nite time gel.  May try humidifier to get more moisture in the air as well as saline nasal spray it will drain down your throat.  A lot of people don't like but i swear by it and steroid nasal spray when sinuses and allergies are flaring up.  I also use local honey for allergies and in hot tea to coat the throat.  Plus just comforting.  Good luck!🙂"
I've been dealing with sinus issues every week. I'm really into natural herbal remedies and started using [Fenugreek and Thyme for sinus](https://www.healthyhuemans.com/healthy-body/5-incredible-benefits-of-fenugreek-and-thyme-for-sinus). It's definitely decreased my symptoms and also has helped boost my mood overall. It's been a few weeks but I think it's a keeper. 
Dietary changes have been the greatest positive influence on my body. Look for anti-inflammatory diets.

"I have started a gluten-free diet combined with certain vegetables (Broccoli, brussel sprouts)."

I have also read that cutting out your tonsils help. But I personally don't have any troubles with my tonsils.
I’ll have to look into the supplement- thank you! I’ve tried changing diets as well as everything else I can think of and nothing has helped the dry throat/sinus issues.
"I’ll try that, thanks!"
Are tonsil stones those weird white lumps I keep spitting out? About the size of a piece of gravel?
I’ve been having those for years. They are so gross.
"Dude. I had NEVER in my life had tonsil stones before, then like three years ago all of a sudden....bam! And my tonsils haven’t gone down since. In fact, it’s slowly getting worse/tonsils and crypts getting bigger (although-since about six months ago-I don’t see any tonsil stones anymore? Idk. It’s weird.). So annoying."

"Between that and the sinuses, I’m about to throw myself off a damn wall."
"Biotene helps me some, too."
"Hmm. My rheumatologist didn’t say anything about swollen salivary glands...(granted, he didn’t say much of anything...diagnosis, no meds, come see me every six months to have your liver and kidneys checked..why are you so tired? Idk. People be tired sometimes.🙄) Does the biotene help your throat at all? I have the mouthwash but it’s not really helping. I mean, it’s for your mouth so I assumed it wouldn’t help the throat but I thought gargling would at least help the tonsils a bit."
Oh i forgot Rephresh mega 3 eye drops with flaxseed oil are wonderful also!
Hmmm I’ll have to try the saline nasal spray. Steroid sprays help my sinuses but they’re so constant and I don’t want to continuously use steroid spray! What is the coconut oil supposed to help?
"Great, thanks for this! I’ll definitely look into it!"
Any time! I hope you find something that gives you relief. Sending love ❤️
"You are correct, sir. (Madame?)"
Tilt your head back when you gargle. Don't be afraid to swallow a tiny bit.

I'd be getting a new rheumatologist. It doesn't sound like this guy knows anything about sjogrens.
Yes i dont usually do the steroid unless desperate.   The coconut oil helps lubricate and keep eyes moist.  He said with sjogrens the oil glands in our eyes can dry up and he said it would  help.  It doesnt matter if u get in your eye either.  I usually  rub it on the put in pm eye gel the put on my eye mask with a kleenex between so my mask doesn't get all oily plus it keeps moisture in as my husband sleeps with a fan.
"Sir works for me stranger. God I've been wondering what on earth they are and why I kept spitting them out,gross little things. Almost every new health problem I have seemingly ends up being just another facet of Sjogren's."
"Yeah, he was kind of dismissive of the symptoms even as he provided a diagnosis within the same breath. I was more than a little pissed."
Interesting! Have you noticed if it helps with itchiness at all? My eyes are always so itchy throughout the day I end up running almost all my makeup off! 🙄
"You’re telling me. Literally my tooth cracked when I was drinking water yesterday. WATER. And of course it would happen on a Friday so now I get to go all weekend before I get a damn root canal. It’s not even like I don’t have good dental hygiene, either! I’m so done."
I cant wear any eye makeup it irritates my eyes.  My eyes don't usually itch so not sure about that but its  worth a try.
"Mate, every single day when I'm brushing my teeth, I'm waiting for a bit to just shear off. That's a bugger cause of the irony, but I can't imagine risking it with a glass of water, Jesus!"
Wearing a sleep mask at night helps my eyes not dry out so much.  I use one that doesn’t touch my eyes at all.  Also try warm compresses to express the oil glands on your eyelids.
"If it's the same as I get, it's because the outer layer of your eyes (epithelium) is so dry that it starts to crack or get stuck on your eye lids. Mine was very bad a few years ago but I've learned a few things that makes it somewhat manageable:"

* Don't get dehydrated ever (be extra aware if you have a cold)
* Use plenty of eye drops also during the day. They eye must never be completely dry.
* Use drops without salt or preservatives- both can make your eyes more dry if you apply the drops more than 4 times a day
"* Use a thicker gel version at night, also without salt or preservatives"
* Use contacts or (sun)glasses if it's windy
"* If it's bad, ask your doctors for tear duct plugs. These will help the moisture you apply to stay in the eyes."
"* If possible, avoid rubbing your eyes. Any friction can damage a dry epithelium and cause a breakage. Be especially careful if you use eye make up"
Sleeping with a cool mist humidifier pointed at me helps with this on really bad nights
"This is dry eye for me. I have to put drops in several times in the morning to get to a comfortable level.  I also started using Genteal gel at bedtime, which seems to help.  What drops are you using?"
Along with taking breaks and using eye drops at work (I also have to stare at a screen all day) I have found that during the breaks I need to focus my eyes on something very far away. I walk over to the windows and look in the distance after putting in some drops and it really helps give my eyes a rest. Feel better soon!
"Massive issue for me and it leads to recurrent corneal erosion, if severe enough I assume any one of us could develop that without proper care, highly important to start lubricating more or with stronger product before bed, when I do this religiously I suffer FAR less.  Happy healing!"
You can try using an organic cold pressed castor oil drop in your eyes before bedtime. Plenty of YouTube videos on it and I asked my eye doc and he said it's safe. Be sure to buy the right product though.
I don't remember the name right now. But i use drops( but not while at work) and use the gel at night. I thought the gel at night time will get rid of this feeling on waking up. But it has not.
"Maybe time for prescription drops?  I tried to get Restasis, but my insurance won't cover it and I really can't afford the $550 price tag.  My eye doc told me about how compounding pharmacies are now making custom eye drops using your own blood serum and plasma (!!!) so I'm going that route soon."
"It's making it hard to work, eye discomfort. It feels like deep seated pain in both eyes. Is this certainly due to dry eye? Or I misinterpreting something else like lack of sleep?"
"Xiidra is similar and usually covered.  Both companies also have a secondary card you can sign up for. Restasis it won't help much with since you aren't getting insurance to cover it, but it should help and run with your insurance for xiidra. It will reduce it to 5-10 bucks. Helps immensely. You just sign up on their website."

Just fyi- my optometrist suggested that the reason I have so many issues with my eyes burning from the drops is inflammation. She says a short round of steroids can help this and make it far more tolerable. I don't know how true or not that is. I was already 3 months in. They do help me but if I have a flare or start getting lax with my drops I have issues all over again.
It could be a number of things...
Do you work in front of a computer screen all day? Or are you around chemicals or outdoor allergens?  All of those will make dry eyes worse. And lack of sleep doesn't help.
"Also, how is your water intake?  I can tell a positive difference when I'm well hydrated."
Yes I sit infront of computer all day and then watch laptop after getting home. I have this sensation even if I sleep for more than 8 hrs. So I am finding it hard to differentiate if it is dry eye or bad quality of sleep despite sleeping longer.
"Okay, you HAVE to use eye drops at work, and make yourself take a screen break every hour. Set an alarm if you need to!  This is classic dry eye, and you need to be proactive about it to avoid (further) damage."
Fish oil can also help a little bit. It's not a game changer for me but its helpful for enough things so why not
That is scary. Thanks. I find it hard to do the drops myself. That's why I don't do it at work.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be scary!  I just want you to know how important it is to nourish your eyes ❤️"
"Here is the technique I use [Dr Eye Health video: how to put eye drops in your eye easily](https://youtu.be/e9q94usfZjk). I have one more tip that I find super helpful. Before I tip my head back, I hold the dropper directly in front of my eye with the technique from the video and look at the tip. Then I tip my head back with my eye looking at the tip of the dropper so I’m sure it’s still properly aligned. Finally, I squeeze the bottle and administer the drop. I almost never miss!"
Look into LDN (low dose naltrexone).  Was life changing for me in regard to brain fog and fatigue.

Lots of good Facebook groups for LDN and Autoimmune.

"Best of luck, glad you can rest easy at least knowing what it is now."

I’d say finding ways to comfort your dry mouth and dry eyes is something you can do in the meantime.

EYES
I love Refresh or Systane brand eye drops (the ones that come in individual vials are ideal). I also found a thing at the pharmacy that’s like an eye cover but you can warm it up in the microwave and put it on your eyes. Also using a lid scrub helps remove debris.

MOUTH
Check out all the Biotene products like toothpaste and mouthwash that can help with dry mouth. Gum with xylitol is the best. Brush your teeth multiple times a day to help with cavities. I also really like the Therabreath mints.
"So, there is a Lupus Discord support group [here](https://discord.gg/3vBFjv) that is open to all autoimmune diseases.  I'm only diagnosed as Sjogrens, but I've found it helpful to discuss medication side effects (many of the meds are the same), symptoms, as well as to vent about things there.  The reality with Sjogrens (and many autoimmunities) is that while there is medication much of the care is to treat symptoms (special mouth wash, eye drops, lotions, etc.) and its great sometimes to get feedback from a group of people who might have already figured parts of this out."
"I have a little of everything. (Dry eyes, dry mouth, lung stuff, neurological)."

Okay I will check put the website!!

No dentist coverage and eye doctors thought eyes were from the psoriasis (nope!).

"I'm allergic to plaquenil (will make me go blind, tried it years ago)."

Right now I dont have one...mainly because it's been a struggle to get my psoraic arthritis  under control (just bad medications and my body become too tolerant too fast).

My rhuem said once that's under control we will start addressing the sjogrens issue.

Thanks again!!
"I dunno if you have the interest or spoons, but there are some actual jobs that aren't scams and have a lot of work from home options - they'll just take some training."

"One is medical coding  - my mom does that and works from home. You have to go back to school and get a certification, but my mom did it in her 50s, with just a high school diploma."

"The other is programming/tech[1]. Remote jobs are not as common as people make them out to be, especially for people with very little experience, but its really common for office tech jobs to have flexibility for working from home, and even some of the worst paying have decent insurance, including private disability insurance (which sucks to deal with long-term, but its way more money than SSDI). To get basically started there's a ton of free tools/courses online (nice to just see if its interesting to you, I can recommend a free course to try if you'd like), you can take community college classes (also a lot on line), bootcamps (again, a lot online), or go get a 'proper' comp sci degree. I'm self taught, proud holder of a GED 🧐,"
"and besides being sick, I never had trouble finding work in 20 years. I've worked on distributed teams, worked entirely remotely, worked from home part/most of the week, etc. Tons of possibilities. There's contract/freelance too if you're up for it."

"[1] That's what I used to do, but I opted for disability, which hasn't happened yet. I may have to restart the process soon. In the meantime I've been trying to find work again and it hasn't been easy - but that has more to do with me than the industry. I'm autistic and my professional network has collapsed since I got too sick to work so interviewing has been especially hellish for me nowadays."
My advice is if you can and you like your job sit down and. explain that your illness is progressing and you would appreciate. any accommodation to work from home some days. And a plan moving forward. This way you can maintain your pay. If you are dealing with a chronic illness I think they have to provide reasonable accommodations. Research your legal rights. I had to quit b/c I got Lyme disease on top of my AI conditions. I wish I could do that job for them part time if I were to get a little better but after so long everyone that knew me is gone. Here is a site that had quality part time for flex jobs in case you want to leave. Hope it helps! [https://www.flexjobs.com](https://www.flexjobs.com)
I needed this too. Thanks for the link!
I have no tears at all and I can still use daily lenses. I use a brand with extra moisture - they consist of 98% water. When I've worn them a couple of hours I do need to use eye drops once in a while and if I'm very tired in the evening I have to remove them completely. Other than that it works perfectly fine for me.
"I use scleral contact lenses. They're a rigid gas permeable lense that are big enough to extend out to the sclera (the whites) of your eyes. They dome out a little so that when you insert them you fill them with saline and they trap that layer of saline against your eye rather than wicking out moisture like a lot of soft contacts. I find that I can wear them a full day comfortably but I do get protein buildup on the surface that sometimes makes me have to take them out, clean them, and put them back in- presumably because of the lack of tears to wash that junk away."


"Also, they're expensive. They cost me $750 for the pair, and you have to use vials of preservative free 100% sterile saline, which is more expensive than regular saline. Also, my opthamologist sort of made it sound like I would have them for several years before I needed a new pair, making the upfront cost not as bad when compared to continually buying my custom toric soft contacts. But I've had them about 2 years and they have started to become pretty uncomfortable, so I definitely need new ones."


TL;DR: I'd recommend scleral lenses if you can afford them.
Can you tell us the actual brand please?
Wow I had no idea that these contacts even existed!!
"It's ""Moist"" from Acuview."
We have goggles in the kitchen for this.
"If my eyes are particularly dry that day, yes super sensitive to onions. I have to use extra eye drops before chopping, and it’s still a searing pain sometimes."
I love onions and am not overly sensitive to the sulphur that causes the eye irritation.
If someone is in the other room chopping onions my eyes start to burn but I don't get tears - this explains so much!
The smell of raw onions makes want to vomit badly.  Takes very little to set me off.
Smart! I thought about getting some for this exact reason honestly.
Glad I'm not alone. Freaking onions man. I usually freeze them before chopping
I may have to try that. It can be super painful sometimes !
"Yeah freezing them makes the irritation stop completely for me, but you need a super sharp knife, cause they are harder to cut. Food processors also help, because it limits the time you have to spend chopping the onions."
"Right now I'm all about pre-chopping and freezing onions, green onions and celery. Otherwise they go bad too fast for me to use them. And it's so much more convenient not to have to chop veggies for 1/2 hour before every single meal."
That's smart! The only reason I freeze them first is to prevent the irritation.
"The same thing happened to me at work on November 13th. (I just had a perfect vision exam in July). Along with this, I had severe light sensitivity so badly that I had to wear my sunglasses all day long, even indoors. I immediately made an eye appointment for two days later. The doctor ran some tests and told me my corneas were severely scratched. He prescribed me Prednisolone eye drops (to put in every hour) and Neomycin Ophthalmic Ointment (to put in at bedtime). Neither of these helped at all. I went back to him 10 days later, and he told me to continue the drops but stop the ointment. Still no change. Finally, after 3 visits to him in a month, he referred me to a retina specialist for December 18th to check for retina damage that he might not be able to see."

"The specialist was in the room for about 4 minutes, told me there was nothing wrong with my retinas, laughed at the original ophthalmologist’s diagnosis of scratched corneas, and said I likely have diabetes or had a mini stroke. He suggested I get a physical. So that’s what I did on December 27th."

"This physician ruled out a stroke immediately, thank goodness. He ordered bloodwork and wrote on my symptoms “joint pain”, which I didn’t originally complain to him about because I just figured that was from being slightly overweight and sedentary. He said that my insurance would cover the cost of the ANA test if he wrote that down, so I didn’t argue. I had 7 vials of blood taken. Since it was the weekend and New Years, I didn’t get an answer for another week. The doctor called and told me that my bloodwork came back positive for an autoimmune disorder suggestive of Sjögren’s. I had never heard of that, but upon reading about the symptoms, it started to make sense, as I have a dry mouth and nose also. He referred me to a rheumatologist, but that appointment isn’t until June (as I’ve read is typical for it to take up to 6 months to get in)."

"I watched a lady’s video on YouTube (can’t remember her name) and she mentioned that changing to a keto lifestyle has improved her symptoms. I had been thinking about giving keto a try, and this gave me the final push I needed. I started on January 6th. Within the first week, I was able to take my sunglasses off indoors. My vision has improved by at least 80%. I still have slightly blurry vision, but nothing like I had at first. I should note that I stare at a computer for 8 hours at work every day. I did buy some blue light blocking nonprescription glasses that I’ve used for 3 days now, and they are fantastic. I ordered those off of Zenni Optical."

"I hope this helps. I only recently started following this sub, but I think you have come to the right place."
Yes! When I had dry eyes I used to have blurred vision at times and lights at night were the worst. I would see halos galore.

"I recently wrote an [article](https://vitalityjuicer.com/dry-eye/) on dry eye and what helped me, you may find it useful."
"I use viscotears during the day, rinse out my eyes before bedtime with 5% nacl and use oculac tears to open my eyes more gently in the morning. I have very dry eyes."
please check your eyes frequently. i didnt and now i have glaucoma :( its not rare in my family but sjögrens surely worsened my eyes.

"Dont skip articifal tears, even if you have no symptomps at all. thats what i would recommend. and see a doctor asap."
"Dry eye can cause what it sounds like you are describing. If your eyes clear when you blink and then go almost immediately blurry again, dry eye is in play. Screen  time is a big culprit, too."
"im in this position now, except no insurance or money for test and appointments, im thinking about going keto, i dont have much else to lose honestly, idk much about it though so im going to have to research more. Any updates on your health and diet since this post ??"
"I'm still doing keto, going on 10 weeks. My eyes do feel better these days. I only occasionally put drops in now. I still wear the glasses every day. Sorry about your insurance situation. I do have insurance, and still pay an arm and leg, so I can't imagine. Give Keto a try. There's plenty of information on Reddit. And it's free!"
Happy Cake Day!
Link?
thanks!
"Whoops, sorry! [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1804598](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1804598)"
"Sjögrens is associated with defeciencies in vitamine D, B12 and iron. Supplements have been a great help to me!"
I use stimulants. Plaquenil was useless and caused pigmentation issues for me after a few years.
"Some doctors are amenable to using a stimulant to keep you awake. I use vyvanse and have no trouble on days when I take it. Before I was worried I was going to fall asleep while driving. Make sure you emphasize that it's dangerous for you to be sleepy, driving, walking, slow reaction time, you could literally die if you aren't alert."
"Get on Plaquenil, it’s a drug for Sjogrens. It helps with fatigue."
Try meditation and yoga  and ask to your doctor if he can prescribe hormones like testosterone for man or another one for woman.  I used to have the same problem but as a man I take a shot of nebido every three months.
"I would look into a sleep study.  Idiopathic hyposomnia is sometimes an effect of Sjogren's and you might be able to get a drug like modifinil to help you.  I think you would be a better case for stimulants since you're young, and there isn't the potential medical judgement issues that occurs with post-menopausal women."
"Can you explain more about ""pigmentation issues"" ?"
Thank you for answering!
"Yes, both."

"For ears - I sometimes put 2-3 drops of extra virgin olive oil in my ears. This is a woo-woo method that not everyone is cool with, but it has helped me. I let it sit in my ear for a little bit, then flip over and let it drain. Clean gently with a q tip. Helps when my ears hurt and can help to dislodge guck, sometimes. Also a good idea to see an ear doctor - even just a place that does free hearing tests might have some ideas."

"My teeth are fairly bad, see a dentist as often as you can. You can try sensodyne, but I try not to use it for long periods. I use SLS free toothpaste and when my electric toothbrush feels too harsh I use a kid's soft bristle brush. Swishing with warm water before and after can help a tiny bit. But generally I try to just buck up and brush anyway, if your teeth are really sensitive you might have something like very worn enamel and need to see a dentist anyway. Restoring mouthwash supposedly helps some too."
"I also experience crunching sounds in my ears (mostly left)! I went to my primary since I thought it might be some wax build up and he said it was most likely TMJ and I’m hearing my jaw. Not sure if that’s the case, but I haven’t found any remedies, unfortunately."
"I get fluid build-up in my inner ears. It’s due to the Eustachian tubes not draining properly. I use nasal saline spray twice a day, and every time I do it I pop my ears to get some of the fluid to get back there...a few little pops and then open my jaw a few times. I still get some fluid build-up in there from time to time, but the saline and popping helps. Otherwise when you’ve had fluid in there for a long time it gets really thick and doesn’t drain out easily. My ear that gets bad is my bad Sjogren’s side...that eye is dryer, and that’s the side my parotid gets the most swollen. I don’t have an ear wax etc issue...mine is internal and I had to see an ENT for advice on what to do...wouldn’t be a bad idea to see one."
"The only ear issue I have is super dry flaky itchy skin in my ears. I have ""wet"" earwax so that's not it. I dab a tiny bit of vaseline on my pinky fingertip and moisturize it when it gets bad. My teeth are crap too. I'm starting the process of fixing them one tooth at a time because of garbage dental insurance."
Thank you! Can you go into detail on your ear symptoms? Do you have the crunching and whatnot?
"I also have minor tmj, but this occurs more in eardrum itself as opposed to the jaw (1-2 inches apart). If I “blink hard” I can trigger it, whereas my tmj Is triggered with jaw movement"
"Thanks for sharing. Once it's gummed up in there, how do you get it out? I think that's what I'm experiencing. Feels like when you have water in your ears."
"Tell me about the wet earwax, if you don't mind. My ears used to have the dry kind until I got this condition."
"I don't really get what you mean by crunching. I have wet earwax (some people have dry earwax, it depends on your genetics/ethnic background) so I just get what seems like excess earwax and it's itchy and feels full, sort of like when you've got allergies and it always feels like there's boogers in your nose. It just feels thicker and stickier than I remember it ever being. Maybe like since it's drier it's more concentrated/thicker. Much harder to properly clean."
"I had to use a steroid nose spray for a couple weeks, and lots and lots of steam. Finally, they cleared. When you use any kind of nose spray, direct the spray kind of towards the side so it shoots over closer to your ears, and then pop your ears. Some of the spray will get back there and start to loosen things up. After they clear, make sure to continue to use some kind of nose spray, I use Xlear, to keep them from getting bad again. Mine originally started after an ear infection...but the fluid should clear in a few weeks, and mine lasted for a year 🙄 Now, I can hear the fluid building up again every so often, but it clears more quickly. My ENT told me it’s safe to pop your ears throughout the day. I just do mini pops."
"It's just slightly sticky, no odor or color really. Hard to describe. It never really caused a problem or had to be cleaned medically. I try not to mess with my ears, I got scolded for losing a q-tip tip in my ear and having to have a nurse fish it out."
"Thank you! I have been dealing with this for 2 years! I fear that the fluid might be too vicious/sticky at this point to clear. I wish they could just go in and 'suck' it out, as the nasal spray actually triggers a flare in and of itself!"


I can feel it starting in my less-problematic side now too.


It sounds almost like water in ear right? ugh. Thanks for sharing. Did they suggest any other options for you?


"I've been through Stanford, UCSF, and other ENTs; I found that I have to guide my doctors to things, they don't go that route on their own :/"
"Heya, can you share your steam process?"
"Yes, like when I’d lean forward I could hear it sloshing around in there. The ENT confirmed that there was fluid in there just by looking in my ears. All they can do for fluid on the inside is put tubes in and then it’ll be forced to drain. They gave me an RX for oral steroids, but I didn’t take them. They offered to put tubes in for me, but I wanted to try longer to get them clear myself."
"Sure! A handheld nebulizer works the best... that, plus I order the nebulizer saline packets from Amazon. You could make your own saline too. Breathe in through the nose. It’s great to have around for when you’re sick too, so a good thing to have."
"Thanks for the followup. Why did you decline the oral steroids? Fear of long-term eye damage? I have been using oral dexamethasone, but it hasn't helped the ears."
"Nah. I’m just really stubborn, and wanted to try some other methods before taking something."
I would recommend seeing a dermatologist for (1) and for dry skin. I use CeraVe which for me has been the best of everything.

Generally I avoid anything with SLS as it seems to aggravate my skin. Look at the body wash and shampoo you're using. I like Renpure and my skin looks better than it has in a long time with plaquenil + Renpure + CeraVe.

Take a fish oil supplement too. I really think this helps.

Your doctor should at least put you on plaquenil as far as I know? I think it helps some but I definitely still feel symptoms.
"30F here, diagnosed at the tail end of 27."

"1. I had this happen too, except I let mine get a little worse than I should have.  In the end I had really flaky skin that was red and started to weep (I know, sorry, gross). In a last ditch effort to not have to try a prescription shampoo I tried [Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength](https://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Clinical-Seborrheic-Dermatitis/dp/B0043OSIVM) and it was like night and day! If you've got really brittle hair you may need to work with a dermatologist on this, though.  This shampoo is REALLY caustic, but when I pair it with a decent leave in conditioner my hair looks better than it ever has."
2. Try a cocoa butter based lotion.  I like [CocoaBeautiful](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cocoa-Beautiful-Cocoa-Butter-Rich-Cream-Lotion-17-fl-oz/36717978?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=3482&adid=22222222227000000000&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=42423897272&wl4=pla-51320962143&wl5=9026834&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=36717978&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0brtBRDOARIsANMDykbasfPwmiwwvyNzuMY-kjW9Ye_sugBI-4w9qB9IPtHuZK1iLFICw14aAsSZEALw_wcB) at walmart.  You're going to have to be seriously diligent about applying lotion. Its just one of the lesser known symptoms of Sjogrens.  I apply after every shower (and before bed in the winter/dry season) and I keep lotion in my purse for my hands after every hand wash.
"3. Talk to your doctor about pilocarpine.  My rheumatologist prescribed it to me for up to 4 times per day and I started with just once in the morning and eventually added one more at night. Its made a HUGE different for me.  I had the mucus issue that you have, but I also developed a dry cough that I couldn't kick and the pilocarpine fixed both.  I still keep the biotene spray in my purse for emergency issues, but I rarely need it now unless I have a really bad flare-up."

"So, I don't want to be a dick about this, but you really do need to prepare yourself for the reality of your situation regarding doctor's visits.  I see my rheumatologist 4 times per year, my optometrist twice per year (to check for retinal damage from the plaquenil), a neurologist once per year to watch for signs that my sjogren's caused neuropathy is worsening, and I get dental cleanings 3-4 times per year because low saliva production can cause increased plaque and gum decay.  On top of that, I found that even with treatment it became very difficult for me to keep up with all of the things that I was doing before, especially at work, because of the fatigue.  I don't know how I could have functioned without an army of doctors helping me with suggestions for my issues."

"At the very least I have to strongly urge you to find a better rheumatologist to help you get to the point where you're maintaining your sjogrens symptoms bearably.  You almost certainly need to be on medications (probably starting with plaquenil) and you need to have your vitamin levels checked as that many autoimmune patients don't process dietary vitamins (especially Vitamin D) as well.  Sjogrens can cause brain fog and fatigue, but Sjogrens + low Vitamin D was way, way worse for me.  If your doctor is not taking your concerns seriously its time to move on, no matter how many times it takes.  I know it doesn't feel that simple, especially if you're living in a rural area where there aren't many options, but spending money on a doctor who isn't helping you is not just demoralizing, its pointless."
"I have used an aloe Vera shampoo (organic) ,that I get in line, for years now for psoriasis related to my sjoegrens. Doesn’t cure it but successfully holds it at bay. If I have a breakout I’ll use a coal tar shampoo -  very occasionally - and that’s good for ages. Some people freak out about coal tar, but the amount in the shampoo and used infrequently is not going to cause a problem. I also find hair washing frequently, but definitely not every day is good. Every other day for me. If I left it any longer the problem is exacerbated.  Hope info this helps a bit"
Hi! I was diagnosed at 26(now 28). I'm glad you got diagnosed now so they have some sort of treatment plan for you!

Here's what works for me:

Eczema(on my scalp): I used a random shampoo but rubbing triamcinolone after showering helped me.
"Dry mouth: Take sips of water often. Biotene at night. I'd wake up with dry throat and nearly pass out from coughing. Also I heard a humidifier works wonders. I also developed a lot of cavities due to dry mouth so be mindful about this! If your nose ever gets dry, vaseline works for me."
Dry skin: Jergens Ultra Healing Lotion and Eucerin. I heard Cerave is a God send too.

"For the thick mucus, have you taken anything for allergies? That might be separate from Sjogren's. I live out in the desert and I get that during allergy season."
"Try tea tree shampoo. I use the Yes to brand, and it is the only thing that helps the itching for me."

"Pre-diagnosis, I got a lot of tonsil stones. Make sure to drink water with meals to wash everything down.  It has helped me."
"Have you tried olive oil masks on your hair? Soak olive oil on your hair (be generous) and scalp for 20-30 minutes before showering, and see if it helps. You can add a little lavender or tea tree oil to it. I’d ask for an RX for Evoxac...I can’t believe no one has given you one yet 🤦🏻‍♀️ You could try sleeping with Xylimelt discs in your mouth too."
"1. Seems like many, many sjoggies have some co-habitating issues to deal with. The one i see most often is sebhorreic dermatitis. Ll, which is most likely what is causing your scalp itch. Sometimes it shows up in your eyebrows, too, or even behind your ears. Make an appointment with a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and write a script for ciclopirox shampoo and ciclopirox topical gel. OTC shampoos won't cut this one, at least not for very long. Google it for pictures, but don't freak out. I don't know many sjoggies who get it as bad as in the pics, usually it's mild and annoying, but the shampoo will keep it under control 98% of the time."
"2. Face moisturizer: Clinique moisture surge. Go to Ulta or Sephora, they'll give you a sample size to try it out before you pay for it. Hands: eucerin rich hand lotion. This stuff is thick. Fantastic. Put it on under gloves. Comes in a big tub if you get it from Amazon."

3. I don't have any advice for this one! Sorry!

Good luck!
"My tonsil stones completely stopped once I stopped using xiidra eyedrops. Are you on these by any chance? They were so disgusting and I was coughing them up almost daily, some were extremely large and caused me to automatically regurgitate with no control."
"2nd the Cerave. That stuff works wonders, along with Aquafor."
"He didn't put me on anything. My primary care doctor didn't listen to me about my concerns and suspicions. She did test me for Sjogrens (after three other general and non-pointed blood tests) and then never bothered to call me back about those test results. When I called her, the receptionist said everything was fine and she didn't need to see me. So I went to a rheumatologist since one of my biggest symptoms was joint pain and he did blood work and told me it was glaringly obvious that I had Sjogrens and he didn't know how my PCP could miss that. So now I'm on the lookout for a new PCP, but I've already missed so much work and spent so much money on tests and doctors bills, I don't know when I will be able to afford another doctor visit."
"Plaquenil may help with fatigue but as far as I know it doesn't actually help with dryness? (someone correct me if I'm wrong) Plus, after 5 years you risk retinal toxicity which may take you off of it if you start to show signs. So I'm not sure everyone needs to be on Plaquenil, especially right away."
"Hi! First, thank you so much for all the advice! I'll have to check on the shampoo, though, because my hair is brittle due to my Hashimotos. I'll definitely check the lotion and speak to my doctor about pilocarpine."

"I just wanted to clarify though, that my rheumatologist isn't a bad doctor at all, so far he has been great. My PCP was horrible, so I went around her and went to my dad's rheumatologist, who is who diagnosed me. We have a follow up appt in a few months but he wanted to see, since my symptoms arent extreme yet--just annoying, if OTC stuff would work first. He gave me the assurance that if I find myself unable to deal with symptoms that way, to call him and he'd get me in to see him to figure out a plan from here. He also said he would be glad to refer me to my dermatologist or ENT of choice if I would like. The issue is taking off time for appts. I know it may become a necessity in the (near) future,  but if I'm able to manage without more drs appts, copays and tests, I'd like to. Money is spread really thin for me atm. My doctors copays tend to be around $20-40 depending on the doctor, and that's a couple days of food for me right now, you know?"
thanks!
"I also live in the desert, but I don't have any allergy symptoms here (as opposed to when I visit family in the PNW and get smacked with allergies). I was put on a nose spray back before I was diagnosed to help, and it didn't help, it just dried out my (obviously). I've tried Claritin, zyrtec, benadryl, allegra, all of that before but now my doctor who diagnosed me said it was most likely the Sjogrens. Because it's not phlegm, and it's not sinus drain. It's literally my saliva becoming thick. My mouth will feel like it's full of saliva but if I swallow, it will form almost a seal around my throat, which leads to the gagging."
"I had a positive ANA for 7 years and the doctor never mentioned it. When I finally got hold of my own blood work (they put it online!) I asked her about it and she said, ""It's always a false positive."" I asked, ""For seven years?!"" Needless to say, I found a new doctor the next day, had a diagnosis a week after that first visit. PCPs aren't always on top of everything, sadly."
I just meant for symptoms in general.

From what I was told the retinal toxicity is super rare and you just need to keep getting tested every year for it. I guess if you did run into issues with it they would take you off. But from what I understand it helps slow the progression of the symptoms.
"Plaquenil helps with inflammation, which can help with the fatigue and also the dryness."
I understand. I just wanted to set your expectations because I have seen so many people in the autoimmune community living with a very low quality of life because they dont prioritize getting help. It sounds like you have it more under control than I thought at first.

"If you check over on /r/autoimmune there is a discord channel that started out for lupus patients but is now open to all auto immune for ranting, support, etc.  If I remember when I get to my computer I'll add a link to this comment."
"I don’t have this symptom, but I wonder if using xylitol products like gum or mints or lozenges would help to stimulate saliva flow and thin it out as a result. You can also ask your doc about prescriptions that stimulate saliva. Also talk to your dentist about it because it seems like he/she might have some tips."
Gotcha. My doctors stressed the retinal toxicity thing to me but I may be at an increased risk due to other eye problems. Thanks for the info!
"Long time Sjogren's sufferer with RA and fibro, but don't have PA.   I do have a lot of stiffness that comes on without warning or provocation.  In my back right now.  I keep heating pads at work and home.  God bless heated car seats.  I do get the lump under the tongue thing 3 or 4 times a year.  You can literally see it.  Kind of freaky.  Sometimes sucking on ice helps that until it passes.  Benzocaine throat lozenges under the tongue help also.  There's no strong evidence I've read about familial tendency for SS, though autoimmune diseases in general seem to be.   There is so much overlap in diseases it's a wonder any of us get correctly diagnosed.  The cold hands could be Raynaud's syndrome.  I don't have that disease, but I do get cold hands quite a bit.  It could be that's just the way you are.   My rheumatologist avoids shaking people's hands because his hands are grim reaper cold.  Every time I used to complain about mine, he'd put his hand on the back of my hand and say ""it could be worse"".  It worked, I stopped complaining.  Saline rinses (I use Neil rinse) helps my dry, swollen sinuses.  I get sick of just water all the time, so I drink Gatorade G2 light sometimes.  It's a significantly reduced sugar formula that I buy in bulk powder form and dilute even more.  I just want some taste and hate diet drink after taste.   Sugar should be your mortal enemy if you have dry mouth.  A lot of SS patients have significant cavity problems because of the disease.  Hope you find some relief and some answers to your questions."
"I have sjogrens and psoriatic arthritis!! First off, I'm so sorry for what you are going through. Second a lot of your symptoms could be caused by either or of these conditions, but now that your mother has been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease  you can really force your doctors to test you for all of them (one close family member significantly ups your probability for all auto immune conditions). I will also say I had a ton of eye issues until I got put on Cosyntex, now no eye issues!! (Sensitive to lights, itchy, watery, sometimes super dry in sunlight). So yes push your doctors to test you for other autoimmune diseases now that you have family history (do not just let them test your ANA that is not an appropriate test anymore and any rhuem worth their degree will know this!)"

"Good luck and feel free to message me, you're not alone!"
"i have sjogrens, and just in the last couple of months i have developed psorisis on my scalp and back, i kinda thought it might have been from plaquenil, who knows, its probably all related. Pretty much all the symptoms you have mentioned i also have, i wear sunglasses nearly always outside now. Have you had a lip biopsy? im assuming your ana is negative"
"When I was first diagnosed I mainly had similar symptoms to you - fatigue, frequent Costochondritis (inflammation around the ribs/sternum), globus sensation (which I think may have been mild dryness + acid reflux), other widespread pain. My eyes didn't bother me at all and I don't remember any significant dry mouth issues."

The dry eyes / mouth took a few more years to really kick in but I've got the whole package now.
"I was diagnosed with Sjogren's without the dryness. My initial symptoms were constant chest pain and it felt like I have the flu all the time. It took them a year to figure out it was Sjogren's, and one year from that, I developed the dry mouth but it comes in waves aka ""flare ups"". I was shocked when I was diagnosed because I didnt have the typical obvious symptoms of dryness. But now I do! I've got the whole package as @agedashitofu had stated in their comment."

"Keep in mind that a lot of our symptoms match a lot of symptoms for other autoimmune diseases(like Lupus for example). I developed Raynaud's syndrome in between this all, so just keep a heads up that we've got diseases that can pair up with this one."
I have sjogrens and no dry mouth issues (my eyes are pretty dry though.)
I used to have issues with a very dry mouth but thanks to dietary changes these issues have almost completely dissapeared.

I have no issues with my eyes. So I do think it's possible to not have dryness issues with Sjogrens or these issues are so small that they don't appear as a problem. Which is usually the case with Sjogrens a lot of things that are abnormal but too small to really notice.
"Positive for both SS-A and SS-B but no dryness sore joints whatsoever. Twice a year checkups with the rheumatologist and lots of blood tests to stay on top of things and make sure nothing goes wonky.  SS-B antibodies have increased a few fold these past months, but other than abnormal blood results, no classic Sjogrens symptoms."

I do have bad Raynaud's however.
I have every symptom imaginable but dry eyes and dry mouth.
"I have ssa antibodies and I get dry mouth and dry eyes a lot. Tight muscles, fatigue, itchy skin."
Same!
Interesting. I am definitely in the early stages where it is hard to easily give a diagnosis. The wait and watch method to see progression seems to be the only option. I have only had these symptoms for a year so far.

Are you on anything to manage the symptoms?
What dietary changes did you make?
itchy skin was a HUGE initial symptom for me. same with muscle tightness in my joints. not necessarily pain but definitely tightness.
Sort of...

"My rheumatologist said he could prescribe some things if I wanted to try them, but he felt that the side effects would be worse than my symptoms are at this point so we’re just working on managing things as much as possible."

"Most of the time my symptoms are just a bit bothersome. It’s only during a flare up that I really remember “oh right, my immune system is an asshole”."

"I’ve cut some triggers out of my diet. I bought a fancy Venta humidifier for the living area of our house and smaller humidifiers for the bedroom and office. I use biotene mouthwash and similar products for dry mouth. I have tear eye drops on hand at all times, and a eye mask that I warm up and wear for 10 minutes or so as needed when they are really dry. My eye doctor prescribed a medicated spray to use on my eyes but I haven’t used it in a while and haven’t noticed a difference."

"Prescription pain killers make me feel miserable so I used to take a ton of ibuprofen and tylenol, but started taking cbd about two years ago and found it helped immensely with the daily aches and pains. It helped me sleep better as well which in turn made me feel better overall. Shortly after we became a legal state so I started trying different cannabis products and have been managing my pain with it almost entirely. I use it almost every night and sometimes during the day when I’m having a flare."

"I know that’s not for everyone, but I’ve found it to be better personally than how I feel on painkillers or what constantly taking ibuprofen does to my stomach. It doesn’t help everything - I went with the prescribed vicodin when I had surgery last year - but for the day-to-day muscle and joint aches or inflammation I’ve found it does the trick."
"gluten free bread, no grain oatmeal but buckwheat grains, steamed broccoli/brusselsprouts, more meat instead of carbohydrates. more garlic and nuts, salads with salmon, coconut milk/juice"

"no sugary drinks, no chocolate, no crips or candy/sweets,  fast food I focus on heavy meat foods or pure non gluten like french fries"

"My diet was pretty bland from the start and it still is. But I tightened it (less sugar and produced foods) and replaced all gluten products with non-gluten replacements. Every day I mostly eat chicken/beef, potatoes, buckwheat oatmeals, 4-8 slices of gluten free bread with chorizo meat or something else (regular butter, probably needs to be soy), salads and steamed veggies mostly broccoli with the supplements mentioned before."

"paleo, gluten-free or keto all seem"

"B12, broccoli (and other vegetables)and gluten-free have been the biggest improvements. B12 for mental fog and tiredness, brocolli for inflammatory glands and saliva production, gluten-free for stomach and bowels issues."
"I have areas of what feels like contracted/tight muscles in my jaw, foot, hamstrings, forearm, calf and ribcage (geez, pretty much listed everything!) and to stretch them or open my mouth wide or even take a deep breath takes a lot of effort and they are slow to expand. Is that similar to you (or anyone else)? Each flair seems to add a new area of tightness that never really leaves."
"Wow, thanks so much!! I have been dairy and gluten free for a long time. But I just started realizing I eat a ton of legumes - a lot of chickpeas, green peas, and peanuts 😬 I’m going to try to replace those things with more meats and vegetables. Thanks for the inspiration!"
"Glad you've got a plan that works!  How long on this diet before you noticed improvement? I was told to eliminate gluten, dairy, eggs.  Did that with about 90% success rate for about 4 weeks. Didn't notice any changes aside from my skin being clearer. (Dairy = acne.) Embraced the gluten once again when I went travelling as there were few other options.  No changes."

Eliminating gluten was the naturopath's idea.  I had never felt bloated or anything with it before.
When I was first diagnosed or first had problems i had extreme chest tightness and also tightness in many more areas then i do right now. I'm so lucky most of my painful and scary / uncomfortable symptoms went away. I was diagnosed 2 years ago. Took a year and 100 Dr visits / tests to figure it out.
Have you tried the Autoimmune Protocol?
"I had clear signs of gluten intolerance: stomach aches, bloated stomach, gassy diarrea like symptons. Noticeably difference on the day itself. If you had no stomach and bowel issues i doubt you had a gluten intolerance. My bowel movement was much better on the day itself and ever since ive had only issues on the days were i did eat some gluten products. Its difficult to buy non-gluten products in most parts of my country so I have to sometimes eat something that I dont want.."
It’s a weird relief to hear that many have what I’ve been experiencing - and wondering if it was just in my head! It’s a lingering symptom even when the neuropathy all over calms down. I’m going in for my lip biopsy next week and am curious what they will find. As I get closer to a diagnosis I feel lighter and heavier simultaneously. It’s a lot to digest so maybe it’s good that it takes some time. It’s been about 9 months of tests and doctors to get to this point.
"No, I haven’t. I need to try it...I’ve tried to cut out grains before, and it’s really hard for me, so that’s why I haven’t done it."
"I did! I ended up having surgery on one eye: besides the swelling, my eyes were going crossed. I wasn't born that way, but I started getting double vision and frequent monster headaches in my mid 20s! The surgery was successful a few years ago, and I'm back to ""only"" having other Sjogrens symptoms like dry eyes/throat/everything else and muscle troubles."

EDITED to add: I didn't know I had Sjogrens at the time! My biggest problems were headaches and blurred vision so I saw the eye doctors and neuro-ophthalmologists. I only later made it to a rheumatologist.

This may not be your exact issue so keep reading and good luck!
Did the test come up as “ganglion cell layer thickness: diffuse loss”?
"I have this and when I research it it says it’s common in glaucoma, and my doc says it’s due to my autoimmune disease."
"Thank you so much for this information. I also get the blurred vision and headaches- these issues prompted the eye exam but you’ve pretty much confirmed what I was thinking- more in-depth testing is needed. I’ve been to an ENT for the salivary glands and she told me to drink more water and to suck lemon drops. My dentist, same thing. I feel some thing is wrong and no one is listening to me. At least now I have some concrete evidence. I will make an appointment with an ophthalmologist in the upcoming week and see my PCP for some bloodwork as well."
Thank you.
"Was the surgery to correct the inflamed nerve, or your eyes crossing? Or both? I’m curious because I also have intermittent issues with my left eye. It started - or at least was first found - when I was 25, but I wasn’t diagnosed with Sjögrens until I was 29."

"I’ve never been treated for it because both doctors I’ve seen for it either acted like it was nothing or acted like I was dying. The dramatic one only wanted to give me a pill that he admitted had awful side effects and most of his patients couldn’t take it because of them. The swelling comes and goes, and has mostly been gone since my Sjögrens has been in remission."

"EDIT: Fixed “survey” to be “surgery.” “A” for effort, autocorrect."
"I kind of run the same way - throat is much, much dryer than the front of my mouth.   My other quirk is that my sub-mandibular glands are more swollen than my parotids.  I at least tested positive for SS-A which facilitated the diagnosis."
Probably your sublingual gland works fine. I’m the same way. My Rheumy only prescribed pilocarpine. It makes me nauseous.
I am not diagnosed as my blood is negative for everything but I still have dryness all over my tongue and the roof of my mouth just like OP. Recently my TMJ is hurting me so much when I eat :(((
I have the exact same thing. 🤷🏻‍♀️
"My submandibular glands are troublesome for me too. Parotida were fine, until recently. I don't have any real trouble with them yet, but when the subs flare up, I feel awfully aware of them, and you know, it's worrisome."
"My throat got so dry I could barely swallow food, and every time I started to salivate (or attempted to salivate) I'd feel like I was getting stabbed in the parotid gland (kind of in front of and just beneath the ear). My eyes have always been dry, along with cracked flaky lips, dry skin, etc."

My primary doc didn't think I had sjogrens - tried to blame my dry mouth on a medication I've been on for 15 years with no problems - but I asked her to run a sjogren's panel anyway and sure enough it came back sky-high.

"Referred to rheumatologist who diagnosed me with sjogrens and lupus (i had many more mystery symptoms that had either been completely ignored by my doctors or prompted them to run exhaustive cancer workups, including huge lymph nodes, morning stiffness, joint pain and photosensitivity)."
"If you have insurance coverage, ask for a sjogren's panel to be run. It's just a simple blood test, and it will help point you in the right direction for treatment."
I actually found out about my Sjogrens diagnosis backwards.

"According to my rheumatologist usually a patient comes in with a complaint about dry eyes/mouth, they get sent to a specialist to objectively confirm decreased function, and then a blood test to confirm the Sjogrens markers."

"For me, I went to a chiropractor about my joint issues, who sent me to a Nurse Practitioner friend who listened to all of my complaints. The NP then tested my blood for everything from thyroid problems to pituitary issues, etc.  The Sjogren's antibody happened to be one of them, and when that came back positive the NP sent me to a rheumatologist.  The rheumatologist then sent me for a schrimer's test (dry eye test), which came back normal, and a test of my salivary glands, which came back abnormal.  Voila, I was diagnosed, according to the rheumatologist."

"Dry eyes/mouth were not my initial complaints going in. In fact, I didn't notice the abnormal function until it was pointed out to me because I just assumed that it was normal.  My main symptoms were extreme joint pain, migraines, brain fog, and exhaustion.  Turns out I've been living with Sjogrens long enough that it had been attacking my cartilage in my hands and at some point I've torn the meniscus in each of my knees."

"I would say have the blood testing and see.  I mean, it could be negative and you're back at square one, or it could be positive and you might be able to get on a treatment plan that will help with your symptoms."
"As Sjogren's is developing, symptoms can come on gradually. I had none of the classic symptoms at first, then eventually got them all."
"Also, it is not uncommon for people with autoimmune disorders to wind up having more than one of them. You can have Sjogren's and Lupus, for instance."
"Your doctor keeps asking about dry mouth, because then they would send you for a lip biopsy which is a more definitive test. If you don't develop dryness other than your eyes, it is probably not Sjogren's."
Your symptoms make me wonder if you are developing scleroderma. (This can also cause dry eyes and eye problems. Esophagus problems are also common.)
"As far as short term relief for dry eyes, I swear by Systane Ultra eye drops. There are also ""goopier"" gel-type drops for nighttime, but I personally haven't had much success with those."
"If your condition is that bad, an opthalmologist familiar with autoimmune disorders is a good option. (My eye doctor actually has helped with my symptoms more than my rheumatologist.)"
"I wish you good luck, and I sincerely hope it is not Sjogren's."
My dermatologist did blood testing for a bunch of AI issues as she thought possibly Lupus. Had no idea what it was at the time. Thought my dry mouth was from all of the allergy medicine I was taking.  Blood test confirmed (then eye test to second it)
"My right hand started hurting (it was thumb and middle finger to be exact) went to see my PCP, she wasn't available so I went to another Dr in the office. She ordered a blood test and found out 3 days later. I went to a rheumatologist and he confirmed it. total of 2 weeks to get diagnosed"
"I was being treated for RA. My body was not responding to any medications except badly. About 4 years of this I noticed my extreme dry mouth. I’ve always had issues with dry eyes. I’m an oncology nurse in an outpatient infusion setting and had given MAB’s to one other Sjögrens patient and started recognizing the symptoms. Sure enough! I have Sjögren syndrome. I’ve known for 3 years now. There are no medications left for me to take so 3 years ago I got my medical cannabis card. I smoke flower daily and it has made a HUGE difference in my disease process. I saw my rheum in January (he was dubious of me using cannabis) and he said “you look better and you are moving better than I’ve ever seen you. I guess I can’t argue!”  Then he told me he would see me in 1 year, as opposed to my usual every 6 months!  Good luck with your journey, try not to get discouraged; it takes the average person 4 years to finally get an autoimmune answer!"
My doctor thinks it's what I have due to my dry eyes/skin/mouth. I have bilateral joint pain/swelling too so I don't know if its SS or RA or both. I don't see the rheumatologist until October so 🤷‍♀️
"My eye dr suggested it first, very dry eyes, also I have a history of salivary gland stones, blood work showed Sjogrens, and then the ENT did a lip biopsy when she did my surgery to flush my glands out. I have joint pain as well. I had a flare up so bad, I had no saliva at all, and couldn't eat anything with out choking for 3 weeks."
I’m so sorry to hear that
I didn't. My doctor ran a blood test and told me I had it.
"I had never heard of it, I was diagnosed by a rheumatologist after having a stroke and then a TIA, where no identifiable cause could be found. A neurologist who was evaluating me saw some concerning inflammation levels on a routine lab panel from my yearly physical and asked if I'd ever been evaluated for possible autoimmune diseases, as some of them can cause strokes. So I saw a rheumatologist, who ordered a lot of lab tests, went over my medical history, and my symptoms. She told me I have Sjogren's. and said that yes, it has been linked to strokes in some cases. So, it's a possible explanation."
"Working out shouldn't make you feel like that. Before I got sick, working out made me feel fabulous."
"Good to know! I actually wake myself up at night because I'm just swallowing over and over and over again.... To the point that it almost feels like I'm choking, but my mouth is totally dry."

"Thankfully, I have great medical insurance, so I'm really thinking about asking for the blood test."
"I'm insisting my doc run a sjogrens panel when I go in on Monday. Did you just have SS-A and SS-B run? Or others with it like ANA? Some of the non-specific ones I've already had run and they came back ""normal."""

I would have had the sjogrens panel run with it but apparently they didn't take enough sample. So they said just wait for the rheum. I'm not cool with waiting anymore and I have good insurance.
I went decades with muscle and joint pain and cognitive issues not even realizing that I had dry mouth. They need better training for sussing that out. Over and over I told them my dry eyes are better with wearing glasses.
I love Systane eye drops! Thank you so much for the information! I'm hoping to get some answers sooner than later.
I figured that I'd probably need some specific blood work. What kind of eye test did you have?
Wow!! That's fast!!!
"I'm happy to hear it helps!!! I got my card, but the MMJ made me really sick, I'm one of those people who are allergic to weed! Nice huh? I'm 48, and just had never smoked it, and I thought omg, so many people are having such good luck, and I got my card, and then got so sick from it, we worked the script around, tinkered with it, and nope. The higher the CBD, the worse it was. I have a hereditary autoimmune disease, Hereditary Angioedema edema, type 3 and anti inflammatories trigger it, so they are figuring it's why it didn't work for me. I was so disappointed."
"My mouth tends to get dry quickly, but I feel like my throat STAYS dry, if that makes any sense at all😂... I'm only 33 and in pretty good shape but have to hobble out of bed every morning🙄 The wildest thing about my eyes is that by the end of the day, my right eyelid in particular, is very noticably droopy--like it's just so thick that it can't support itself...it beats all I've ever seen. It's just got me all kind of messed up. My state doesn't have medical cannabis, so that wouldn't be an option for me, but I saw a research article taking about its benefits and it was super interesting."
"I never see much about people use medical marijuana for SS. This is probably a dumb question, but is there a certain kind that is best to try? Do you think it’s helping to reduce inflammation? Thanks, and I’m glad you’re feeling better :)"
Geeeezzz!! October is so far away😭
"That's exactly what I'm thinking! I got all my blood work done yesterday--my doctor seems to think that it'll probably come back positive for RA, Sjogrens, or some other inflammatory disease."
"Had to plead with my doctor to refer to a rheumatologist, because I was pretty sure it was Sjogren's. The rheumy didn't think Sjogren's was likely because I am male, but she ordered a lip biopsy and that confirmed it."

You are probably not going to get a Sjogren's diagnosis without getting a rheumatologist involved.
"My primary ran an ANA w/ titer and pattern, immunoglobulins panel (IGG, IGA and IGM), Sedimentation rate and a Rheumatoid factor in addition to the Sjogren's antibodies panel."

"My SSA(Ro)60 was pretty high, as was my Rheumatoid factor and ANA titer. Everything else was in normal range. You probably already know this, but you can have negative ANA and still have sjogrens, if you have positive SSA or SSB."
"Yes, absolutely! I stopped wearing contacts in college because they were too dry all the time!"
My eye doctor did a test with a little piece of paper. Placed it under my eye lid for lime 10 minutes. It shows the amount of tears your eyes produce. It was super easy and painless.  She prescribed eye meds for me but I found the Uber expensive medicine worked the same as over the counter.  I use it 2 times a day or extra if my eyes are really dry.  Best of luck to you!!!
After reading how some people took years to be diagnosed and seeing a bunch of Drs I was surprised. I feel bad for everyone that took forever to get a diagnosis. The plaquenil took like 6-8 months to start working. It still flares up from time to time but I just use Prednisone when it gets bad.
I know.. I'm a new patient so I sort of expected it. They dinked around with my referral for a good 2 months too. Didn't send it. Couldn't find it. Then I had to call to get the appointment rather than waiting on them.

ETA- don't even get me started on my doctor's office and their incompetence. My doc is an NP. She herself is nice and is the first person that has listened and done any digging into what may be bothering me. So I'm nervous to search again and get stuck unable to get in to anyone who listens. My last doc neglected to test far enough to find out I have hashis. Blamed all my stuff on depression. 🙃
"The bit about how many of us have small fiber neuropathy hasn't caught on everywhere. You might want to investigate that a bit before you go in. It's a separate dx but secondary to Sjogren's. Also, don't forget about the early Sjogren's antibody tests if your SSA and SSB are neg. (they are neg. in about half of us)."

Best of luck to you. It's a bumpy road but can usually be managed.
I am going to one. I just don't go in until Oct. New patient wait times suck. 🤷‍♀️

"I just want to go in with an idea. It would be nice to know why things are how they are, ya know? They were supposed to run these initially but ran out of blood sample. So it's not as if she was opposed to running them anyway."
Oh yeah. Many people have said their ANA was negative.  I appreciate the info! I'm so glad for reddit in cases like this so I can connect with people who have more experience with this stuff.
I bought contacts and couldn't get them to work; just couldn't wear them at all.
I had the lip biopsy and it confirmed my diagnosis. All my blood work was negative. I have had no negative after effects from the biopsy.
I had lip biopsy and my neuro refers to a plastic surgeoun. I felt no pain during or after and took no painkillers. I was worried too but no nerve damage here. Go to a plastic surgeoun that regularly performs this procedure
"While your situation is different from mine, I do want to throw this out there."

"What is your course of action with versus without the lip biopsy? The main reason why I didn't do it was because the doctor's treatment plan was the same either way. (Mine wasn't serious enough to go on steroids and other more serious medications). Even though the lip biopsy is a pretty small risk, I needed some motivation to do it that wasn't there."

"In another regard, I am still undiagnosed. You could get that closure if you want a label on your illness. Moreover, you could ""add a data point"" to the scientific literature on this awful disease."

I wish you the very best!
"I actually just had a lip biopsy 2 days ago and I can say I have all the feeling back in my lip. Even my stitches have stayed in. My doctor told me they would fall out within the first 8 hours. I’m a little sore, which is normal."

I had a Otolaryngologist perform my lip biopsy and I’d recommend you find a competent doctor your feel comfortable with before you move forward with the biopsy.

"The procedure itself was pretty simple, the only pain I experienced was from the needle to numb the lip. It was just stinging and it lasted only a few seconds."
I have heard from people here that going to a plastic surgeon to do it can make a world of difference. I have not been through it and share your hesitation but I'm only at the beginning of this ride and can't say what I may think or feel if it all came back negative.
I had the lip biopsy at my rheumatologist suggestion as my blood tests did not show sjogrens but she was pretty certain I had it. She sent me to an ENT in their practice who had performed quite a few of the biopsies. I came out with a pretty nasty incision and do have permanent nerve damage.  I did get a confirmed diagnosis.
"I had the biopsy as my bloodwork was negative. Even if treatment is same, I wanted to know. Had mine done by ENT. Pain afterwards but was manageable and no lasting problems. Really glad I did it."
Sleepiness is an understatement for me. Battling extreme fatigue daily but hope for the future!
I am undiagnosed but recently have figured out it is what I have. I have almost all the symptoms. Negative blood test except for slightly elevated liver function.  I don’t want to do the lip biopsy since I have no insurance. My PCP is direct pay.

I am a bit frustrated by this. I use xiidra but only get first box free and unless I have insurance they are $250. My eye doctor told me there is no way around either restasis or xiidra.
"I read you should get lip biopsy only during a flare, otherwise it will be negative. I have post nasal drip and bad mouth since few days, so temporarily do not have dry mouth. So should I get the lip biopsy later?"
My doctor won't treat me without lip biopsy. He doesn't believe I have it.
Did you get the report of biopsy yet?
Ohh God. Permanent nerve damage means there is pain all the time? What symptoms did you have that suggested Sjogrens
I've never heard that. I just went to the doctor (a plastic surgeon) and had it done after my neurologist ordered it.

"You may not think you have a dry mouth (for you), but the saliva glands show changes that they are looking for. Is the appointment soon? I'd ask the doctor that would be performing the biopsy about that."
"For what it's worth, I had a doctor that said the same thing. I changed doctors (to actually a much better doctor) and he said that Plaquenil is not that serious of a drug and that I could try it if I wanted to either way. It's something to consider if that's your only reason for doing it."

"EDIT: Of course, I'm not talking about a more intense medical treatment, just my own experiences."
"Not yet, I’m hoping by next week. I was told 7-10 days."

"I also have pretty much negative bloodwork, only  a borderline positive ANA 1:80 IFA Speckled. I am hoping this will shed some light."
"No pain, but numbness in my lip.  I have a little trouble eating sometimes  food falls out of my mouth if I’m not careful lol."
I read plaquenil can cause blindness and you need eye monitoring. Aren't you scared of that? Do you have fatigue and palpitations?
What are your symptoms? Do you have bad fatigue?
"I actually decided not to start it yet. At this point, I am going to back off since I am not a medical expert."
"I have a lot of symptoms, but yes I have bad fatigue most days. Sometimes it feels like my body has lead weights on and it’s hard to move. My main issues are dysautonomia (Orthostatic hypotension),  Gastroparesis and GERD, chronic constipation, numbness and tingling in my extremities and terrible dryness. My eyes, mouth, skin and vagina are very dry."

Most recently my liver enzymes have been elevated for no apparent reason. Through my research I found that the liver can be a common non-exocrine target in Sjogrens.
I have orthostatic symptoms too. My heart rate goes up on standing. I have to take heart rate lowering medication.
If you haven’t already I’d recommend going to Sjogrens.org. https://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens/symptoms

Here you can find all the possible symptoms it can cause. This might help you make a decision if having a biopsy is worth it to you. Negative bloodwork doesn’t rule out the disease.
I am afraid that even biopsy may come negative. That's why hesitating. But will most likely get it done.
"I wanted to come back and update you, my biopsy results came in and they were positive. I had >=1 Focal Lymphocytic Sialadenitis. I am going to be following up with my Rheuma to see if he will finally diagnose me and if he won’t I’m moving on to another doctor."
"Just know that negative bloodwork doesn’t mean that you don’t have it. It just means to need to work much harder to get a doctor to take you seriously. Especially if you are young, at least that has been my experience so far."
"Ohh, thanks for the update. I thgought I'd skip as my doc convinced I dont have it and thinks I have fibromyalgia/cfs. Also was afraid of nerve damage from biopsy. Now planning to get it done. And I have to mention this, although my ANA was positive on immunoflorescence (1:320), I got line immunoassay done for various antibodies, and they all came negative. So my doc is convinced i dont have it. Do u have any bladder issues?"
I want to tack on that she needs to take care of her mental health too. A diagnosis like Sjogrens isn’t just a physical disease. It takes a mental toll too. Try to see if she can get into therapy to start working on ways to manage the depression that can come with such a debilitating diagnosis.
What specific symptoms is she feeling?
Oh my. Sounds like she’s hurting. A hot shower and heating pads help me. I hope you she can find relief that is healthy for her.
"Hey op, some things that have helped me: autoimmune protocol diet, meditation, short walks, swimming, yoga, magnesium baths, golden milk (made with turmeric). I know excercise seems crazy right now but short walks have helped me climb out of flares, start with very short ones - even just two minutes if that's all she can tolerate. Lots of water and herbal tea, bone broth. Lots of fluids will help. Definitely get her in and see if they can adjust anything she's on, I hope she gets some relief soon!"
Low dose naltrexone is helping my pain levels go down and it’s only been a week. It’s an immune modulator but less toxic and expensive than other drugs- I think it’s worth a try. I noticed a change after 1st dose
Sjogrens Foundation has support groups and contacts. Maybe beneficial for.you and/or your mom.
Can she get seen soon? Sounds like she needs pain relief.
"This is the first thing my rheumy told me. To take care of your mental health and learn stress reducing strategies. Depression, anxiety, stress all cause flares."
Can you give me more info on the autoimmune protocol diet? I've never heard of this. I have been eating gluten free and have been feeling alot better.
She wants to thank you all for your help. She was wondering what type of meds anyone takes that tends to help
She has seen a dr. But doesn’t take pain pills because she is in recovery.
"Hey, Assiramama, just a quick heads-up:"
"**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**."
Have a nice day!

There's an active sub here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/
Prednisone?
Go away snob bot.
"Two years ago I had a dry flare in my eyes that resulted in three corneal ulcers, two in one eye and one in the other. My ExpressCare visit fast-tracked me into an ophthalmologist. I now have a regimen that includes restasis, OTC artificial tears, ointment, and heat packs. I also am to wash my lids x1 daily with baby shampoo. My eyes have healed, but I pay attention if they begin to burn or hurt. I understand. May you find relief soon."
I have 7 different OTC drops and gels in addition to restasis. Nothing works. I have 1 punctal plug in my left eye and getting the right eye plugged tomorrow.  The right eye plug had to be ordered because the original one was too big. I've been suffering for 3 years with my eyes; it was so bad i could pull stringy mucus off my lids. I have headaches so bad for eye pain... damn

I use ponaris for my sinus ulcers due to dryness. M nose constantly runs due to the tears draining from my eyes into my sinuses.

"One trick I use when my eyes are really suffering, I sniff black pepper to sneeze and make my eyes tear up. It offers soooo much relief."


"Listen, this dry eye, sinus, waking up at 3am because  my tongue is stuck to the roof of my mouth...the aches and pains...it can only be treated, not cured so we must find treatments that work for us."

"Buy a humidifier, try the OTC drops, mouthwashes and sinus gels and take care..."

-Your friend in the struggle-

Edit: words
I've had great success with salagen/pilocarpine. It's a pill I take 4 times a day.

"For about 2-3 hours, each dose, it stimulates my lacrimal glands. I have tears and saliva! It causes me to lightly perspire, but I can deal with it because it's the first real relief I've had in months."
My eyes were so dry the eye doctors I visited said they had never seen someone that had eyes that were as dry as mine. I had to put gel drops sometimes four times per hour and even that wasn’t enough.

"I suffered with those for over five years until I finally got punctal plugs. I’ve got four of those in my eyes now and I don’t have to even use gel drops anymore. My eyes are still sensitive and they leak all the time and it looks like I’m crying, but I’d still prefer this over the eyes so dry it was hard to keep my eyes open."

"Also, a humidifier is a must."
"Yes, I went from being in pain all the time and not wanting to get out of bed, not being able to function sometimes to being mostly asymptomatic. A few years ago I was wondering if I would ever work again, just ordered my cap and grown for my masters degree graduation. It does get better, you just have to find the treatments that are right for you."
"My ophthamogist recommend trying high doses of Omega 3's before he would put me on any of the prescription eye drops. I was extremely skeptical and thought it wouldn't do anything, but it made my eyes a million times better. I take 2 capsules in the morning and one around dinner time, and some days I don't need to use any drops at all!"
"I think we ALL feel your pain! As an Optician with Sjögren’s, I’ve had access to the latest and “greatest” in the symptomatic treatment of extreme dryness that comes along with Sjögren’s. After all the drops, etc., I’ve found that Punctal Plugs have been the greatest help thus far- along with an Over The Counter Spray called OcuSoft- HypoChlor or Retaine. HypoChlor is typically used for Blepharitis, but the Optometrist I used to work for told me to spray with eyes shut, AND once or twice with eyes open, then close my eyes for a couple of minutes. This definitely helped temporarily. I haven’t tried the Retaine myself- but have heard that it does wonders and restores nutrients and antioxidants our eyes loose due to being so dry. Worth a shot!!"
I had a horrible time with my symptoms back in my 20's but after eliminating things in my diet that caused inflammation and seeing a shrink to help reduce my non-stop anxiety (spent life always about 1 second away from adrenaline boost and fight or flight response and my breaths in and out was way too rapid all the time).

The food part took some trial and error since gluten and sugar caused the worst effects but while not seeing carbs as sugar (which it obviously totally is) I just changed a lot of my bread and such into the gluten free versions which contained oodles of corn/maize/potato/rice starch which dried out my system in a whole different way. I only eat buckwheat crackers these days they don't dry me out.

"I would suspect that the mental health bit was what made the biggest change, also how I found out about the 'ACE' score system and how childhood traumas cause long term health problems. There is a good TED talk with Nadine Burke Harris explaining it if you want to know more; [How Childhood Trauma Affects Health Across A Lifetime](https://www.ted.com/talks/nadine_burke_harris_how_childhood_trauma_affects_health_across_a_lifetime)"

"I use nighttime ointment every night, plus a humidifier, and that helps enormously. Heat packs for your eyes may also help, and ask your doctor about Xiidra or Restasis. Some people get relief, some don't. OTC eyedrops, gel or liquid, do not help me at all."

"My eyes are so dry that my eyelids used to stick to my corneas at night and cause tears (as in rips, not the liquid kind) when I moved my eyes in REM sleep. The ointment is fantastic - just make sure to put it in immediately before going to bed, and keep your eyes closed. I also have scleral contact lenses that bathe my eyes in saline all day. Expensive, but worth every penny. My eyes don't hurt at all when they're in, though I can feel the rigid contact getting dry when I blink. Still, no pain is huge."

Good luck! Relief is out there. You just have to keep trying things to figure out what works best for you.
I tried lacrisert. They kind of seemed to help a bit but would kind of expand in my eye to actually then become bothersome.   Wasn't really for me.

A lot of what I do has already been mentioned.  I'll add some stuff...

I use the Systane nighttime pm ointment at night

I find that when allergies are bad my eyes get worse (even drier) so I try to keep my allergies in check with oral medication when necessary and they also make prescription allergy drops and other ones like zaditor eye drops.  Just mentioning in case this could be a contributing factor for you too.  Took me a while to realize this.  But be careful because I think many allergy meds can make eyes drier and not all kinds are good for everyone so ask your Dr. first.

Extra Hydration (drinking Powerade) etc helps me.  I've also tried specific vitamin blends for dry eyes.

"I had a corneal abrasion that had problems healing. Surprisingly, I liked the feel of the bandage contact and have asked to try wearing one when eye pain acts up.  It seems to help but I think I have strange nodules or something inside upper eye lid."

"I also wear blue blocking type glasses (I got on amazon- they're like orange/yellow color and I can wear over my regular glasses). I put them on first thing in the a.m. (light seems to bother my eyes in the a.m.) and I also wear before going to bed while on the phone, etc. My eyes seem very sensitive to light and these seem to help for screen time."

"My eye pain does come and go... never great but some days are better and not all that bad.  I'm still working on figuring out triggers (light, allergens, dehydration, lack of sleep, etc)"
"I was diagnosed about 5 years ago and while it never fully goes away, it does ebb and flow. It can be triggered by anything - weather, stress, a new makeup product that irritates my eyes, a windy day, etc. There are some products that can help - and there are already a lot of good recs on this thread. I haven't tried Lacrisert, though. Hang in there."
This may sound weird but I've read that certain things stimulate the glands. The other day I had an atomic fireball and my eyes and nose starting running down my face. I think lemons are supposed to help too. And other things that are sour! Horseradish too.
"I feel your pain. OP - I have had flare up with worsening dry eyes.  No solid ideas as to why.  Strange thing happened last week.  After yet another bout of blepharitis, I finished the steroid drops and 3 days later I wake up with red, swollen, and get this...watery eyes.  WTF?  I haven’t shed a tear in 25 years.   Couldn’t cry after my dad or my dog died.  It hurts so bad to cry and not shed tears.  Like the dry heaves.  I couldn’t get eye doc appointment until today, so I spent 4 days with literally continuous tears.  I couldn’t read my cellphone because of the tears falling on the phone. I didn’t even have to use gel at night.  Tears were running down my cheek.  If you’d seen me you’d have thought I had some psychotic break.  As fucked up as it sounds, I almost didn’t want it to stop.  But I was worried it was pink eye or something and didn’t want to expose anyone to it.  Doc puts me back on steroid drops again saying it’s allergic conjunctivitis that, ironically, was triggered by the drops he prescribed the last time, that I’m on again.  I’ve lived in an allergy hell hole for over 25 years and not one drop of tears until now, so I’m not really buying his theory.  But one thing is certain, my tear ducts aren’t as totally destroyed as I was led to believe they were and I think that is significant.  But what to do with that knowledge?  Now, if I could only figure this out, water it down some, and bottle it we’d all be free of this dry eye monster."
"I've tried a number of different drops, and find that vials of Hypromellose work well, but only for 10ish minutes."

"Do you have any mouthwash recommendations? I tried that Therabreath in the green bottle that has enzymes. It has rave reviews, but I found it horrible. It stung my mouth and tasted like vomit. But maybe I got a bad batch?"
"Have you tried Salagen or Evoxac? Both are saliva production meds that have generic versions. They are very helpful for getting a good night's sleep. For me, the Evoxac also has a bonus side effect of tear production. Something you might want to ask your doctor or dentist about if you haven't tried them yet."
That's great to hear! Ive tried pilocarpine and it works amazingly...on every part of my body except the eyes! I would like to try evoxac but that isng available in my country.
"I tried this too. I have bad dry eyes but my mouth is fine. First day I tried this, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like I was drowning... there was so much saliva in my mouth, throat, all over my bed, etc.  lol.  I cut down on the dose... I really can feel the extra moisture in my eyes but I stopped taking because it was making me dizzy/faint."
Thanks for sharing your experience with plugs. Its something to keep in mind
"Thank you for mentioning this. I’m currently a college student and fear I may have sjögren’s and I’ve been a wreck with horrible anxiety and thoughts of suicide. This makes me feel better knowing that even if I am diagnosed, my life is not over!"
"I actually bought some omega 3 capsules but gave up because of the rancid fish burps, and I didn't notice much of a difference. I will definitely give your regimen a try. Thanks!"
"Good to hear that cyclosporine can work. I asked my GP and optometrist about it, and neither of them had ever heard of such a thing. I just have to get in with an ophthalmologist now!"
"Can I ask what kind of ointment you use? I just got some Simple eye ointment to try, but it's too thick to actually come out of the tube, or disperse across my eye. I've tried warming the tube up but still no luck."
"I have had more success with Xiidra than anything else. It's $80 a month, but I generally only use it once a day, and can also get more than one day's dose from each little vial. My eye doctor says it's unhygenic, but you save where you can."

&#x200B;

Warm to the warmest you can stand moist compresses have also been very helpful.
"I know what you mean about the crying. It feels so weird. A little while ago I got really upset and was finally able to cry tears...and it felt amazing. I couldn't even keep on crying, I was so distracted by the bliss."
I use the biotene or Colgate mouthwash for dry mouth. They work ok. Makes everything taste nasty though.
Your life is *definitely* not over! So many treatment options now and great support on the internet. I'm sure you'll find the right mix. PM me anytime. I'd also be glad to share my regimen with you.
"Not sure where you are located, but I use Webber Naturals Omega 3 capsules that I get at Costco. I have never had a fishy taste with them."
"Systane, Genteal and Rephresh make eye gels / ointments."
"Much appreciated. I’m seeing an ENT in two weeks to take a look at my mouth as I’ve been complaining that it was dry. Hopefully I get some answers, because it’s driving me crazy!"
No!! You are your best advocate. Some might frown upon it but I wouldn't go to a doctor who wasn't open to it. They should be working hard at doing everything they can to help you.
"i also did this when things got serious for me. some dr's made me feel stupid but they were bad dr's. for an autoimmune disease ALOT is going on... yes, do it!"
"When I was first diagnosed I started bringing a binder that had a copy of every lab test, every MRI, every CT, every prescription, and my personal notes from every visit, all color coded and filed chronologically.  My doctor didn't bat an eye, so if my level of crazy was ok I think bringing in a list of issues is perfectly fine.  You have to advocate for yourself.  The best rheumatologist I've seen so far is also the one that I have to remind of my case history every single time, they just simply see to many people so you have to actually ask for their help with your problems."
"hell no! bring the list, and remember that the doc is being payed to assist you, if he/she doesn't like it... they are not good at what they do."
"I keep my similar list in Notes on my iPhone I can share with him.  I also keep a running list of questions that pop into my forgetful head from time to time so I will remember to ask him.  I print out labs from his portal, highlight what is different from quarter to quarter so as maximize my time  spent with him.  He in turn gives me “homework”  assignments like reading research papers and study results for potential changes in medications so I can weigh risk vs reward.   You have to be involved in your care and you seem to be well organized.  Good for you.   The “Marcus Welty” days of the kind old gray haired doc in a white lab coat who spent a crazy amount of time helping you solve all your problems only exists on MeTV."
"I do it all the time, and I know they appreciate it. Sometimes I just hand my PCP the list, because she can read faster than I can talk. I also bring all test results from other doctors that I've seen since my last visit. I want all of them to know what the others are doing. It can only help me in the long run."
"I have a Vicks Warm Moisture Humidifier in my bedroom and a Honeywell Mistmate Ultrasonic Humidifier in my living room. I've noticed keeping the humidity in my home between 50 and 60 helps with my dry nose, eyes, and skin. It hasnt helped me with dry mouth problems, though."
"I made one out of a plastic bin, a PC fan and a pond fogger. Its controlled by a humidistat. Cost maybe $100 max (including messing up one bin and a few other false starts)."

I did this after repeatedly buying cheap ($35) and more expensive (~$100) humidifiers and having them break after 6-9 months.

"Its easy to clean, turns off at the right humidity, or if the water is too low, lasts all night (actually a couple of nights), and every part of it, from the disc in the ultrasonic emitter, to the PC fan, to the humidity controller is replaceable."

"This is a video from the place where I got the pond fogger and the inspiration. There are lots of other youtube videos with other ideas and design mods too (mine has a chimney, which keeps water drops from coming out)."

https://youtu.be/PHpCo_ZFgfE

"I live on an area where a humidifier is only needed in the cooler months, so I get cheap ones every year. I’ve never been good at upkeep with them, so it’s easier for me to just start fresh every winter."

"They help my skin, eyes and nose. Like another poster mentioned, they have not helped the dry Sahara of my mouth and throat."
I just recently bought the cheapest warm mist vaporizer at walgreens it was like $16. I actually bought because my dogs skin was so dry during the winter and i'd tried everything else and he was just itchy. I was suprised that helped with my dry nose though which in turn helped my dry mouth and throat as when my nose was dry i couldnt breathe through it and then would sleep with my mouth open contributing with to the dry mouth and throat. reasons i got a warm mist vaporizer over a cool mist humidifier 1) cheaper by at least $10 2) the cool mist humidifiers can grow mold and break easily if your not careful about what water you use and i know my lazy ass wouldn't clean it as much as necessary. the down side to the warm mist is it leaves condensation on the outside walls and widows which could contribute to mold growth. In any case its been helpful for me this winter.
"Thank you all for your input and recommendations! Sorry it has taken me so long to reply, I've just been super busy. I'll definitely be looking into everything you all said. Thanks again!"
In your humidifiers that broke: did you use tap water or distilled?
"Both, whatever the instructions stated. Usually filtered tap water."
I was asking because I went through about 3 humidifiers when I was using tap water in them. I read somewhere that the minerals and calcium in tap water causes the parts on the inside to calcify (the one you can't get to). I never read the directions prior to that but it does call for distilled and I guess that makes sense because I've had good luck with them since I've only used distilled!
"The great thing about my pond fogger is it says you *shouldn't* use filtered or distilled water. Plus the ceramic disc is rated for 5000 hours, and is replaceable. Its also teflon coated so any crap that builds up on it can just be wiped off."

"I honestly think that, besides one or two that ran out of water and didn't have auto-shutoff, the buildup of biofilm, not minerals is what got them (with all the nooks and crannies I couldn't get them totally clean, vinegar might have killed the bacteria but it couldn't wash them all out once they're dead). I'm going to experiment with adding UV sterilization to my humidifier at some point. I've read it can reduce or eliminate the formation of biofilm."
"Plaquenil (Hydroxychloroquine) was actually developed as an anti malaria product and is still used for that today. While using it to treat malaria it was discovered it also worked on rheumatic pain. Afaik the scientists haven't discovered why it works, only that it does."

"The only serious side effect I know of (and only few experience this) is that it can damage your eye sight permanently. For this reason you ought to be checked every 6 month or so by an opthamologist, so you can catch any damage before it gets too bad. To me it was a life saver. My joints, feet and hands hurt so much that I couldn't do a thing. I couldn't even button my baby's clothes or open his bottle. 14 days after the first pill the pain was bearable and I've taken it ever since without any side effects at all."
"I’ve been on it for 2 years. With me, I’m very very fair to begin with, maybe it’s the fibromyalgia, but this med certainly made it worse. Extreme sun sensitivity. Any time spent in day light, even with clothes on, makes my skin feel like it’s on fire. I’ve gotten sunburned through jeans. This is all with layers of sunscreen already. Be careful in the sun."
"Bless you! I am an optimist and have learned to like full moons, and evening and early morning. I have plans for a night garden. It is not the same as oiling up and floating but it is something new."
I have a few autoimmune disorders and each has taken some of my identity. But in a sink or swim frame of mind I keep moving.
I wish you optimistic hope or hopeful optimism.
I pray for better medicine.
I have been taking this for a year now. The Sjogrens gave me a lot of joint pain. Macular degeneration is the only risk I am worried about as my Mother has age related macular degeneration. A good eye doctor is necessary but
I had that.
Sunlight is already a worry for me. But did you know you can treat your clothes to help block uv. There are coverups that do a good job.
I was told to avoid prolong exposure to sunlight be cause I break out in a rash.
This is a good drug and has dampened my pain quite a bit.
"My husband takes it for lupus, so I was already familiar with it when I got diagnosed and offered it. He's been on it for 6 years and is happy with it. Long term, he sees an eye doctor to check for retinal toxicity. He had nausea beginning it, so I expected that. It was a rough two weeks after I started. That settled down, and I'm experiencing no side effects now. No therapeutic benefit yet. It hasn't been very long."
"It's been great for me. I have had virtually no joint pain since taking this drug, and I have not noticed any major side effects. As the other posters suggested, be sure to get your eyes checked on a regular basis. My eye doctor did tell me that it's very rare to experience the damage/blindness, but better safe than sorry."
This drug was effective for pain relief but did take several months o taking it for it to work.  I had violent unpredictable diarrhea on it and had to stop taking it.
"I've been on it, 200mg daily, for almost 18 months now. My joint pain was unbearable and although the plaquenil took 6 months to give me pain relief.....it is worth it. I already take Cymbalta (120mg daily) for my fibro, and the combo with Plaquenil is fine."
"My rheumy advised there is little concern on such low dosage as mine for damage to my eyes. That being said,  my ophthalmologist checks my eyes for damage yearly."

"I had terriblle hives for a few weeks in the beginning. That subsided. I still have terrible photosensitivity, so i have to be careful of being in sun. But for me it's worth it as it manages my pain."
Good luck
"As far as I'm concerned, any doctor asking you to take a drug that's dangerous (toxic to eyes) to treat sjogren's is essentially saying ""I don't believe you"". [Plaquenil is no better at treating sjogren's than placebo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5427554/). It was always off-label, anyway. To me the risks outweigh the potential benefits. The doctor tells you that you won't see benefit for up to six months. Who can properly compare pain six months ago to now? There was a shortage once and I couldn't get plaquenil for two months. I was worried at first, but felt no increase in any symptoms without it. I realized then that I was spending money on a sham."
"Plaquenil has helped me tremendously, it keeps my muscles from feeling like they are on fire! My shoulders were hot to the touch! I didn't know it messed with your eyesight. My eyesight is off today, and I'm short of breath. I need some damn Prednisone and my doctor said no."
Did you hear that 20% of fibromyalgia patients actually have small fiber neuropathy? I bet the percentage among Sjogren's patients is a lot higher.
What the hell. I didn't know this. 😢😢
"Thank you, this does however make me a little sad. One of my favorite things to do in the summer is lay out in the sun and float in the pool. My husband and I go to the Caribbean every year and laying out is one of my favorite ways to relax. I know tanning is so bad for everyone but it’s my one vice in life."
That article you linked -if you read it the study found that it was effective for pain “The efficacy of HCQ in treating pain associated with pSS was superior to that of the placebo.” It has long been proven to help with [joint pain in closely related arthritic diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7847432/) and that is why it is one of the first line medications for rheumatic disorders. The point of the study you linked was that it doesn’t treat dry mouth/eyes. I’m sorry it didn’t help you and that you feel your doctor doesn’t believe you- but even though physicians may prescribe things that may be harmful in large doses (like Tylenol’s effect on the liver) it is still better to get information from skilled professionals than buying snake oil off the Internet.
Is there a test for that? Thank you.
I layed on the beach for years on plaquinil in San Diego for 5 years.... Didn't change anything for me
"The article you link is about rheumatoid arthritis. My discussion was specific to sjogren's primary. Dry eyes and mouth have never been my primary symptoms. It made zero difference on my pain, which is unrelated to rheumatoid arthritis in any way. There's no valid evidence of statistically significant improvement in patients with primary sjogren's."
"Testing hasn't progressed very far. Neurology needs to get their shit together and find that antibodies for MS and Sjogren's, etc. and small-fiber neuropathy. Right now you can get a couple of biopsies where they measure the intraepidermal nerve fibers per millimeter between samples taken from your mid-body and further away down to your lower calf. They compare the two samples; at the epidermal level there be more sparse in nerves the further from mid-body when small-fiber neuropathy is present. I think it's an in-office biopsy situation."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086960/

"Except the article you linked! “The results show that the efficacy of HCQ treatment (pooled proportion = 48.9%; 95% CI = 38.7–59.1%) for SS pain was higher than placebo treatment (pooled proportion = 35.8%; 95% CI = 23.5–49.0%; Table 4 and Figs. 6 and ​and7)” That IS evidence of a statistically significant improvement in pain in an article that YOU provided! It obviously didn’t work for you, and that sucks and I’m sorry that you’re having to suffer through this terrible disease but your overall statement is false and you provided the exact study that proves it. Not every treatment is going to work for everyone and it makes sense for doctors to try established medicines before resorting to more drastic treatment- I’m not sure what alternative you would have OP seek or why you felt the need to sow distrust between them and their healthcare provider based on your anecdotal experience."
"Thank you, because I’m pretty sure I have this. What is the treatment?"
"Click the link, there's a pretty thorough discussion of current options."
Thank you
Tonsil stones? Salivary Gland Stones? If it's one of these there are rinses and massages.

"Incidentally, I have Sjogren's AND have had a malignant submandibular gland tumor, so pm me any time, though it looks like you're in the clear, thankfully."

"Over the course of a few years I changed my diet and that helped relieve the inflammation. The idea is with something like the Autoimmune Protocal (AIP) you would be able to stop your immune system from attacking your own body. I'm virtually pain free, just have to watch the stress."
What main diet changes did you do? Gluten free?
"Yes, being gluten free takes care of about 90% of my pain, then avoiding nightshades, soy, oatmeal, coffee covers the rest. I try to get enough rest, meditate, exercise. I went from not being able to get out of bed to now full time work and grad school, feeling great."
"I'd suggest slowing down a bit. Focus on one thing at a time. So, you're doing plaquinil - stick with that for a couple of months and see how it goes, then change your diet. And only change one thing in your diet at a time."

"I know you want to just fix everything and feel better (been there, omg), but you really don't know what's helping when you jump into everything at once."

Its a process - we have to learn how to manage the disease. Not everything helps everyone. You gotta work through things methodically and figure out what works for you. It takes time.

"Side note: unless you're sure caffeine is making your symptoms worse, don't worry about cutting it out right now. You're dealing with so much else, its okay to lean on something like a little coffee habit to make it easier. Once you figure some other stuff out, you can try again."
I've just read both of your responses and feel like I'm going to cry. What a relief to read that I don't have to find all of the solutions right now. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I have Sjogren's and that has been an emotional rollercoaster.

"I have felt the intense need to try to cure myself as quickly as possible. Yes, I know there is no cure... really just trying to cure the symptoms as quickly as possible."

"I can actually deal with the dry mouth and eyes pretty well but the fatigue, mental fog, poor concentration, short term memory something, and just poor sleep are the symptoms that are troubling, scary and upsetting."

Thank you for your advise on taking it slowly and only changing one thing in my diet at a time. That makes sense. How am I going to know what does or doesn't trigger me if I just exclude and not investigate.

I've looked for support groups. There is one in my area and I hope to connect with folks soon.

love and stuff!

"I’d agree about trying one component at a time. This way you can figure out what works and what doesn’t work. That’s actually the whole philosophy behind the autoimmune protocol diet. You have the illumination phase, but then you’re supposed to re-introduce one thing at a time so that you can figure out what your having a reaction to."

"I’m envious that you’re able to do the Plaquenil. It gave me wicked migraines so I had to give it up. I have found that mild exercise helps. I also have found that taking fish oil helps with inflammation.  I also suffer from extreme environmental allergies so I have found that getting that under control has kept some of the flareups from getting worse. Probiotics are a must, btw. They’ll really help straighten out your gut flora so you get more nutrients out of what foods you do eat."

The most important thing is to pace yourself and don’t be hard on yourself when you’re having bad days. It’s really tough to compare yourself where you are right now to where you were say five or 10 years ago as far as expectations of what you can and cannot do. I think that the emotional factor has a bigger toll on us than most rheumatologists will admit to. I was diagnosed a year ago and I’m just starting to learn to allow myself to have days where I just can’t accomplish anything close to what I used to be able to.

"Everyone is different so by all means consider the things that we’re all sharing with you, but in the end it’s your journey and what works for us may not necessarily work for you and vice versa. Wishing you the best!"
"I have an unspecified autoimmune disease; suspected Sjogrens. Just throwing this out there, you can take it as seriously as you want:"

"When my disease is bad, a general lifestyle thing that helps me significantly with the pain is watching my blood sugar spikes. I don't mean necessarily checking your blood sugar with an instrument, just using common sense. I eat small meals, avoid processed sugar, etc."

"I see you talked about sugar in your post. For me, this is a big one. For me, having a super fine tuned diet doesn't do anything. i.e. there is no magic diet that makes the disease go away. But big picture stuff does help. The mistakes I made at the beginning was being too focused on the little picture. For most people with autoimmune diseases, it is not caused by diet. Bigger picture is far more important than little picture."

Another thing that has realllllllllly helped me is regular exercise. It is almost solely the reason why I function.

"Edit: One reason why I mention the big picture is that for most of us, there is significant amounts of denial; there are books that tell us it is caused by diet. They are mostly to exploit our desperation, spend way too much of our time obsessing on ingredients, etc."

"I do, however, recommend being sure it is not caused by diet (as sometimes it definitely is). I did an elimination diet for a couple months just to be totally sure. When it didn't do anything, I knew it wasn't caused by diet. Once you reach this stage, it is more important to accept it and focus on the bigger things: regular sleep schedule, regular intake of vitamins, regular hydration, regular exercise, etc. than worry about if there are traces of gluten in something."
"Diet: Most of the diet changes that people say help them were unacceptable changes for me. I tried the lowfodmap diet for IBS and it did absolutely nothing for me (that is, essentially, keto and raw and gluten free all rolled up into one and without any flavor as onions, most fruit, and garlic are not allowed!). People who find that it works for them probably also have a touch of IBS or coeliac. If you aren't coeliac, gluten free won't help much."

"Recently, though, in an effort to slim down a bit and in support of my daughter (type 1 diabetic), we decided to try intermittent fasting. WOAH. Show stopper for me. I only eat between 10 am and 6 pm. I try to make sure I get enough fruit and veg, watch my meat intake a bit, go for whole grains where I can. I rarely eat dairy and hardly ever bread, but I still eat wheat, just not in bread. I have been doing it for a month, and, although I haven't lost weight, I feel like a totally different person. I sleep better, I have more energy, I'm more alert. I feel like I'm in remission, honestly."

"Personally, I won't do any diet without science behind it. IF has numerous studies backing up a lot of its anti-inflammatory effects. FODMAP has science, but not surrounding sjogren's, only IBS, which I was assuming I probably had. Gluten free is only supported in coeliac, and I had me tested for that. :)"

"Fatigue: I was afraid I would have to quit working it was so bad. If it gets bad, talk to your rheumy about a stimulant. Vyvanse has saved my life. I don't feel like I'm falling asleep all the time, and I can drive without feeling like I'm just going to pass out going 85 on i-10. Also, I still use caffeine."

"Plaquenil: Never did anything for me. A study came out a few years ago indicating that there was no difference in patients on and/or off of it, so I decided the potential for toxicity outweighed the benefits, of which there were none for me. Plus, it made my hair thin, and I am still not happy about that. Ugh."

"It's new, but you've been dealing for a long time. You'll get it all. Take care of you."
Female/38 dx 4 years ago

"I think the diet you do is going to depend on your body. After experimenting for 5 years, I found that gf, mostly df, no soy, coffee or oatmeal, limited nightshades, sugar and caffeine is what works for me. I take fish oil, sea buckthorn (for dryness) a one a day vitamin, Vit D and levothytroxine (sp?) for thyroid. You may want to get your thyroid checked. Epsom baths, meditation, yoga, and walking all keep my body moving and the stress down."

"I found that the fatigue goes away as you get your diet under control and exercise a little bit. I slept terrible prior to that, and as I started taking care of myself I could exercise more and sleep better and my pain started to abate and it all evened out eventually."

"Keeping the stress down is a big deal, that will help reduce your inflammation. I find that if I do everything ""right"" I can still feel lousy when I get stressed out."
I wanted to thank everyone who responded. It's so helpful to have feedback from others going through the same thing. I'm thankful for your generosity in responding to me with what you've gone through and sharing your stories.
"Thanks to everyone in this thread for their responses. My mom was diagnosed recently and I'm trying to do some research to help her. Her symptoms are somewhat mild besides issues with her tear ducts and salivary glands but being a loving daughter has me really worried for her. I appreciate all the advice in this thread. And support to you, OP. Keep giving yourself the best care!"
"My doctor said gluten-free diet is good, but didn’t say much more than that. Traditional doctors do not seem to know too much about how what you eat affects you, especially when you have autoimmune disorders."

"I have been gluten free for five years and dairy free for three years. If I ate those, I couldn’t probably even get up from bed."

"I was vegan for three years, but only few months ago started to eat organic meat. I read about this diet called AIP and you can’t do it as a vegan so I had to give that up, it was hard at first."

"Eating good, quality organic meats is the thing. Going vegan can be good for someone, but after being vegan, I don’t think it’s the only good diet to have. Except for avoiding dairy, which for some people like me causes more pains."

"Avoiding coffee is also a good choice, because with sjögren’s we usually have extremely sensitive stomachs and coffee can really upset that. Also sugar can cause stomach upsets, especially white sugar!"

"I have replaced my morning coffees with matcha latte, I highly recommend that if you feel like needing some extra boost in the morning."

"Since sjögren’s involves a lot of gut problems, finding the right probiotic is crucial. Atleast for me. Even just few days of not eating probiotics I start feeling much worse."

"About supplements, I give you a list of what I eat everyday:"

#NAME?
#NAME?

"Sometimes I eat more stuff, but these are the solid part of my everyday supplementation."

"Unfortunately I don’t have any tips for fighting fatigue because it’s one of my biggest obstacles also. Sleeping and resting a lot are good, it’s important to learn to listen to our bodies when it signals us that now is time to rest. Sometimes just walking to the grocery store is so rough I need to rest for couple of hours after that. If I don’t, then my fatigue gets even worse. So finding your own unique balance of what’s too much and what’s okay to do is important."
"So the thing about autoimmunity is that every person gets to be special.  We all react differently to different things, so food-wise you might find that some things that worked for some people might not work for others.  In that vein, you might react to sugar, wheat, gluten, nightshade, dairy, eggs, or meat, or any other number of factors.  But the thing with food is that its incredibly difficult to tell if you've had a difference in how you feel unless you are used to figuring out how your reaction to your common triggers are.  So, for example, if you eliminate dairy at the beginning of the summer and then proceed to spend way too much time in the sun without sunscreen or in the heat (UV and heat exposure are very common autoimmune triggers) then that's not really a good test of if the lack of dairy is effecting you or not."

"So if you know for sure that any foods are likely to trigger issues (for example, I was on a ketogenic very low carb diet before my diagnosis because I tried it for weight loss and found that I had way more energy and less brain fog on it) then I'd stick to that, but otherwise I'd spend the next six months working on identifying your triggers (environmental and emotional) and letting your body get used to the Plaquenil.  Then maybe start experimenting.  I know it seems right now like you need to *do* something, but I promise you that processing this information and deciding what things in your life need to change as a result is going to take a lot more of your emotional energy than you'd expect."

"The best advice for you I can possibly give is to find a therapist, and if you haven't already research [Spoon Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory).  When I went to the doctor for my diagnosis I thought I was just going to have to take some vitamins or maybe go on some medication or something.  After I got my diagnosis I found that I was so, so angry that there wasn't a simple fix to this. I couldn't just ""live right"" or science this away.  Its there for a lifetime, and while you may find that you go longer and longer with fewer symptoms as you get used to avoiding your triggers you may always have to take them into consideration before you do things.  There's a lot of anger and resentment that can be tied up in a diagnosis like that, and a counselor or therapist can help you talk through that and give you a setting to process it without feeling like a broken record."
"Give plaquenile  a couple of months. There could be an improvement with you fatigue symptoms. If caffeine doesn't cause stomach, dehydration or sleep issues for you there's no reason to avoid it."
Dry mouth = Try Biotene before bed every night. Its a moisturizing mouthwash that can keep you from drying out over night.

Dry eyes = Try gel eyedrops before bed every night.

"Fatigue, mental fog, poor concentration.  The plaquenil helps me a lot with this, but it takes a while to kick in.  I'm not sure how recently you started on the Vit. D but it helped too, along with 5000mcg of B12/day.  The biggest aid in this, though, was learning to recognize my fatigue triggers and avoid them or budget to only have so many in a day."

"Like, if I need to run a lot of errands in a day I may plan to eat out for dinner.  If I'm going to spend the day outdoors I'll bring sunscreen, a floppy hat, sunglasses, a UV resistant shirt, and a ton of water.  Dehydration is a huge trigger for me, as are UV and heat exposure.  Even an hour in sunny 85+ degree weather will have me overdoing it."

"Think of your energy like a budget.  You only get so many units of energy in a day (commonly called spoons), and some days you might find that you have more spoons than normal and some days you might have fewer. But you need to start thinking about how to guard your spoons, even if it means letting go of some things or doing them a different less energy intense way.  And I don't just mean physical energy.  Emotionally or intellectually draining events will eat up your spoons just as fast as running or lifting weights."

"Testing your limits will come with a lot of days where you failed to manage correctly and you may spend a couple of days needing to recoup your energy.  Don't feel discouraged, you're learning!"
**Spoon theory**

"The spoon theory is a disability metaphor and neologism used to explain the reduced amount of energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or chronic illness. ""Spoons"" are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. Each activity requires a given number of spoons, which will only be replaced as the person ""recharges"" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished."

There are some [studies ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26708168)that have suggested that there is a correlation between traumatic life events and autoimmunity.
"Yes, I have read that actually many autoimmune disorders are oftentimes connected to a trauma, sjögren’s included."
Mine started after I had whooping cough & seems to get a bit worse after a virus. The worst increase of symptoms happened after chemo.
The thing about diseases where not much is known is that nobody knows.  It's possible trauma is the direct cause.  It's possible you already had it and only noticed because the doctor's were looking at you more closely after the traumatic event.  It's possible that the two had nothing to do with each other but timing.
This is absolutely a thing. I developed my Sjogrens after a traumatic life event.
My symptoms went into overdrive after I had back surgery.
Very interesting and yeah I believe it. I went through an immense amount of physical pain and emotional stress that led up to being diagnosed.
I know this might sound strange but my symptoms started showing up after I got breast implants.
i think it can be a trigger yes along with infections toxins etc.

Trauma causes real changes to our brains and our  autonomic  center in the brain controls the immune system.
"I just had cancer surgery,  no chemo,  but the trauma was probably enough.  A car accident triggered this for me."
I'm sure mine started after I had whooping cough! I never really went back to feeling 100% after I had it.
"Me too, it was like suddenly it showed up with all the symptoms.  Drs think it may have been living dormant and trauma kick started it"
"There's discussion of link between silicone, silicone implants and pSS in book, 'Sjogren's Syndrome: Novel Insights in Pathogenic, Clinical and Therapeutic Aspects' -- by  [Alessia Alunno](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Alessia+Alunno&search-alias=books&field-author=Alessia+Alunno&sort=relevancerank) (Editor), [Elena Bartoloni](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2?ie=UTF8&text=Elena+Bartoloni&search-alias=books&field-author=Elena+Bartoloni&sort=relevancerank) (Editor), [Roberto Gerli](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_3?ie=UTF8&text=Roberto+Gerli&search-alias=books&field-author=Roberto+Gerli&sort=relevancerank) (Editor) chapter 10 entitled 'Sjögren’s Syndrome and Environmental Factors'"

&#x200B;
"Not strange at all, the brain is a fascinating organ"
Then I'm really in trouble :(
I'm always tired. I also do that quite often. I'm not sure if it's SS or if I have chronic fatigue syndrome in addition...

"I have sleep emergencies, where I get cognitive issues and whatnot, and I need to sleep right away or it feels like I am going to die."
Flares.


"Also, I've noticed myself doing that a lot when I don't get enough b-1 (thiamine), folate, and b-12. I don't eat a lot of enriched products (next to no bread/cereals/etc). If you eat similarly, or high-protein/low-ish carbs/whole grains instead of refined sugars/flours, maybe try adding a b-complex vitamin and a good daily vitamin and see if that helps?"
Only some days.  It wont always be that way but in occasion it will be necessary.
"Possibly. My fatigue has been progressive over 26 years, to the point that I am perpetually groggy, even when taking medication prescribed for wakefulness. It's completely disabling. I do all of the right things, like good sleep health, exercise, etc."

"I have run into others with Sjögren's Syndrome who just don't have refreshing sleep and are also ridiculously fatigued. It's blamed on the infiltration of our moisture glands, but I'd like a more satisfactory answer!"
"I have done this more times than I can count. As another poster said, it’s not always like that. My mother has Sjogren’s AND lupus so she has a double dose of extreme fatigue, but even she manages to have her good days."
"yup! sometimes it doesnt matter how much you sleep, you will wake up feeling tired."
"I normally find I get like that when I've been really busy or active over a number of days, by the time the busy spell has ended my body just goes ""sorry guys, i gotta take a day off"". Its spoon theory basically - if you use up all your spoons you gotta wait til you've got more til you can use them again :)"
i always thought it sounded daft but its a good way about thinking about your energy and managing your condition without feeling like a failure (cos that can also happen). Here's the wiki if you havent heard of it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory
"Me, too. Usually when my nerves start going on high volume. Then it's ""get outta my way, bed, here I come!"""
"Fatigue is a common symptom of Sjogren's, a CFS diagnosis probably would be meaningless since it's an idiopathic, umbrella dx."
I second this. I occasionally have days with awful fatigue but I have fewer of them now that I take B-12 and folate every day.
This may be important for all people off gluten.
Spoon theory makes perfect sense. Convincing someone that they have 20 spoons and you only have one is sometimes impossible.
"Have you tried beta blockers? They lower my blood pressure a bit, but it's worth it to me not to be hung out all day. I hate benzos. When I need them the most they actually make anxiety worse instead of better."
I see...so I guess the other symptoms I have such as hypotension come from the tiredness? My eyesight goes out when I go from laying down to sitting.
"I think the problem is our liver. Rheumy is always checking enzymes because sjo can really screw with your liver, and b vitamins are all effected by liver. I finally figured it out when I realized that I had a little double vision, and the Google says thiamine deficiency. Started thiamine, no double vision! Niacin, though, can make liver problems worse, so you have to supplement with a good one that only has 100% rda of niacin or less while still providing enough thiamine. Sometimes experimentation works!"
"Oh, definitely. I am not gluten free, and you can get some thiamine from oats or some other whole grains, but I just don't eat much in the way of enriched flours, which have the entire RDA of thiamine, iron, and folate added in. I am more of an intermittent fasting person, and I just try to focus on whole grains, protien, and healthy fats (and fresh veggies but I am not a huge fan of fruit, have to force myself to eat fruit!). My kud is Diabetic, so that diet works best for her, too, because it keeps her blood sugar stable (not the intermittent fasting, though, for her, but the rest of it!). I forget how much of our nutrients are added in to processed foods, though, and needed to supplement to make it better. I also happen to be a very picky eater, so my whole grains are limited to brown rice, barley occasionally, sprouted wheat bread or tortillas very rarely, and some wheat berries if I have time to cook them up and make them the way I like them!"
"I take both meds already, I've been on a super low dose for a decade and it keeps my BP perfect. My sleep emergencies usually stem from being over tired and over stimulated in combination with a high pain day or moment (back surgery 2 yrs ago, peripheral nerve pain, restless legs, etc). I use Vyvanse to help keep me awake and alert during the day, but when it wears off or I skip it, all bets are off. Saturday I got up at 7 am, decided to skip Vyvanse for the day, took my kid to work, came home and laid down for a nap at 10, slept until 3:00, picked kid up and watched a movie, went to bed at 10 pm and slept straight until 9 am Sunday. Without that stuff I'd be out of work and homeless, I think."
"There are things that cause all that. For instance, Addison's, a lack of cortisone production by your adrenal glands can cause all the above. So could Sjogren's for that matter. Some of us Sjogren's patients (like me)  have autonomic nerve problems and our breathing, blood pressure, digestion, any autonomic function, can be dysfunctional. It happens because of damage to our small-fiber nerves when they're attacked by our own antibodies."

"If I were you I'd talk to a really good internist in your area (Google Scholar one in your area who is publishing research; s/he will be more likely to be up on new things, like POTS diagnosis (dx) and then if anything shows up on blood work that indicates inflammation, ask for a referral to a rheumatologist and the rheumatologist will probably refer you to a neurologist."

"Heh, one of those times you actually \*can\* blame the ""victim."""
Interesting. I didn't know it could affect the liver. I started taking B-12 supplements after the doc gave me a B-12 shot for fatigue once and I felt amazingly energized for days. It does pay to experiment!
"I'm basically paleo in spirit but not in practice lately. I'm too exhausted to shop and cook. I have a histamine intolerance and I'm just not ready to face what that entails, yet, as far as changing my diet so I have to take antihistamines just to function. Otherwise the flood of histamines makes me sick as a dog and shuts my memory down almost totally. It's scary. I'm so sick to my stomach constantly I'm always on the verge of dry heaves. Blehh."

"So, I have to make myself eat just to be able to take my meds without puking or getting cold sweats. The only thing safe and ready is gluten-free bread. I just don't want to eat veggies and meat right now. I'll get back on the paleo train as soon as I'm feeling better."

"Are you a guy? Have heard interstitial fasting may not be suitable for women, though beneficial for men."
"I've had restless leg. Infuriating torture! Just as I was finally chilled enough to fall asleep, the same trigger for sleep seemed to set the jumping off in my leg. Shake my ass straight awake. Over and over."


"And the PN; mine is caused by Sjogren's, sounds like you have some kind of autoimmune thing happening, maybe, too. ""Profound fatigue"" is probably the symptom we most have in common, but there are lots of them, and they seem disparate if you don't see the causal relationship in the context of a known disorder. Autoimmune diagnoses are really tricky still, and lots of docs aren't operating with the best info."
"Interesting [little study about liver involvement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC128830/). Seems very common, but doctors don't always assume it's connected."
"I am definitely female, and have seen some good studies that include women. Some great data points to it reducing bp, inflammatory markers, and insulin needs, so I'm trying it out. I already eat late in the day, now I'm just stopping earlier, too. I'm doing the 16:8 method."
"I have Sjogren's and no other official diagnosis, but was told fibromyalgia as well by a neurologist I'm not sure I trust. Sjogren's does so much craziness..."
"I have primary SS,  thyroid cancer, Hashimotos, fibromyalgia, 12 brain lesions and NASH (Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis) My liver is in stage 2-3 liver disease and there's no cure..I'm 39f."
"I'm told if my liver doesn't repair itself, I will need a transplant or will get liver cancer."
"Oh, and I'm currently being tested for lymphoma, MRIs aren't looking so good apparently."

"I sleep so much I can't work, and never know which condition is causing what. I just try to live with a smile."
Thanks!
Have you tried:

* eye goggles for sleeping
* eye gel (stays in longer than drops)
"* eye lotion (stays in even longer, but not my cup of tea)"
* punctum plugs (prevents precious tears from leaving)
"* wrap-around sunglasses (I wear mine in the sun, in the rain, inside, idgaf)"
* vitamins/supplements


Best of luck!!
"Not weird at all to me. I actually tell my husband I want to dunk myself in oil all the time, especially in the winter!!"
I use body oils after my shower or body scrub that is oil based in the shower. You can topically use olive or coconut oils over your lashes (closed eyes not in ) and then use a warm compress to remove excess.
"I have kind of a basics attitude toward cosmetic products. I figure if a gentle, organic shampoo is okay for my head, it's okay for my skin, so I use it instead of liquid soap, etc; because it's basically the same stuff; detergent mixed with some oil so you aren't completely stripped of moisture."

"I figure it's similar with hair conditioner. My huge bottle of Costco hair conditioner also helps moisturize my skin. I rub it all over just before a quick final rinse in the shower. It's not enough to replace lotion, but it makes post-bath lotion go on much easier and I need less."
I know I'm late to this but I just discovered this sub and I've never seen anyone else mentioning being dunked in lotion; I've been using that phrase since high school!
"The closest I've ever gotten was using a bath bomb from lush, it was super moisturizing but had a lot of fragrance and gave me hives :("
I've also daydreamed about just sitting down naked in a vat of lotion. My skin has been painfully dry for so long I can't remember any other way. It often cracks open and bleeds on my hands.
"As someone with Sjogren’s, how much Berberine does she take?"
Thank you!
"She seems to have settled into 2 of the Solaray pills/day, which are 535g/pill (each pill has 250mg Berberine HCL + 285g Oregon Grape extract).  Please let me know if it helps/hurts you, and also make SURE to check the drug interactions since Berberine can interact with many drugs.  Hope it is some use to you -"

"I'm going to try it, too. Thanks."

"Would it be possible to find two part time jobs where you could have a break during the day to rest and recharge? Or see if a full time job would be willing to work with alternative hours for you so that maybe you could have a lunch break that is 2 or 3 hours? Depending on where you live, if a doctor insists that you need a 2 or 3 hour break in the middle of the day, your workplace has to accommodate you if it is considered a reasonable accommodation.  I also found going to work later in the morning extremely helpful. You could also consider the type of work. Some jobs are more physically or mentally taxing than others. See if you can figure out what would be the least taxing for you and try to get a job doing that. Perhaps a call center operator (the least taxing job I ever had)."

"There are medications that can help you sleep such as anti-depressants and sleep aids. I found they made me too lethargic during the day, but they might work for you. Four key things that have helped me: regular exercise (strength and cardio - nothing high intensity); regular sleep times (go to bed and wake up same time each day); naps or rest periods in the middle of the day; and smart use of caffeine (minimum amount needed to get some energy and stop taking it in the afternoon so I can still sleep well). I was able to continue working (for awhile), but while I worked full time, I never had any energy for things like cleaning or grocery shopping or even just hanging out with friends. I don't work anymore and while I miss working immensely (work relationships, the challenges, decent income), I am better able to manage my diseases now and my quality of life has improved."



"I have Sjogren's and 17 years ago got hit with Fibro after my divorce when I got custody of my then 6 y/o son.  I'm a guy, so I got cut very little slack at work and, between my job and being Mr. Mom, baseball/soccer/basketball practices/games, and schoolwork, I was working myself stupid and was deadman walking for a long time.  I only recommend it as a last resort, but Nuvigil helped me until I learned to better manage and pace myself.  It's not a ""go to"" medicine as it has abuse potential for some.  Things got better as my son got older, but it took its toll on me.  Learning I can't be all things to all people all the time was an important life lesson.  You have to just say no to people sometimes.  Exercise sounds contradictory for fatigue, but if it's done slowly and methodically it can help.  It helped me.  Getting a handle on your sleep is very important.  I had lots of setbacks but you have to persevere. Each of us has our own unique situation and unfortunately there isn't a magic solution to this problem.  Run from anyone who tells you there is.  Good luck."
"Also in my twenties and while I don't have debilitating fatigue, I find myself getting sick fairly often (I have stomach complications). This may sound extreme, but I'm actually going back to grad school to get a degree in a field that will offer me more flexibility/downtime (counseling). That's an option, too."
"I am currently working 2 part time jobs and I am taking antidepressants and anti anxiety medication. I get plenty of sleep, and I'll find myself taking naps as well when I'm not at work. I'm constantly sleepy. I was exercising all of the time, I definitely need to get back to doing that. My work schedule is a little odd and constantly changing, so it's difficult to have a set time to go to sleep and wake up. I don't drink any caffeine or coffee."
"Thank you, I appreciate your kind words :)"
"If you go back to exercising try an easier exercise routine and maybe a shorter one, like 15 minutes, just to make sure it isn't making things worse. It's so tricky trying to balance our low energy with what we want or need to do. Chances are your quality of sleep is like mine: no matter how much I get it never seems enough. I found out (through a lot of trial and error) that my limit for exercise is about 20 or 30 minutes tops. Any more than that and I just crash a few weeks later. Have you heard of [patients like me](https://www.patientslikeme.com/)? It's a free website where you can find people with similar conditions and see what's worked for them and what hasn't. People can review meds they have tried and there are forums to connect with others. You might find some help there too. I wish I had some more help for you. It really is tricky with chronic fatigue."

Edit: grammar
"Thank you so much for your input! :) it also puts my mind at ease that I did the right thing by leaving my job, though stable, I was mentally and physically exhausted. Taking a break and working less hours has helped immensely."
"Hi :) I get at least nine hours of sleep every night, and try my best not to stress out. I work in an open office and it's so draining. I have fibro and lupus as well. My next job NEEDS to have some flexibility, where I can either work remotely or from home several times a week. I also meditate at least 15 minutes a day and workout 3-4 times a week on the elliptical. I also try to eat healthy..."

"You could take some time to really think about what you want to do for work and what you can actually do. Before I got sick, I was planning on opening my own small farm business (photosensitivity ruined that plan), but now I am studying for a copyediting certificate so that I can have the option of freelancing. Feel free to ask me any more questions! I am a 33-year-old woman, by the way."
I show people a copy of that article whenever someone thinks my daily naps aren't important.
This is the first thing I've read here and I finally feel like I'm not crazy :')
Does napping interfere with you sleeping well at night? I rest/relax but try not to nap during the day because I think it messes with how I sleep at night. I absolutely hate not sleeping.
It really helped me define the different types of fatigue I experience.
"If I nap before 4 pm, I am usually fine at sleeping at night since I don't go to bed until around 10 or 11 pm. Resting/relaxing also helps, but it often isn't enough especially on days I exercise or have quite a bit to do."
"I have sjogren's, fibromyalgia, small fiber neuropathy, and migraines. I also have Chronotropic Intolerance. I get the really bad tension headaches alot where a band feels like it's slowly crushing my head. I get dizzy alot, uncoordinated, clumsy, constantly forget what I'm doing... While doing it. The list just goes on and on but alot of our issues are the same."

Things I've tried or an currently doing:
"-Chewable meclizine from the pharmacy. You don't need a prescription. It helps with the dizziness alot. It's the non drowsy main ingredient in dramamine. Docs prescribe it for dizziness, nausea, travel sickness, motion sickness."

I'm sure there are more things but brain fog is making this post difficult.

Things to look into:
POTS- neurologist
Tension headaches - neurologist
Chronotropic Intolerance - cardiologist
"(my heart doesn't speed up when I need it to. i.e. Working out, scared, stressed, anxious which causes me to get really dizzy or actually pass out. I ended up with a pacemaker before I was 30 because of sick sinus syndrome and chronotropic intolerance. It caused 3rd degree AV block."
Fibromyalgia- neurologist or rheumatologist
This is known to be an issue for many people with sjogren's and can cause alot of the problem you stated.

That is all I can think of for now. Definitely talk to your doctor about any of these that might help you. Also feel free to DM me if you have any questions or would like a more in depth explanation on how any of this effected me.
Have you been checked for meniere's disease? I've had those symptoms twice & my GP gave me Serc-16 tablets which really helped the second time. The first time I was a lot worse & it was physiotherapy that cured me then.
How are your iron levels?
I have spent the entire summer with all of this. I’ve even wondered if I had a stroke or something. I’m following because it’s impacted my life terribly the last several months.
"I have the same conditions you do, in addition to chronic migraines (and some other fun stuff.) It sounds like migraine to me, but I’m no expert. Someone experiencing migraines does not have to get aura (the light flashes/light show you describe.) There is a protocol to take magnesium, CoQ10, and vitamin B2 to reduce migraines, maybe that would help you?"

"On the subject of migraine medication, I can tell you it sometimes takes decades to find the right treatment. I have tried almost every migraine medication in existence and very few actually help. I would definitely suggest seeing a really good neurologist ASAP"
"The physio gave me acupuncture & some eye exercises, yes, eye exercises, she explained she was trying to get the messages between my eyes, ears & feet to work properly. I was sceptical & felt worse for a couple of weeks but it definitely cured the problem. It wasn't Meniere's & I didn't get a diagnosis."
"I wear compression socks, to prevent dizziness.  I've never been tested for POTTS so I have no idea if I should be wearing compression socks, but they do work for me."
To help with vertigo I got bonine. It literally saved me and actually am able to sit up and make food without feeling horribly dizzy and nauseous.
"I have a lot of weird head issues too. Strange mild to moderate pain, shifting, and and pressure sensations, dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo. It comes and goes, a few times a day. I've had a stroke, at first I thought it was related to that, but my neurologist says not likely. I've had every kind of scan and imaging that can be done and nothing unusual showed up. Vision tested, eye pressure tested, sinus cavities checked, and all normal. It's not debilitating, just unsettling and annoying. My rheumatologist said it may be Sjogren's related. Nobody is too concerned about it though because other than feeling weird and uncomfortable, it doesn't affect my life much, my vitals and labs are good, and the scans and other tests were clear. It's been noted in my charts but that's about it."
Thank you so much!  That is a very detailed and useful post!  I’ll definitely try those/bring them up with my doctor!
"I have not, but I will look into it!  What did they have you do in physiotherapy?  I am seeing a physical therapist, but they seem to be treating it as if I forgot how to use/feel my limbs, which seems odd."
Iron is fine according to my blood tests.  Right in the middle of normal range.
Thanks for letting me know I’m not alone!
"I will try that!  I’m seeing a neurologist, and I’m not unhappy with him except that he is so convinced it is migraine and has nothing to do with Sjögren’s.  But maybe I should just go with that for now."
"Thanks for the head’s up about migraine meds.  Sigh.  I hate the whole “months of trying different drugs” thing...it’s so depressing to focus on the discomfort to measure it, instead of doing my best to ignore it and get on with life."
Chiropractors can also align the Crystal's in your inner ear and this will provide relief also.
"Thank you!  I’d never heard of compression sock before today, but I’ll give them a try (I think it’s time for me to setup a formalized multivariable experiment with all the things people have suggested, otherwise I’ll never keep track!  You guys are all awesome.)"
Thanks!  I’ll give that a try.
"That sounds very similar.  I wonder if you are just more skilled at ignoring it, whereas I can’t seem to focus on anything but it.  (Possibly because it’s new and scares me.) Are you doing anything in particular to help keep your mental focus?"
No problem. One thing I've learned is doctors aren't Dr. House. We have to advocate for outsells and do our own research because doctors aren't all knowing. Sometimes the puzzle pieces don't fit until you point out or for them.
I have no other suggestions.... But I have seen people mention POTS in a few groups. You might want to look into that also.
Had same.  Turned out it was mini strokes.   Blood thinners fixed.

Neurologists and ER repeatedly missed.
"I have put effort into learning to block it out. I don't know for sure what is causing the head issues. I have Sjogren's, had a stroke, am in perimenopause, and take a lot of medications. It could be any of those things causing it. But I was having panic attacks whenever I'd have a weird head sensation or pain and learned self calming techniques. Breathing exercises, visual imagery meditations, calming mantras. I was thoroughly checked out and nothing bad or dangerous is happening."
Thanks!  That does seem to match the symptoms pretty well!  I’ll see if I can get tested for it.
I'm sorry you're having to live with this and without support. It makes me think of last spring when I was twitching all the time because of the painful pricklings. I was also bruising because I was scratching/rubbing/slapping myself so much to make the sensations stop. My neuro upped my Lamictal dose to alleviate the neuropathy. Have you seen a neuro about your experiences? Hope you find support and relief.
I am sorry you are hurting. I take Lyrica for the pain and tramadol. I can’t take anything else because of kidney issues. I hope you get relief and know that we support you here.
"Well, I’m an idiot. You are having total body neuropathy. Lyrica will help and you can function. On that. There are coupons from the manufacturer that make it affordable."
You may also have fibromyalgia . That contributes to the tingling and pinprick sensations you may feel all over your skin?
The Rheumatologist has refused me Plaquenil so the GPs will not prescribe it.  I have rarely been so angry and lost.
I also twitch too :( They won't refer me to the neurologist.  They don't consider that I need to be seen.      I'm at a loss.  Gagapentin?
Can I still working taking pain killers?  I have Duloxetine and got some Neurotonin from someone.  Was too difficult going through GP.  Will they perhaps help?
I have that? :( Please say I don't have all this.  I am in the UK so it would cost very little on the NHS but I can't get them to support me properly.
Tramadol is what helps me with pain.
Perhaps they don't understand that small-fiber neuropathy happens in 30% of people with Sjogren's. Do you have any autonomic dysfunction? That's also common in small-fiber neuropathy. Gabapentin could help; be wary of mental health side effects from it.
That's a common and from what I understand effective one.
"How do you feel? Do the pain meds make you sleepy or sluggish? I can’t function at my type of job, but I think it depends on your pain levels and what you do for a living. I wish you the very best in your journey to wellness."
I've been told to stay away from it especially as it woukd make me too drowsy.  :(
"They won't diagnose me with Sjogrens, only Sicca.  It's all the same symptoms as far as I can tell.  I don't think my autonomic system is affected?  I get night sweats at times."
I already have depression and ADHD so i don't want any more problems :(.  They also refuse to test for me SFN.
Sluggish and sleepy.  I am losing the ability to function.  It is almost impossible.  If I lose the ability to work I lose my life.  It's that simple.
If i take 3 in 6 hours I get drowsy.

2 or less and I'm good.

I'm not allowed to take most pain relievers due to clotting disorder.   So far this one seems to work for me.
Inability to keep body temperature stable is a common autonomic issue.
Checked for sleep apnea?
Can you change doctors?? This treatment is ridiculous.
"Not everyone gets the horrible gaba side effects. I did. It was unbelievably deep overnight depression. But doc said stop the drugs, and the issue got better over 3 days. Wow, that was really weird, though. It was frightening."


"In the same breath, some people rave about how well it helps them. You may not know unless you try it. Is your doc offering it?"
I understand. We share that situation. What kind of pain are you experiencing?
I've had moments where I sweat in my sleep and I've had a few hot flushes in the past but it's been quite some time since I had any.
I'm pretty sure I don't.  How do you check for this anyway?
I have gone to other doctors.  They say the same.  I have given up and am considering spending all my savings on going private or just giving up completely.
My doctor has only accepted grudgingly so I just have it but haven't started it yet.
"Only one out of ten with sicca have Sjogren's, but I'm not really comfortable with the accuracy of that number given how much prevalence has risen lately. Tells me we don't know prevalence."
Snoring is biggest sign.  Waking up sweaty.  Gasping for air is another.
I get it. I saw 23 doctors before finally being diagnosed with celiac disease and a pile of other autoimmune diseases. You almost have to know what's wrong already and go to the people who are researching that thing. It sucks.
"Just know the mental health side effects can be horrid, but will go away quickly once meds are stopped. It wouldn't hurt to have people in your life also looking out for that, because you may not notice it when it starts happening; we tend, as human in the world, to hang our outlook on outward events when sometimes it's our internal chemistry. It can take a second of introspection to realize it, and sadly, introspection will lag if you're in a panic situation. Wishing you the best."
Only sometimes in the middle of the night.  Night sweats.  Doesn't happen often.  I don't know if I snore but nobody has ever said I do.  I don't remember ever gasping for air.  Maybe I did once but I thought it was a bad dream.
23? :(  Nightmare.
"It was over 13 years, and I only had so many because everytime I moved with my husband's retail job, I had to get another medical team (one or two tries at GPs, a gyno and a rheumatologist. It was, coincidentally, the average number of doctors at the time (2002), that the average celiac saw before dx.  I \*knew\* I was seriously sick, and was worried I'd die from it before getting answers, but also I think I conveyed so much learned doubt during the appointments that I think I may have made it worse than it could have been had I felt confident."
Fish oil would not cause bleeding gums. FYI I’m a dental hygienist. Make sure she is brushing 3x/day and flossing daily. She should also be examined by a dentist to check for periodontal disease. Dry mouth causes all kinds of issues in the mouth. I also recommend biotene rinse and sugar free lozenges or gum to help stimulate saliva production.
"Hmm. I take 2000mg of EPA (omega via is brand) a day, and have never had bleeding gums. I’ve been taking it for a few years. I would probably decrease your dosage to 1,000 and see if it goes away! Maybe it’s just too much for you."

"Tough crowd, with the downvote 😂"
I was prescribed 2000 but only take 1000 ( for financial reasons). Don’t have any trouble
Thanks for the info. I’ve never encountered a patient that took this much. Apologies. I’m not having a good day. In a flare. Good to know that she is on a 3 month record!
That’s important that you have a good Hygienist. I’ve been in the field for 25 yrs and there are some that are rough and have bad bedside. Hope you’re gums clear up. One thing I just thought of is warm salt water rinse. This might soothe and help with healing. Good luck.
"Hi, peacocking.  Thanks for your answer!  I stopped the fish oil after reading this:"

"""Bleeding gums and nosebleeds are two of the hallmark side effects of excess fish oil consumption."

"One study in 56 people found that supplementing with 640 mg of fish oil per day over a four-week period decreased blood clotting in healthy adults."""

That's inhibition of platelet aggregation at 1/3 the dose I was taking.  I haven't read the original study and probably wouldn't be able to evaluate it if I did.

"My dental care is excellent, but I'm on three-month recall as a precaution."
Do you keep it in the fridge?  I recently found out that that is the recommendation.

"I used to store my cheap fish oil in the cupboard over the toaster and the slow cooker.  In retrospect, that might have been a problem.  The capsule form means you can't tell if the fish oil inside has gone rancid, and I've been reading that rancid fish oil is really bad for you."
"It's me, actually.  Hope your day improves ... it's a rotten illness.  (& god bless all of you hygienists:  I had some gum inflammation after my symptoms started, but my current pro seems to have pulled me out of it.  She is skillful, gentle, and positive.)"
:)
"I feel that 2,000 is a very high dose. I take that dose, because it helps me feel better! I certainly did not start off on that dose though. I took 500-1000 for many years, and then slowly started taking more just a couple years ago. The higher dose has helped me with anxiety and I’ve had no side effects, and that’s why I continue it. I’ve been thinking of decreasing to 1500 lately to see how I feel, and then maybe I’ll get down to 1000."

"If you find your gums are better without the fish oil, you have your answer! And I’d probably only take a very low dose of it then if you decide to resume. If you still have the issue though, even without the fish oil, other things can cause bleeding gum issues even if you have excellent dental hygiene...mainly hormones."
Yes I always keep it in the fridge. I never buy cheap fish oil. A lot of it is already rancid according to BBC program and therefore of no use to you. Don’t know where you are but my specialist recommended Ethical Nutrient (Australia) brand so that’s what I get
"Thanks for this post!  I was on 660 for many yrs without issue, but there may have been a problem with the integrity of that oil.  (Could the Nordic Naturals be more potent?)  I'll talk to my nutritionist about this at my next appt."
Thanks!
"It could be a potency thing...they’re definitely not all created equal. Do you think you’re taking anything else that could be anti coagulating? I haven’t done enough research to know that much, but I think turmeric and garlic...and probably a whole host of things could compound the effects of the fish oil. R/nootropics is usually very knowledgeable about things like that. I think some of them take black seed oil in lieu of fish oil."
"Interesting!  I have been adding garlic to anything it fits, but not more than 2 cloves a day.  I'll keep paying attention."
My wife (patient) and I went last year and we have a Team participating this year.
Great event
"Great organization and if you want to learn more about them, check out the podcast “Sjogren’s Strong”. Tomorrow’s episode is an interview with the President and CEO of the foundation."
"The podcast is my wife’s, I’m the co-host and we are not affiliated with the foundation but support them."
"Also they have support groups in Long Beach, TORRANCE and the IE, and 63 other locations across the country FREE"
The walk is short due to various conditions of people in attendance.

Well worth it and hope to meet you.
"Not trying to make this a ""begging for donations"" post but if anyone wanted to even throw a single dollar towards my [girlfriend's fund](http://events.sjogrens.org/site/TR/Events/General?px=1126983&pg=personal&fr_id=1330&fbclid=IwAR2KD5mHUGzNtAOpMZQuNFMm7Hqzcfbm7qePxhHL7xuTCn7eS9W0IddafdE) she would be ecstatic. Thank you all"
"Awesome, thanks so much for the info. We will definitely check out y'alls podcast!"
"Here is the link to the interview with Steven Taylor, President and CEO of the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation."

[https://sjogrensstrong.com/steven-taylor-president-ceo-of-the-sjogrens-syndrome-foundation/](https://sjogrensstrong.com/steven-taylor-president-ceo-of-the-sjogrens-syndrome-foundation/)
"Sorry, but I assumed you are in Southern California, because we have an upcoming walk. If not, check out the foundations website and search support groups to find more info. They are sorted by state."

"Stay strong, Diet matters big time."
"No worries, I know they have them all over. Thanks!"

"We both started the AIP diet last week, hoping it helps"
Keep us posted  and stay positive.
Once things get controlled you can have good days.
"We still cycle, hike, camp etc."
Thank you
"I understand what your mother must be feeling. I've had a similar experience... used to be able to go, go, go, now have to pace myself and pay attention to my body for signs that I need to slow down."

"The most helpful thing for me has been having even just one or two people that understand what I'm going through and how my needs have changed, and who are there for moral support, and to help as needed. Even if just to offer some company."

It sounds like you are off to a good start though 🙂 keep spending time with her and being there for her.
"Help her attack the symptoms with the best options available.  There are many good recommendations here.  Her life will be different, but it will continue.  I have learned to appreciate what I have much more and other things don’t bother me as much.  Compared to this dumb illness, the day-to-day stresses aren’t so bad."
"It's great that she has someone like you to support her. It can be really hard asking for help. I think this might be one thing to ask her about. I know that for me, it has to get really bad before I ask for help. This is both because I don't want to inconvenience anyone, but also because I don't like admitting I can't do something. Each person's limits and symptoms are different (and may be very different whether they're having a flare or not). Having permission from people to have days where I just can't do anything has helped."

"Finding ways to help her destress can help. If she's having trouble with calming her nerves, maybe some warm soup or tea can help. Listening to music is another one that helps me. Soft things, like blankets and warm fuzzy socks help. Another one that's helped me with dry mouth when I'm on the go is biotene spray."
I spent years trying all kinds of medications for my rashes/eczema. I changed my diet and it all went away. Maybe start eliminating some foods and see if that helps?
"Ugh. Same. But I get it on my face 😭 it’s impossible to wear makeup over it and I’ve tried SO SO many things to cure it. From what I can tell, nothing has actually cured it, but I only use sensitive skin wash and lotion, and if it’s bad I’ll put some hydrocortisone cream on it- this seems to help a bit, although it never fully goes away. Mine is also worsened by the sun; this was a crazy/difficult revelation for me because I’ve always been super outdoorsy with no issues! It sucks!"
"I had it once and a holistic doc told me to cut out milk, I did and it went away. A lot of people are allergic to milk and it tends to cause skin issues."
Is it really eczema or is it psoriasis?  Specifically psoriatic arthritis?
Tasted negative for psoriasis. Rheumo says it’s eczema.
Hi. I saw elsewhere you have EDS various type of eczema can have there roots in this. Does your dermatologist know about the eds?
Ah right. In the UK an orthopedic Dr or Rhumatologist does our diagnostic stuff. I'd never even heard or a geneticist until Facebook was invented!
"Thanks for sharing. I have been feeling awfully self conscious between that and my recent weight gain,"
Dang. I’ve already cut dairy out years ago. It was a great suggestion though!

We may have found the culprit. I am pumping out DHEA-sulfate at like four times the level I should be. So it’s endocrinology AND rheumatology for me!
"Yes, and that’s a loaded topic because they all disagree on whether I have EDS or BJHS and if the geneticist made an accurate diagnosis because Type III can be diagnosed with Beighton/Brighton, blah, blah, blah."

"Dermatologist says it looks autoimmune, Rheumatologist says it looks fungal but the sample said no. Both are too focused on whether they agree with the geneticist to do much else than send me on a crazy round of appointments."

"In the meantime, I found that Tiger Balm distracts me from the itching and actually seems to be helping, so I’m about to fire the whole lot of them."
"I get it. I literally spend my lunch breaks pulling flaking skin off my face with tweezers it’s so bad. And the weight gain...idk if fatigue is an issue for you, but I’ve been hit HARD. I feel like I can’t mentally or physically do anything after a certain point, much less work out anymore. There’s so many little, random things to this shitty disease that makes me want to pull my own hair out."

"I’ll say that (obviously) everyone gets self conscious, but I’m not sure it’s at the level that we have :/ it’s absolutely unfair, but when I’m feeling some type of way about it or a random symptom seems to pop up in conversation, I’ll just casually slip in “WHAT. I have a fucking autoimmune, like, my body is literally trying to destroy itself, what do you want me to do about it?” And then smile and casually dismiss the conversation lol. I’m not generally one for excuses, but in this case, it’s a forreal excuse."

"You’re doing what you can. No one else can expect any more, so don’t expect anymore from yourself. If something is out of your control, (excuse my French) fuck it and anyone who judges you for it."

"This being said, you are definitely your own worst enemy. And...I’ll drop the cliche remarks here, because I know how annoying it is and it’s not always as easy as people make it out to be with their advice. But feel free to PM me if you’d ever like to chat."



"Side note: My vitamin levels are all over the place, too. Also, my serum ferritin was at like a 7 about a year ago before anyone caught it."
"If you have to pay for your care then I bloody would too. As for benign. I DESPISE that term and my go to reply is ""there is nothing benign about it"". The whole recent reclassification isn't helping many of us either. Have you been tested for MCAS? I think that's what it's called? That can affect the skin and is autoimmune. Tigar balm burns me. I used to swear by it but now I can't let it near me. I still sniff it though!!! 😄"
They won’t test me for MCAS. The allergist says I have to be off ALL otc allergy medicines for 2 weeks before they will test me. 36 hours and I’m so covered in hives that it’s ridiculous.

"I was originally diagnosed by a doctor who did his dissertation on EDS and studied it for years in Sweden. The problem is that he was an orthopedic surgeon and not a geneticist. I was there because my thumbs kept dislocating and he noticed my severe scoliosis. He ended up taking a full X-ray and studying my entire medical history. He did a lot of exams that I didn’t understand at the time, saying, “Are you aware that your shoulder shouldn’t move like this? I’m bending your elbow too far, are you sure this isn’t painful?” I was young and said, “Oh you think that’s weird, watch this!” Did my party tricks."

"I had scored high on both criteria. He diagnosed me. At the time, genetic diagnosis wasn’t really geographically feasible, nor was it covered by most insurances. But most doctors understood that. Now they’re saying ONLY a geneticist can diagnose it. *facepalm*"
"It makes sense - when a bug bite turns red and gets itchy, thats due to an autoimmune response."

"I don't think I've experienced this directly, but I have been flaring a lot lately and getting bitten to death by mosquitos."

"I live in FL and spend a lot of time on the back porch because of the humidity, its amazing, but the screens on my parents back porch are ripped to hell and aren't a priority for them to fix at the moment... maybe I need to press them a bit if this is making things worse for me."

Thanks for sharing this.
I had some fly bites and my skin went nuts. Apparently my hormones were out of whack and my thyroid had gone hypo and I ended up with an aggressive contact dermatitis that took over 70% of my skin and took 5 months and 5 specialists to resolve. It was so intense google turned off the ads on my blog post for “shocking content.” And I felt like I’d been hit by a truck. Any time our immune system has to go into battle it’s like playing roulette. I hope yours resolved quickly!

"Edit: adding, I also get a “cold” from scratches sometimes. Especially if it’s from a plant like rose thorns or cactus nettles."
Same thing happened to me last year when I got bit by a spider. Then it happened again after I got tore up by chiggers.
"I’m not sure bug bites cause flares for me but they make my autoimmune system crank in to high gear and overreact. Last week, I got a few mosquito bites and the itching all over my body was unbearable. A few years ago,I got a spider bite on my chest which caused hives all over and itching everywhere on my body. The doctor said the bite was close to the heart so it got into my bloodstream and pushed the venom all over my body. She said because of my autoimmune issues, it just went haywire trying to attack the venom. I hate steroids but took them and about a week later, I finally conquered the hives."
I literally joined reddit to find someone else that questioned the same thing!!

"I get bitten by ticks(I have dogs and live in a grassy area), and I always notice I have a flare up in fatigue and in my fingers and toes. The joint flare ups dont happen often, but I'm aware that it triggers those particular ones."
"My bloodwork was enough to start treatment. It was 2 years ago, so I don't recall all the details, but I know my rheumatoid factor also came into play. Sorry you're joining our club, but please reach out if you have questions I may be able to answer."
You shouldn't need a lip biopsy if your bloodwork is SSA/SSB positive - IIRC those are the *specific* markers for sjogren’s.

"Having personally had negative bloodwork and ending up getting the biopsy to get diagnosed, this is probably a good thing in the grand scheme."

"The rheumy will probably examine your joints and eyes/mouth. They'll also feel your lymph nodes (sjorgrens patients are at a slightly higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). They might do some other bloodwork. If they end up recommending certain ""disease modifying"" or immuno-modulating drugs (I can't remember which right now), they will do a tuberculosis test first, and in the very very slight chance you have a latent TB infection, they will want you to get treated for that before you take the drugs (they will explain all of this before it happens)."

"You might end up seeing an ophthalmologist at some point who might do a schirmer test, but my understanding is the SSA/SSB bloodwork is the main thing."

Next is discussing treatment.
"I had a lip biopsy because, although my bloodwork was strongly suggestive, I am male and I had no relatives with any autoimmune disorder."

The lip biopsy confirmed my diagnosis.
Thank you so much! I'm hoping that my treatment will come very soon!
"Thank you so much for the information--it's all incredibly helpful. The lip biopsy doesn't sound like a good time, so I'd like to avoid it if I can...And it sounds like I should be able to! I'd rather not have to do more testing that could delay treatment if possible😂"
I received a copy of my labs today:

ANA positive
Homogeneous pattern
SSB positive
"I can totally understand that. My mom has RA, so I'm starting to feel pretty positive that the blood work is correct."
"The lip biopsy wasn't bad (a plastic surgeon did mine), but the only reason I got one was because my bloodwork was negative. If my bloodwork had been positive I could've started treatment two years earlier."
The bad thing the saline has the preservative in.  I always put some eye ointment on the eye lids before bed in addition to drops in the eye.
Lol. I grabbed for my eye drops the other night and actually grabbed my e-liquid for my vape pen and yes I put it right in my eyes. It burned sooo bad. I'm alive and well though. Moved everything out of my own reach here on out. Ugh!
"I'm trying not to use soap, it really drys my skin. I recently discovered Aveeno make a soapless soap bar, I've been using it for about 6 weeks now, even on my hair. It's made a big difference. I've used Aveeno cream for about 15 years, at the same time as I found their soap I found Aveeno Intense Moisture cream. I think they're only available in Scotland on Amazon, I'm not saying my dry skin is gone but is greatly improved."
"Vaseline is a petroleum product, which actually can cause more dryness according to my doctor."

"I found [Fatco Fat Stick](https://www.fatco.com/products/fat-stick-0-5-oz) moisturizer stick that I use anywhere on my body that I need a little extra moisture. A little goes a long way, and it’s amazing stuff for us with our chronic dryness."

It is kind of expensive but lasts a long time. In the future I want to try mixing up my own based on the ingredients on the label.

Hope you find something that helps; those itchy ears can be distracting!
You can safely put a few drops of olive oil in your ear according to NHS https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/earwax-build-up/

I've seen oil ear drops in pharmacies. It's meant to help clean your ears but would probably solve the dryness issue too.
Thanks guys
"I use the ear drops for motion sickness.  Mainly for vertigo/dizziness, but they definitely keep the inside of the ear moist!  I get painful dry itchy ears too."
Every so often I get itchy  ears. I think at times it’s soap residue left behind. I usually put some sweet oil on a cotton swab.   Takes care of the itch.  There are times we blame Sjorgens for all our problems
Thanks for mentioning this. I think I’m going to pick one up.
"That is a good point, I have definitely found rinsing *really* well to be super important. I have less issues when I use a little less of a gentle soap and rinse well afterwards."

Love sweet almond oil too!
"Haven’t had gallbladder surgery but I’ve had 2 knee surgeries, kidney stone surgery, cataracts in both eyes and tonsillectomy in the last 5 years. Everything was ok afterward but the tonsillectomy. So painful and I got thrush."
"I haven't had surgery before, so I can't help you.  But you might also ask this question on the Sjogren's syndrome facebook group:"

"I recently had my wisdom teeth taken out and it went suprising well (I psyched myself out a bit because it was my first time being put under). I went on a slightly longer course of antibiotics and it took a few more days then normal to fully heal up, but I didn't have any complications. I was tired and felt kind of achy the first few days, possible Sjogren's related, but not sure. This isn't as major a surgery as gallbladder obviously, but this is my take. I went over all my concerns with my surgeon and he was very helpful in making sure I knew he was educated in Sjogren's enough to answer my concerns well. I was really concerned about my recovery time since I heal a lot slower than most. I'd just make sure you have good communication with your surgeon as well."
That’s an easy surgery
"You'll be a little groggy, then a little sore, but it'll pass and you'll be fine."
Personally I had been in extreme pain for 3 months before figuring out it was my gallbladder. The first couple of days of recovery were honestly quite painful. The incisions (surgery was laparoscopic) were inflamed so moving at all hurt. Though after that I felt significantly better! I’ve also had my wisdom teeth and tonsils removed and both were easy recoveries. I didn’t know of the Sjögrens at the time so it might be best to discuss it with your doctor to minimize pain from inflammation. Otherwise past a few days I felt normal. Best of luck with your surgery!!
I did well with my surgery but been having stomach and bowel issues ever since.
"Had 2 foot surgeries since my diagnosis. Everything was fine. Sometimes there is some concern with anesthesia but it was all fine for me. I advise meal prepping beforehand, drinking tons of water, sorting your meds into a weekly or monthly pill box so you remember to take them (and know if you already took them) and sleeping a lot!"
You mentioned getting thrush.  Is this common with sjogrens ?
Thank you
Oh wow I hope I don’t feel that after. I already feel that now. 😫
I had digestive issues for about 6 months after my surgery. Nothing close to how bad it was with my gallbladder still in though.

I still have to kind of watch what I eat - fatty foods like pork in particular will make me pretty nauseated - but I couldn’t even eat a banana without having a full on multi-hour gallbladder attack before so mostly I’m pleased with the results of the surgery.
"That's also where your jaw is at. There's a joint there that can get off track or inflamed. My jaw has a weird shape and I can dislocate it at will (and open my mouth kinda like a snake 😬), but it also can get stuck and it's incredibly painful. Might be worth looking at."

Other than that you might want to look at something like a meal replacement shake to keep him going. I like Keto Chow but there are others like Soylent.

"Things that don't require chewing but more like ""mooshing"" can also work. Mashed potatoes, ice cream, yogurt, etc. Try mixing in some protein powder and running some extra veggies through a blender."

Consider getting a second opinion somewhere. I really think a dentist might be able to help - even though it could be the gland the dentist should be at least somewhat familiar with it. Many dentists have Groupons for extremely thorough exams and x Ray's. This can help you if you find it's not teeth/jaws when you go back to your doctor.

"Is he on Sjogren's medications? Or has he been diagnosed? I would also pursue that. Plaquenil isn't a cure all but it has helped my symptoms some. Also, drink WAY more water. I have a Big Gulp cup from 7-11 that I'm pretty sure my head would fit in completely and I try to drink at least one of those a day, bare minimum. Also add electrolytes to it. I like lite salt (salt and potassium) but Gatorade powder is also good if you don't care about sugar."
"The other commenter left a very thorough message but I'll add my two cents as well. My Sjogren's diagnosis began EXACTLY like what you've described. My first noticeable symptom was when I tried to eat a peanut butter sandwich for lunch one day and one of my parotid glands swelled up to baseball sized and was excruciatingly painful. Rushed to urgent care and was put on antibiotics for an ""ear infection."" When it continued to randomly happen, I visited an ENT, dentist, etc etc. CT scan was normal other than slightly swollen lymph nodes.. No salivary stones on dental x-rays or the CT.  I had to ask to be tested for Sjogren's because I started to connect other symptoms I had previously passed off as normal."

&#x200B;

"My point is, if you suspect Sjogren's, he may have to explicitly ask a GP to test him for it. In the meantime, you said he's tried the massages. What about warm compresses? Those help me when I am swollen and in pain. You said sour candies were a no-go (and they were for me too when I was really swollen- way too painful), but has he tried a more mild chewing gum? Also an NSAID might help bring down some inflammation. I'm sure he's probably tried all this but thought I'd throw it out there just in case."
"Get him a full rheumatology panel, and if it doesn't show up in the bloodwork, ask for the lip biopsy. I have tmjd and thought that was causing my pain. I now think it's more likely to be the glands. Best wishes!"
"I had the swollen nodes off and on for years. First I thought it was my impacted wisdom tooth, I remember eating at the mall and it swelled so bad, like I had a golf ball on the side of my mouth. Once all my wisdom teeth removed, the swelling would randomly continue but id usually end up feeling under the weather a day or two later. Asked my dentist about it and they said wasnt a problem with my mouth."

"I ended up ""dealing with it"" for close to 10 years because ibprofen would knock out the swelling."

"February of this year went to my regular doctor for joint pain and wrist numbness. He ran some general blood tests, thought I may have RA. Then sent me a referral for a rheumatologist."

From what my rheumatologist told me is that sjogrens is hard to diagnosis because it can mimick other autoimmune diseases. I brought sjogrens up in my second appointment because I googled about my swollen glands and my blood tests were positive for sjogrens.

"9/10 sjogrens patients are women, so the chances of a male having it is rare. Definitely something to ask to test for."
"I also have t1d (and now 4+ other autoimmune disorders). Nearly two decades before my Sjögren's Syndrome diagnosis, my problems began with a painful lump under my ear. I spent the next 17 years seeking the cause. Even after diagnosis, no one put two and two together, until I took a good look inside my mouth and noticed that the parotid had become severely mangled over time."

"My point, though, is that l think that you are on the right track. I'd ask for an ultrasound, if he hasn't had one already. A rheumatologist specializing in Sjögren's Syndrome should be able to do it right in the office. A round of prednisone might be helpful, as well."
I had really super painful parotid glands long before the dry eyes and other symptoms showed up.

I had to ask/beg my GP to send me to a rheumatologist. I thought I had Sjogren's but he wasn't convinced.

"The rheumy thought I didn't have Sjogren's either, even though I had the typical blood markers, because I am male and no family members with autoimmune disorders."

"She ordered a lip biopsy test and that was pretty definitive. Btw, the salivary gland pain subsided gradually over a long period of time ... so there's some hope this discomfort won't last forever for your hubby. If it is Sjogren's there will be more symptoms, unfortunately."
"The chewing isn't the problem. As soon as he starts thinking about food, he has pain. It's definitely a salivary issue. No diagnosis yet, which is why I'm asking how to proceed. Can a primary care physician diagnose this?"
"I second the warm compresses as well.  I also am a male with recently diagnosed Sjogren's.  As the disease was developing, I had a lot of pain in different regions around the jaw.  I found that warm compresses (microwaved bean bag) were the best option to relieve pain around the salivary glands.  I had pretty good pain daily for about 4-6 weeks earlier this year and the compresses were the only thing that helped.   Fortunately they just stopped hurting one day on their own.   I also had pain from the lymph node immediately in front of the ear (the preauricular node - it drains the eye and temple region).   I never did find anything to ease the pain from that - but it eventually did stop on its own as well."
"It's not rare for dudes to have it. Less common than females, yes, but not rare. Statistics say that men make up 20% of the cases, so one in five."
"I'm not sure, I was diagnosed with Sjogren's by a rheumatologist."

A good PCP may be able to if they run the labs and/or order a lip biopsy (that part is usually done by a specialist). My Hashimoto's was diagnosed by a PCP.

ACT lozenges and Biotene products have helped me when my saliva is low.
My PCP diagnosed my Sjogren's from a blood test. Found it on a fluke. Was doing a new doctor set up. Followed up with a rhuemy. After many years found out I have Secondary Sjogren's.
Usually a rheumatologist.
I have had bouts of it in past. What my DR did was give me ozone gas injection near the bladder. It always works for me. I don’t think this is available in all states in US and i had it done in South America. Not sure why it works but they use ozone for a lot of inflammatory conditions bc it’s cheap and effective. I’d want a really good dr doing it though.
I have it with my flares. I'll take pyridium to numb up the urinary tract.
"yes, my doc says it's directly related to Sjogren's. I take the pyridium to numb as well. I had a urologist do a scope and he said it's pretty bad."
"Yes. And actually, I had IC many, many years before my Sjorens started. I missed so much high school due to horrible UTI burning before, during, and after urination. It creeps back up on occasion, if I am stressed, sick, or have my period."
"I have been diagnosed with IC and suspect Sjogrens. So yeah, since they’re both inflammatory it would make sense. I took desert harvest aloe Vera for the IC and it helps."
"Cystitis is a common urinary tract infectious disease. The most typical symptoms of cystitis are frequent urination, urgency, pain in urine, and even urgent incontinence, with hematuria and pyuria. Diuretic and anti-inflammatory pills can be used to treat cystitis. At the same time, avoid irritating, spicy food, do not drink carbonated drinks and caffeinated drinks."
"Exactly the same. After 5yrs of ic, I developed these other symptoms...dryness and fatigue. Do you get fatigue and crashing if you overdo, and increased heart rate?"
I don’t get an increased heart rate from what I’m aware of.
Fatigue and crashing?
Hard to find.  Many doctors are dismissive.   Ophthalmologist offices are probably best bet.  Will need to call around.
Neruo-ophthalmologist can be better.
"I actually heard about it from my corneal specialist! Edit: USA, WA. 🙂. Also my PCP said autoimmune issues are hardly understood and doctors are just grasping at straws. So that’s comforting haha. Good luck in your diagnosis! ❤️"
"Might I suggest you look at the following websites for more information: the USA Sjogren's Foundation website Sjogren's.org and sjogrensadvocate.com. The latter is created by a doctor with Sjogren's, and explains many people are seronegative, but have all the symptoms and diagnosis is based on symptomology and experience of the doctor rather than blood tests alone. Note: Read the ""Sjogren's--Another Look"" section first."

"Also, you don't need to be a US citizen to be a member of Smartpatients.com (free). It is a great community of caring, knowledgeable individuals (including the MD that is building the Sjogrens Advocate website--Dr. Sarah Schafer, M.D.). There was a post about the test you mentioned about 2-3 months ago and why it is not found on B&L's website."

Hope this helps a bit in answering your questions.
I have never heard of it but I'm so early in that testing journey to see if I actually have it or not. I'm definitely going to look into it!
Follow-up question: I registered on patientslikeme.com but I can seem to find the Sjö test mentioned anywhere. Is it possible for you to provide a link to this thread? Thanks in advance
"Thank you so much for the reply! I'm from Europe, so all I could probably do is some sort of walk-in clinic next time I'm in the US for work. I checked all the online lab tests but the Sjö one wasn't mentioned anywhere."
"Also, I think doctors over here haven't even heard of those biomarkers and I mean since when has this test been around? Any idea why it's not properly marketed?"
"My Opthamologist, who treats many Sjogrens patients, is the one who gave the test to me. A friend of his was one of the scientist inventors behind it. My Rheumatologist said the test isn’t widely accepted but she found the results very interesting."
"Great, I'll look into that! Much appreciated!"
It seems (so far anyway) like a lot of docs here aren't well versed either. So you may find it challenging to do that. I hope not because having information is always a good thing. I just know it's been like pulling teeth to get much.
"i get them a lot! i thought they happened due to the friction that happens in the mouth, though."
"I don't know if they're mucoceles but I do get little sores in my mouth every once in a while. I determined that harsher toothpastes always give me sores in my mouth. I think it's some ingredient in the toothpaste that sticks around, that someone who produces more saliva would more easily get rid of. Or my skin is sensitive, or something?"

"Anyway, I switched to kid's SLS free toothpaste (or regular kid's toothpaste if I can't find SLS free) which has helped prevent most of the sores. I used to get them several times a month and now I only get 1 every 6 months or so."
I get these and I also get tonsil stones when my mouth gets really dry 😔 it sucks!!! The best way I’ve been able to get rid of them is gargling salt water and using a saline spray for my nose.
"I get them often even before I got Sjogren's. I don't think it increased because of it. The biggest culprit for me, is not brushing your teeth or cleaning your mouth well."
"Mouth sores are a common symptom of lupus. Since sjogrens can often be secondary disease to lupus, have you checked/spoken to your dr about this?"
"I get tonsil stones. so. nasty. i got them more as a kid than i do now, but they're still awful."
"I spoke to her back when she diagnosed me with Sjogren's and she mentioned this. But then she said ""I would give you the same exact medications for Lupus (hydroxychloroquine) so I don't see the point of further testing""."

I live in an area with a serious shortage of rheumys so I've been putting off trying again. But I do worry about this as I also get the butterfly rash when I'm very fatigued.
The worst right!!! I get them once in a while. I literally coughed one out in the middle of the night last week. So gross.
"Honestly, I highly recommend you taking the plaquenil if you aren’t already. It’s slow acting but after 4 months on it, I am now seeing a difference. There’s also a medication called salagen, that helps increase your saliva, this may help you? It is a bit expensive though so if you don’t have insurance it may not be an option."

"If you’re not medication to treat your sjogrens or potential lupus, the disease may flare and begin to effect other organs, so try not to wait as this disease is progressive if left untreated."

And stay away from the sun!!

All the best!!
Absolutely. The. Worst.
"Yeah, I've been on Plaquenil for about 2 years. It definitely does help."

"I had a Cevimelene prescription (may be the same thing as Salagen) but yeah, my insurance wasn't as good when it was prescribed so I didn't get it. I should look into getting it, though, my teeth need it."

No worries on the sun...I hate it. LOL
Sigh. Let me know if you ever find anything else that works lol
"I’ve never felt that kind of numbness, but I *have* had some numbness associated with Reynaud’s. Does your finger feel cold or wet?"
"I thought I was the only one!  My pinky goes numb all the time.   That's usually the first sign for me that I'm overdoing it.  I know when my pinky goes numb that I need to rest.  Instead of asking me how I'm doing, my husband will say ""hey.  How's the pinky?"" ☺  I'm sorry but I don't have any helpful advice.   I usually just wait it out for a day or two and it goes away.  Good luck!  I hope you feel better soon."
Yes I have numbness usually in a couple fingers. Prob neuropathy caused by sjogrens can be confirmed with skin biopsy test
"All y'all with the pinky numbness, you need to get tested for neuropathy if you don't already have a diagnosis. And be aware of mast cell activation syndrome if you have small fiber neuropathy (SFN). We Sjogren's patients often get SFN and the resultant autonomic dysfunction."

"This is a condition we patients need to be familiar with because, sadly, most of our doctors are not going to be very up on it. Ooops, meant to post this, [here's some info from Johns Hopkins.](https://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/disease-information/sjogrens-syndrome/neurologic-complications/)"
"My fingers get numb and tingly, yes! It seems to happen a day or two after I have had alcohol. Touching things that are cold seems to help when this is happening, it feels like it gives them some relief. It’s ironic because often my hands feel tingly from being cold for too long. Also, drinking plenty of water helps me with this, I don’t know why."
YES!!! super weird huh. It usually happens in my sleep and will wake me up in the middle of the night. not sure what that means exactly if anything
"A bit cold, kind of like how your feet would feel when its chilly.  When water hits my finger it also causes the pins and needles feeling if the water is warm or hot."
thanks for the reply! its comforting to know that someone else out there has experienced this too!
that's adorable <3
thanks for the response.  is there anything that you can do to help relieve it?
I'll up my water intake and see if it helps. Thanks!
Well the best thing is get ur immune system modulated. Ivig is sometimes able to reverse neuropathy and is immune modulator for sjogrens. Palliatively speaking  my neuropathy symptoms decrease greatly taking a high quality b complex which lowers inflammation and is neuroprotective and acupuncture can increase circulation. I also use an infrared heater or sauna it helps.
"How did you do on Plaquenil? Make sure your B12 is above 1000; don't pay attention to the lab range on B12 testing, it's got a terrible false negative rate."
I haven’t started ivig yet also low dose naltrexone is helping diminish neuropathy symptoms
thanks. I will try the sauna tomorrow and I will start searching for A b complex now.
But def get a neurologist to look into it further it could be something else
I'm so sorry to hear about your symptoms. I was diagnosed around 2 months ago and felt the same way you do. Luckily you found this subreddit and from reading and posting my own concerns it's great community!

"The biggest issue for me was stopping and resting when I was having a good day because if I didn't I would pay for it the next few days. It's hard, it's hard to actively tell yourself to slow down when you feel great."

"I hope you have a good rheumatologist whose good at listening and understanding what your symptoms are and listening to your concerns and all about finding the right medication for you, for the short term and long term. But also don't be afraid to speak up, and ask about other options (this and the RA sub are a treasure trove for personal insight). I also really like the sjogrens.org website."

Please free to ask any questions. We're all here to support each other!
"Same!!!! I'm moving and tomorrow is the big day and GUESS WHAT all the effort in packing and cleaning has given me the worst flare up. I feel like I'm dying. My chest hurts, every thing is screaming at me. My nose is all closed up. And silly me packed up everything I need."
Burning could be neuropathy Have a neurologist check u out with QSart and skin biopsy. EMGs miss a lot of neuropathy
Yes !  I’m starting to  make myself rest because I’ve been so used to moving around all the time cleaning   . I’m a stay at home mom so I have to keep myself busy  I didn’t give myself a break but now If i don’t like you said it’s a bad flare up after  .  The dr. I have is very helpful  she response right away when I email her .
My GPs refuse to acknowledge there even is a QSART test (UK) and will do nothing to help me.  The prickling and sometimes sharp and burning pain (now in my back) only gets worse.
Getting better? My 25-year experience with Sjögren's Syndrome is that it's about managing symptoms. I have only gotten worse with no improvement ever.
"I’ll add a more positive comment. plaquenil has been a miracle drug for me, but it took over six months to start working. I also had joint pain and swelling that wasn’t resolved until I started taking the medication."
Have you also been tested for Lyme? I have had both and symptoms are same
I am so sorry i wish i had advice. I am just as lost as you. My symtoms are getting worse too. I am really sorry you're going through this. I tried acupuncture for headaches and it seemed to help. But so far only acupuncture and dry needling has helped. Ive been on plaquenil for 3 months and not getting better.  I sending positive thoughts your way.
"What you just described there has been my life for eight years without getting better at any point, only worse. Obviously there are better days  and worse days, but that continuous headache, fever like feeling, stiff neck etc is with me on most days."

"Obviously we are all different, and your illness will work in other ways than mine, so let’s hope the medication will ease your symptoms eventually."
I'm so sorry to hear that and I appreciate your honesty.
I'm glad it's worked for you! I'm willing to stick with it if will help in the long run. Are you worried about the possibility of the retinal toxicity? I've had a baseline eye exam and everything is fine (with another appointment today).

"Yeah that's what I've read, all this took me by surprise because I was doing better after a couple weeks on it. I went to Vegas and was able to do 90% of what I could usually. Including a lot of walking and standing."

"But a month into the medication I had the new symptoms which I definitely wasn't anticipating. I'm assuming I'm going to have my dose increased, since the usual amount is 400mg."
Thanks for your reply!

I don't think I was since my main complaint was joint pain. Looking back I've had the swollen glands in my jaw for almost 10 years (off and on of course).

"I reside in Phoenix Arizona, so the risk of Lyme is practically non-existent. And my exposure to the woods is quite small, just a few days in Washington and Oregon in January of this year. But I know nothing is out of the realm of possiblity. I'm going to make sure I express all my new symptoms and ask if he thinks there's a possibility I may have something else besides just sjogrens."
Thank you! I finally took ibprofen and that appears to have the most impact. Usually some low dose aspirin got rid of my headache and keeping up on my water intake.

"From what I've read plaquenil can take up to 6 months to have any noticable effect since it's disease moditifying. I'm assuming my dosage will be increased since 200mg is a low dosage for anybody. Though I'm going to make sure I express all the issues I've been having at my appointment, it just scared me how this has gone from 0 to 60 in symptoms and requirement to change my lifestyle."

I'll definitely look into acupuncture if these headaches don't resolve themselves.
"Retinal toxicity is so, so rare that my rheumatologist who had been practicing over thirty years had never seen a case. Do your eye exams and you’ll be fine!"
"Plaquenil dosage is based on weight, so 200 mg is appropriate for some people. Depending on how much you weigh, your doctor might determine you have leeway to increase your dose. Also, hopefully your doctor told you to go to the ophthalmologist before or soon after starting plaquenil to get baseline test, and thereafter go at least annually for monitoring for plaquenil toxicity."
It took about 6 months the of 200mg plaquenil twice daily before I had an improvement but it was like night and day difference! Did they give you an nsaid ? I get more relief from a combo of Tylenol and ibuprofen than the rx diclofenac nsaid I was prescribed

I'm 195 so I know I'm definitely going to probably need an increased dose. And my rheumatologist and his nurse made sure to express me needing to see an opthalmologist before my next appointment for a baseline.

"I had my first appointment with one about 5 days after I started the medication. And I'm seeing him again today, I already have poor eyesight so i want to save what I have!"
Thank you for your reply!

He didn't give me any nsaid since my symptoms were mild in my opinion. Though now that I've had more harsher issues Im definitely going to ask about nsaid RX to use while waiting for plaquenil to kick in.

"I'm in this for the long haul and I'm waiting for the plaquenil to do it's job, but definitely need something in the mean time."

I took Tylenol and ibuprofen this morning and it's made the pain manageable. Still hurting but I can do what I need to now.

"Yoga has been a huge help for me. One thing that I especially love about it is that I can just do a pose or two if I'm waiting for something (like while I'm cooking) or if I'm feeling a bit stiff. Otherwise, I like doing power yoga sets I find streaming if I'm feeling up to a whole session. Those get my heart rate up a little and make me sweat a bit without being too much."
"I haven’t really being diagnosed either, the test SSB was positive and some others I can’t remember right now, the doctor is supposed to call me and explain them to me but still waiting. I have been having a flare that seems like it’s never going to end. I’m itchy all over and at first they thought it was dermatomyositis but now it might be something else, meanwhile I am in so much pain, the stiffness and swelling this morning was crucial. I could barely get dressed. But I keep pushing forward, it is very hard to say that you’re doing okay because I feel like I’m constantly lying.  I hope we can find and answer and I hope yoga helps you bravery it does help me a lot"
I always forget about yoga! Thanks!
^ I agree. Yoga is fantastic. I've done a few series on Amazon prime video that were wonderful :)
"seconded. yoga saved me after my diagnosis. plus most led practices end with ""savasana"" or corpse pose - you just lie down and relax :) check out yoga with adriene on youtube if you're unsure about classes in your area"
"Also in early Sjögren’s the tests can be negative and may take many years to turn positive. So I wouldn’t say you *don’t have it*, just you don’t have positive antibodies right now."
"I'd still look into the autoimmune diet or dietary insensitivity, allergies."
You can try the early Sjögren‘s test Sjö. My other bloodwork was normal.
I'm in Scotland & our local NHS hospital diagnosed me after a blood test & a consultation with a rheumatologist. A lip biopsy has never been discussed.
"A good ophthalmologist can test your eyes with special drops and a special light. Then they can see how fast your eyes produce moisture. They use to do a paper test, but this new way is easier on you and more reliable than the paper."
Sorry no. The NHS is amazing but you don't get a long enough consultation to discuss everything.
Thanks for the info. Can you tell me more about it? How did you happen to do this test? Which doctor prescribed it?
I read online the lip biopsy is controversial among doctors. Do you know which markers were concluant for the diagnosis in your case?
"I already did the Schirmer paper test, it was a clear 0. The ophtalmologist got excited and did a lot more exams to show to his interns what meibomian glands atrophy looks like. They diagnosed me with a chronical meibomitis caused by sicca. I also got cycles of kerato-conjunctivitus, but I didn’t have it when they tested me. They said my eyes were in a way better state than what they expected (because of the Schirmer test) and I should keep caring for my eyes."

"I was told to go see an neuro-ophtalmologist because my vision is very blurry and composed of very little dots like pixels (permanent visual snow, can’t see anything at night, everything is covered by the white dots). I also have flashes of black lines and big colour circles. Sometimes I can’t read anything, it’s like my eyes are moving on their own and I can’t focus them on words. My eyes also hurt behind and when I move them too fast."

"The ophtalmologist has no explication, so he thinks the problem lies with the way the vision message is translated by the brain (I’m short-sighted, at first I thought my eyes had worsen so I tested all kind of glasses correction and the weird eye stuff happened because I am always tired)."
My Rheumatologist ordered it. There’s details in this paper about it https://ard.bmj.com/content/75/Suppl_2/557.1
Thanks I’ll look into it and show it to the internist :)
I didn’t do it because my test results and symptoms diagnosed me. My rheumatologist obviously pushed me to have it done but I refused. Not worth the risk for me.
It was the only way to prove my diagnosis (and possibly explain my small fiber neuropathy). My bloodwork has always been normal for inflammation markers.

"That part of my lip is still numb and its been like 4 years.😔 Its not bothersome, but its weird and seems permanent. I think it was worth it, but a definitive diagnosis doesn't necessarily mean you will get treatment that will be effective."

"That'd be my decision point - there's so little they can do for Sjorgren's, unless the biopsy is standing between you and treatment you, or your doctors, think will really help, its probably not worth it."

Edit: mine was done by an ENT (technically an ENT resident at a university hospital - not sure if experience really matters)
"I went to a dermatologist, and honestly, they didn’t really warn me about any scarring. They said it was a simple and quick procedure... and it was. 2 stitches, which I pulled out myself a week later (work in healthcare and was comfortable doing this - otherwise I would’ve gone back in for it). I had a bump from the time of the procedure until about 2 weeks later, and nothing since then. I’m happy I got it done because my blood work was negative despite my symptoms, and after finding it positive, my pulmonologist sent me for a bronch, which helped them find inflammation that had spread to my lungs."
"My antibody tests were negative, so my neurologist referred me to a plastic surgeon for my lip biopsy. The only weird part was when the surgeon showed the medical students shadowing him a nerve inside my lip. I had a lump where they sutured the biopsy site for months, it seemed, until one day I noticed it was no longer there. I had no complications at all, short term or long term, and wouldn't have been diagnosed with Sjogren's without it."

"Maybe it does matter who does it: I was completely satisfied with the plastic surgeon who performed mine. He is also a teacher at my local medical school, so I had no qualms about his qualifications."

I hope this helps.
"So I did it because I was ANA positive but in a strange pattern, so they had trouble differentiating which connective tissue disease I had. The procedure itself was fast and easy- the Novocain needle is painful but the extraction of the glands itself is painless. That being said, it hurt like hell for the next 2-3 days. If you get it done, DEFINITELY take some Advil or Tylenol (at least) before the local anesthetic wears off to get on top of the pain. My lip was super swollen for 3 or so days, but after that it started to heal remarkably fast. There is some numbness in a small spot directly above the biopsy site on my lip, but it’s not intensely noticeable. I didn’t enjoy the experience but it was worth it for me to get a more definitive diagnosis (it led to my Sjögren’s diagnosis)."
"THANK YOU so much everyone, you have been so generous! I am so glad I asked this group—your replies are immensely helpful and reassuring. It seems my problem is with the ENT and not the procedure."
I did mine in January and I can't say I had the best time. The whole procedure went quickly but I had a migraine immediately after and healing took longer than I expected. It was very uncomfortable to eat the first few days. Make sure you can take the day off for the day after to be on the safe side. I still have a slight bump on the inside and very slight numbness. Otherwise I'm all good.
"I had to get one done, it was the only way to be diagnosed since my blood tests never showed anything. It was this young doctor who did it for me. The procedure itself was little and fast. My lip was swollen few days and partly numb for about half a year but not in a disturbing way. After that it has been completely normal. I think it’s an easy procedure and I recommend it if you can’t get diagnosed solely based on blood tests."
"I did it, and it’s not a big deal. I don’t have a big scar and I can’t say it was painful. It did conclude that I had Sjögren’s syndrome in addition to Lupus. It can only serve to help in your treatment. Don’t be afraid, it’s really not as scary as it sounds. Best wishes for your health."
I tested can’t remember my results as it’s been several years but I do know my ANA was positive.
I had my lip biopsy introduce and confirm Sjögren’s on the spot. No problems at all with the procedure itself.
"I had my lip biopsy as a teenager. It was numb immediately followed the surgery, which continued for about 3-6 months afterward. It completely disappeared 6-12 months afterward."

"Honestly, I had no negative side effects. I took care of my lip as my doctor instructions, and I had a good surgeon. Since my schirmer’s test wasn’t definitive, it was the only way to properly diagnose me."
I was scared of this as well. My Neurologist sent meta a Plastic surgeon  and I didn't even feel the injection to numb it up. There was zero pain after and I didn't even take Advil. My advise. see a plastic surgeon. I have no nerve damage or numbness either.
"I had positive ANAs but we did the lip biopsy to try to narrow down what it was. I had an ENT do it, it wasn't painful (they used numbing stuff). You could kind of feel a slight tugging sensation but no pain. I had to eat soft food for a few days but it healed VERY quickly - less than 2 weeks. The stitches sort of dissolved/fell out within a few days if I remember right, but I did pick out a few pieces where the stitched part had dissolved but the part sticking up hadn't. No bad side effects at all, in fact if you look for the scar inside my lip you can't even see it. No residual numbness or pain or anything."
"I also didn’t do it. I already knew about having RA, but based on my other symptoms, as well as my eye doctor telling me prior to diagnosis that he knew something was really off."

"I have enough icky stuff done to me already, I can live without a lip biopsy."
My ENT did mine 3 months ago. I have a scar that is slowly going away. It doesn't bother me if it never does since I can barely see it or feel it. No numbness although it took 2 weeks for me to heal.
"I had the biopsy a few years ago without any complications.No scarring or numbness. But i have to say that my test results, sonography results of my salivary glands and all in all sympompts diagnosed me.So the biopsy wasnt necessary at all. :D"
It’s not bad. The numbing really is the worst part. And I had all my stitches come out the next day. So it’s no big deal.

"PS. My doctor looked at my no stitches wound and was like “just don’t stick your tongue in it, rinse your mouth after eating, call me if there’s pus coming out. “"

It looked gross for a while but after about 4 weeks I couldn’t tell I’d had anything done.
"This is very heartening. What tests did you get? I have tested positive for several of the antibodies for early Sjögren’s and have many of the symptoms, but my ANA, SSA and SSB are negative. I’m wondering if I can be diagnosed without a lip biopsy."
Mine was done by an ENT and was the only way to get a diagnosis. My lip is still numb 2 years later and I guess always will be. When my mouth is particularly dry I notice it more.  I’d try the plastic surgeon option if possible.
I was diagnosed by a rheumatologist at Mayo via an Ultrasound less than 4 months ago. My daughter was diagnosed via a lip biopsy at Mayo about 3 years ago. She did not have any negative reactions to the biopsy.
"My lip biopsy was inconclusive, but I asked to be referred to an ophthalmologist for a tear stain test, which is another way to get a diagnosis."

"When the doc took one look at my eyes, he diagnosed me with Sjogren’s on the spot. I also have “non-AIDS-related” cataracts, which is to say I’m too young for the eye damage I had. The damage, of course, is from not being able to be proactive about my Sjogren’s condition...because nobody wanted to diagnose me for 20 years. Sigh."

"The lip biopsy is a painful, unnecessary test."

"If the eye exam doesn’t work, there’s also a saliva test they can run to show the same antibodies or markers as the biopsy."

"Ask your primary for a less painful test. That being said, my ENT performed mine with local anesthesia in his office. It wasn’t the worst test, but it did leave a small scar. And it was inconclusive. So, if you can go a different route first, take it."

The Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation has info on their site. They are also in Twitter @SjogrensOrg

Good luck. Don’t let doctors ignore your symptoms.
Thank you so much! I’m sorry it took you so long to get diagnosed.

"I do worry about pain and healing especially because my body hasn’t been healing as well since my symptoms got worse. Also from a totally vain standpoint, my lips are one of the only physical features about me that is attractive so I’d like to not have a scar or anything."

"The biopsy really does seem like an unnecessary test to me. I know my rheum can do a bunch of additional tests like a salivary gland ultrasound, salivary flow, eye tests etc. I will definitely ask for those first but didn’t know if they were enough to get diagnosed."
"High intensity workouts really stress my body out and send me into flareups fast. Whatever you do, start slow."
"Swimming (water aerobics and water yoga, actually) helps me a lot.  I go to a local indoor warm water pool, and sometimes I'll just sit in the water for a bit after class.  I also like land yoga, but I practice at home with Youtube sessions rather than in a class so I can go at my own pace."
"I am an athlete, but i have had to cut down a lot but what helps is just taking it one day at a time and making adjustments."

Working out and being active again after I had my most major and scary flare up a couple years ago actually really helped me keep things at bay. I would always have special mouth spray and eye drops for when i was playing soccer and keep a bottle of water near my sideline position.

"Helps my depression and stress management, stronger joints and muscles, less brain fog."

"Hydrate constantly and take in electrolytes for dry mouth stuff. Ice, rest, stretching, foam rolling and mixing in low impact workout days like yoga or walking or swimming and amino acids to help with inflammation and pain management. Make time for power naps for the fatigue crashes, listen to your body and start slow and with the fundamentals."


"Don't really do great with cardio, not sure why. Really taxes me and does more harm then help, I think, at least in the short term. Love yoga, walking/hiking, and I can get my heart rate up doing those. What big certification are you attempting?"
Hi! I have sjogrens & rheumatoid arthritis—
"Before my diagnosis I had a few years of being a gym rat. My diagnosis isn’t what ended that, so no worries."

"Currently I do a lot of yoga, stretching, and foam rolling. It helps with the pain from both conditions. Granted I do not have joint deterioration from the RA, we caught it early."
"I have always swam laps, and weight lifted while with this diagnosis though not as intensely as my gym rat days."

As long as you are using good form and practice in what you do and not pushing your body past it’s limits you should be fine. I would focus on the areas with the most aches. For me that’s a lot of knees (low impact preferred) and shoulders.
"There's a study running about exercise as a treatment ... Haven't looked at it in a while, though."


Exercise does me good. Especially lots of good long walks. I feel happy after a nice walk!
"Like a few people have said here, I’ll echo that intense cardio kills me. I get light-headed, have trouble breathing, and have some joint issues if I run much further than 5 k. I used to backpack a lot, too, but I got scared after an intense day that ended with fever-like symptoms that eventually went away after 15 hours of sleep straight. Now I try not to do more than 10 miles a day when backpacking. There’s definitely a point where symptoms flare if I push myself too hard in the cardio department, so be careful!"

"I do weightlift, however, with mostly no issues. Sometimes the fingers swell, but I do lighter weights if I’m having a rough month."
"Pilates has hugely helped. I find it easier than yoga, since you spend a lot of time on the reformer, and the gravity free exercise allows me to work out longer, harder, with less pain. My rheum actually recommended it and I'm so glad I took the advice. I got 3-5x a week, just to give you an idea, and for years prior to pilates I could barely work out at all because the backlash was so great."
I’m trying to be certified in Irish Dance. I was thinking of yoga to offset the days where I’m doing intense bouts of pounding there. I’m necessarily trying to be competitive so I’m hoping I can get myself to a point where the all day test is manageable. Luckily my sister is also a dancer and will be opening our school together so she’ll be our long term physical person.
I have been Irish Dancing since I was 8 and I have always wanted to get certified to teach. It’s sort of like passing the bar for us. A lot of people don’t pass. There is a large fitness portion along with the written that I have been prepared for for a bit.
"May I ask...how long ago were you diagnosed with Sjogrens, or how long ago did you notice symptoms?"
"My bloodwork suggests I have Sjogrens, but otherwise none of the classic symptoms. Super active with cardio, HIIT and strength training. Wondering if I can anticipate symptoms suddenly hitting me like a ton of bricks, or if continually exercising might help stave them off."
"Awesome! Best of luck to you. Irish dance is a really spectacular tradition, i love watching performances."
"I'm excited to hear this! My daughter has been doing Irish dance for two years, she wants to be an Irish dancer when she grows up, she'll be happy to hear that there's a certification. I think if you've been doing it all along you should be fine."
I was actually only officially diagnosed last year. I was having progressively worse problems with joint swelling from age 24-30. Doctors were confused and called it migratory polyarthritis and then just told me to treat symptoms when they arose.

"Once the parotid gland started swelling painfully despite no infection, I was sent to the rheumatologist who did the blood test leading me to Plaquenil."

"I guess ultimately, for me, the process of getting sick was gradual. When I think of my youth, I can see how some of my body's ""oddities"" can be explained by Sjogrens, but it was definitely not as severe as it is now."

"I feel quite lucky though in being able to move about and weightlift. Just recently I even hit some personal records in squats! I, too, wonder if I'll be hit with a bag of bricks, but I figure I'll cross the bridge when I get there, and try to live a happy and healthy life in the meantime."
Congrats on those PRs! Thanks for the info.
I have sjorgrens and very dry eyes but I do produce some tears although it almost feels like my moisture gets all used up and I have very sore eyes and headaches from it.  I dread cutting onions.

"But, the production of tears isn't really crying.  In other words, you should still be able to cry, even bawl, just tears won't come. But I would still think you should still get the anxiety relief and so called relief-tiredness from crying even if tear production is minimal or missing."

"Unless you're an actor and tears need to be present, I don't think it should be a problem.  Although, like I had mention, crying, make your dryness feel worse so you prefer to hold back."


"Btw.  Although your condition is chronic, there are things/medicines that can help. Talk to your Dr. or ophthalmologist"
"My opthalmologist told me to gently squeeze the bottom lids to remove the oil gland build up that prevents me from crying. Usually a bright yellow fatty oil will come out (I know, I know, TMI) but I am then able to more easily produce tears. Have you consulted your doctor about doing something like this?"
I had (still do but I have four punctal plugs in my eyes now) dry eyes so severe I had to put gel eye drops atleast four times per hour. But I could still cry normally. I asked about that from my eye doctor and he said it’s totally possible. He gave some explanation but unfortunately I can’t remember it anymore.
"I cry all the time, idk why you wouldn't be able to. You have dry eyes, you aren't an emotionless monster!"
that would bother me too.  i'm still determining if i have sjorgrens.  i have bipolar disorder and i cry a lot.
"I've had Sjogrens for a long time with completely dry eyes (as in no moist what so ever). 2 years ago the tear glands for crying started to get better. First came a few tears from the one eye, then the other and 3 days ago when I got very sad I actually had whole tears rolling down my cheeks. I hadn't thought ever to experience that again. It was really weird to be so crushed and elated at the same time. The other ones that are supposed to keep the eyes moist are still not working but it has given me hope -  maybe one day they will be better too."

"I don't know if it had anything to do with it, but I started to take lutein as a supplement around the same time the changes began. It could just be a coincidence though."
My eyes are very dry but I am still able to cry when very sad. It's just a tear or two tops but usually can manage that.

"I use a lot of ""artificial tears"" eye drops. One thing I've been doing is to help my eye clean stuff out of itself. I use the artificial tears on the inner corner, then lay back and slightly to the side and put drops in until my eye overfills and tears drop out the outer corner. Then just gently wipe the excess. Bonus moisture for my cheeks lol. I try to do this a few times a day, it seems to really help with that itchy dry feeling."

"It's not perfect, but maybe if you're feeling sad you could preemptively overfill your eyes with artificial tears. The action of squishing your eyes up a bit would let more fall out and perhaps that would be cathartic too."
I think you may recover your ability to cry once you find a treatment regimen that fits you. Don't lose hope!
I'm crying right now--with tears ;)

"I understand the feeling of devastation, in all honesty. I'm just trying to take it a day at a time right now :)"

* Hugs*
"The fact that we are at higher risk for things like lymphoma really scare me. About a month ago I woke up with severe pain in my neck, and what felt like some soreness to my ear. I didn’t think anything of it because, well, sometimes always hurts in the morning. I put my hand on my neck to rub it and felt a decent sized lump behind my ear protruding out of my neck. I was so scared. Luckily I was seeing my Rheumatologist two days from that day and he said it was a swollen lymph node. My first thought was lymphoma. It ended up shrinking after about a week. I have constant swollen lymph nodes. I recently was having trouble breathing and when they did a CT scan they noted that I have swollen lymph nodes along my aorta. Pretty scary, but doc said it’s common with Sjogrens. He told me to stay off the internet and don’t look things up. It’s hard not to when you want to know right away what symptoms differ from lymphoma!"
I can understand this. I haven’t been able to smell anything because of Sjogrens for many years now. It’s awful.
My eyes are so dry I tear everytime I walk outside into the cold in the morning.
Thank you. *hugs back*
"Yeah, I realize I'm still technically crying, and maybe it *shouldn't* bother me that I don't produce tears when I do, but it does. It does not have the same emotional release that it used to."

"At this moment, neither my rheumatologist nor my ophthalmologist  have presented any solutions for this, but maybe it's something I can and should press."
"Huh, interesting! No, I have not. When I last met with an ophthalmologist (to rule out physical reasons for decreased tear production), she didn't mention anything like this. Next time I see her I'll mention this (and try it in the meantime), as well as push for other solutions I may not be thinking of. Thank you!"
"Hmm, I wonder if plugs would be helpful for me? It's certainly something to ask about. Thank you!"
"Oh yes, I cry all the time! But not being able to cry real tears has had a real emotional impact on me, in addition to crying being physically painful and/or uncomfortable."
Thanks for your empathy. I hope you get some answers soon.
Oh wow! You’ve given me a shred of hope—thank you for sharing!
Thank you so much for sharing this <3 !
"You know, it’s definitely worth a shot. Thank you."
Thank you!
"This resonates with me SO much. I have pretty severe hypochondriac tendencies as it is and am an expert at catastrophizing spiraling down internet rabbit holes looking up symptoms so knowing about the increased risks of Sjögren’s has been, uh, not great. I am trying very hard to take your doc’s advice to stay off the Internet, but it’s also hard because I want to be informed and proactive. But I totally feel you."
Oh that sounds so awful. I’m so sorry.
I’ve heard that’s what typically happens with dry eyes. I’m sorry. That sounds like a pain. :/
Sorry to hear that it doesn't have the same emotional release.  I know everyone's different.  It just becomes kind of painful for me so I try not to cry.


"And, I'm not sure if there's really medicine for tears so to say.  But there's stuff for severe dry eyes.. drops, restasis, plugs, etc.  that may help.  If you're not having other dry eye problems though they may not want prescribe for just lack of tears."

Hope it gets better or that you find some outlets so that you don't feel the need to cry.  Know that's easier said than done but it may be the best solution... Like yoga or exercise for stress relief.
"Yes, I usually have to clean out my tear ducts every three days or so. It makes a huge difference for me so hopefully this is something you can do"

"Of course, and as you know, wash your hands before nearing your eyes, and be super gentle. The fat should pop right out, and if it's not, then let it rest (think of pimple removal)."

"All the best to you as you meet up with your health team. I had to work with four doctors before I found someone that not only believed me and the symptoms I was experiencing, but got to the root of my issue (15 years of undiagnosed Sjogren's...)"
Well crying isn't really an enjoyable experience... Cathartic yes but it's painful and stressful for everyone. So I wouldn't expect that

Maybe music or art will unlock it for you
"Also, awesome user name!"
"Thanks it sucks, but I’ve pretty much gotten used to it. I started losing it about six years ago and now I can’t smell anything at all. I’m hoping it comes back one day. But I doubt it. Sorry about your situation as well. Sjogrens sucks!"
"More an annoyance than anything, but I appreciate your sympathy. Thank you."

There is often a grief like process accepting a chronic illness. But You are still You.

"If you take the path, this is a portal to become a kinder, more gentle You. Not kinder and more gentle to others, but to You, yourself."

"Maybe you find freedom from some unneeded expectations you may put on yourself, and use that as time to rest and replenish. It's up to you."

"I won't lie, Sjögrens can be devastating - especially if it's neurological (I have that), but you're still here, present and alive in the now."

"I found the book ""When Things Fall Apart"" by Pema Chodron really help instill in me a sense of gratitude, but moreover, optimism, regardless of the state/condition of my health."

"I don't want to proselytize, it's easy to find and easy to read."

PS the last data I read (yesterday) was 5.8% of Sjögrens patients worldwide develop Lymphoma. Don't worry about something that doesn't exist. The stress thinking about it will make you sicker in the here and now.
"When expressing oil with that method, you need to be very careful not to damage the meibomian glands. An easier and safer method is to use heat. I like the Thermalon eye mask which heats up in the microwave for 30 seconds. It makes the oil in the glands warm and ooze out. Then you wipe it away (it also contains debris) with an eyelid cleanser wipe. It's a really soothing and helpful pre-bedtime ritual, and also good when you just need some eye relief. Here's the eye mask, available at some drugstores and Amazon. https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/thermalon-dry-eye-moist-heat-compress/ID=prod6142973-product  I have two because it takes 24 hours to dry after cleaning.

"Haha thank you! I’m finishing my PhD in musicology at the moment and don’t feel like much of a maven any more, but I’m trying!"
I really can’t thank you enough for this thoughtful and compassionate comment. You are a lovely person. 💖
My pleasure. Thank you for reciprocating the warmth.
Hi! I've been diagnosed for a long time now and still don't have too much trouble with dry eyes and dry mouth. Fatigue and pain have changed my life though.

"I will say it's been interesting to notice some things that I didn't realize I did before diagnosis... Having something to drink *at all times*, eye drops in my purse/car/nightstand. I just thought everyone did those things!  Needless to say, those signs were always there but I was self-treating. Thankfully, they haven't gotten worse but the other stuff has."

"The foundation put such focus on dry eyes/dry mouth ""awareness"" that it can be frustrating. Any time I see a new doc and mention SS, they're like “oh, so you have dry eyes and dry mouth?“ Which leads me into an exhausting explanation of how it can be so much more than that for some people."

"Wishing you the best, sorry to hear you've been dealing with pain and hope some of the available treatment options work for you!"
"So I know exactly what panel you're talking about and I was ""diagnosed"" the same way. Here's the thing, none of the specialists can actually agree on if it's legit, and it's definitely not approved for officially diagnosing Sjogrens... Yet. Some say yes these are early antibodies, some say positive results just mean you have something autoimmune going on in your body, but who knows what that could be. I was basically told for my cluster of conditions and comorbidities, I probably have something that has yet to even be discovered that answers it all. Soooo idk there is still a lot of research to be done. If anything the test is helpful in giving your doctor just a bit more evidence to prove a clinical diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder. I hope that made sense and was somewhat helpful..."
"1. No, you do not need dry mouth or eye symptoms to be diagnosed. It's just more common than not."

"2. Just because you don't yet have the symptoms for dry eyes does not mean you do NOT have dry eyes. Have you taken a Schirmer's test? In taking the test, I discovered I had severe dry eyes despite having very little in the way of dry eye symptoms... But the symptoms came later."

Here's the criteria they use for diagnosis:
https://www.sjogrens.org/home/research-programs/healthcare-providers/diagnosis-criteria
I do have dry eye and dry mouth. And the insides of my ears have become maddeningly dry. I am also known for the constant beverage.

Another little bonus is trying to get an IV started. A nurse told me it was like trying to jam a size 7 foot into a size 5 shoe.

"My Sjogren’s diagnoses came on the heels of my RA diagnosis, fun times!"
"I have SS. I have dry mouth, dry eyes, trouble with constipation and dry vagina. I also have swollen parotid glands and sore joints and muscles. I have primary Sjögren’s and RA and Raynauds. My rhuemy says I’m an extreme case. My kidneys are also involved and I have something called Renal Tubular Acidosis. I have trouble with kidney stones. Extreme fatigue is my demon. I get Rituxan Infusions once a quarter and they really help these symptoms to be reduced. I know it sounds awful, but I still manage to have a life. I also always have water in my hand and eye drops in my purse. I’m on Mobic for gastro issues. Potassium for my kidneys, lyrica for the nerve pain and tramadol for the joints. I also take pilocarpine for dry mouth. Things can be managed. There is hope, even if you are an extreme case."
"Thank you so much for your reply! I’m sorry that you’ve been dealing with all of that as well, but thankful that we can get on here to share information."
">put such focus on dry eyes/dry mouth ""awareness"" that it can be frustrating. Any time I see a new doc and mention SS, they're like “oh, so you have dry eyes and dry mouth?“ Which leads me into an exhausting explanation of how it can be so much more than that for some people."

same here! I thought I was maybe diabetic b/c i always had to have a drink never thinking my mouth was dry. DUH!  I thought dry eyes were just hormones but have had joint and neur symptoms for years.
"That’s really helpful to know, thank you! Totally makes sense, in the sense that autoimmune disorders are so ambiguous and still largely unknown!"
"Saliva protects your mouth from the spice. The less saliva you have, the more that spice comes into direct contact with your oral tissues."
"When I flare, spicy food can be really painful."
I used to be able to eat spicy food in my early 20s and now that I have sjogrens I can’t. I’m 33 diagnosed at 32 but symptoms began in my 20s.
Yeah it’s unbearable. I wish I could eat spicy food but my food is soooo sensitive.
Nightshades very often cause issues to those with autoimmune disease. See: the autoimmune protocol diet.
"Undiagnosed at the moment, but i am completely with you this.  I can literally taste the minimum amount of cayenne pepper in the chick fil-a chicken nuggets in a kids's meal.  Too spicy for me.  It's aggravating."
"Yep, can't tolerate spicy food anymore. Also, toothpastes like Crest are a no - go. Have to use Biotene."
Aha moment!! I had a feeling it might be related to the lack of saliva. Thanks!
"I've been lightly researching some diets, like the anti-inflamm diet. But I'll look into this one now. Thanks!"
Thanks all for your responses. Hearing that others also have this problem with spicy food makes me feel less crazy. I always thought it was just me.
It's good to have an explanation
"My mouth is so dry that I can no longer tolerate Biotene. It hurts like hell. Even Xylitol leaves burn marks in my mouth. Saliva is a great protectant. As one of my doctors said, spit is slimy for a reason."
Did you try Evoxac or Salagen (prescription meds for saliva production)? They can be life changing.
"Unfortunately, they had zero effect. Thank you for the suggestion though. It's appreciated."

"I had my saliva flow and volume tested earlier this year. It was zero! Oddly enough, it's been better over the last few months, probably because I manually express one of my parotid glands from the inside of my mouth. A lot of gunk comes out. In Europe, they're testing a method of cleansing those glands."

"Of note, I've had Sjögren's Syndrome for 25 years."
"I take plaquenil, but I understand that it's not for everyone and it took a couple of months for the side effects to go away and I still can't take more then 200 mg."

"Anyway, with Sjogren's you have to switch to products that'll protect the moisture barrier:"

Dry Mouth - switched to a lauryl sulphate free toothpaste

"Dry Eyes - Retain Severe Dry eye drops in single use containers (assuming you're ok with mineral oil).  I love these eye drops, but if you're against using mineral oil find a similar product."

"Dry Skin -Sulphate/Silicone free shampoo, a couple of drops of argan oil on the scalp. Cetaphil lotion or Venicream. Aquaphore. Sunblock."

"Joint Pain -  Borage oil reduces inflammation. Also, I take Aleve, but that's not a natural product."

"Anyone find anything useful for fatigue? I drink a lot of coffee, don't know if anyone found a better solution."
"I'm generally not opposed to medicine, but I turned to natural remedies because I didn't like the idea of going on plaquenil. I had the support of my primary doctor to experiment with food and at this point am gluten free. I also stay away from nightshades and soy. The supplements I use are fish oil, sea buck thorn (great for our sicca symptoms) a multi-vitamin and vitamin D. I also do take at thyroid pill. I like the dry mouth mouthwash at the drugstore. Meditation and exercise also help keeping stress down."

"I found that if you can get your symptoms under control with diet, exercise and meditation, you kind of start to crawl out of it, and good sleep and alleviation of symptoms will follow. Look up ""sleep hygiene."" Epsom salt baths really help with sleep and alleviating stress too. I really don't have flares anymore unless I get stressed out or accidentally ingest gluten, and the stress flares come on gradually so I can usually take the time to keep them from getting too bad."

"I had a bad flare a few years ago around the time I was diagnosed, and I remember just doing 2 minutes on the treadmill at a time, then working up to a walk around the block, and then the neighborhood and then a walk in the woods. It takes time for the inflammation to abate but it's worth it to find your food triggers (AIP is a good elimination diet, and then you slowly add things in to see if you react). You may have to experiment a bit. I also like the sjogren's group on facebook and the facebook group ""Dawn's Path to autoimmune recovery."""

PM me any time.
"I'd be interested in any suggestions too. When it comes to my health though if natural doesn't work I'll take a prescription from my GP. I haven't found anything natural that works here in Scotland. Magnesium tablets seem to help my stomach but they took a couple of months, or it's got better by itself."
"I can’t take regular meds without terrible side effects now, so I turned to food. Some things that helped me: quitting regular toothpaste and other chemical heavy anything, giving up makeup, going on a modified autoimmune paleo diet, chicken bone broth every now and again, taking a probiotic daily (I make kvass) and a natural estrogen cream (I’m 48)."
"Eyes still dry and get the crunchy corners but no more stabby pains or burning, stopped losing eyelashes. Big reduction in biofilm in mouth, I can feel my teeth with my tongue again. No more burning tongue. Skin isn’t as dry, doesn’t hurt as much, acne rosacea cleared up (I also juice turmeric root). My lady plumbing is much improved with regard to pain from dryness. I also eat something wet with every meal (yogurt, fruit, sour cream are all tolerated). It’s a lot of work and I really miss eclairs, but the relief, to me, is worth it."
Humidifier beside the bed helped a ton.
"For fatigue, I drink a home made coffee concentrate and combination of nootropics and supplements, occasionally modafinil. It doesn't control it completely, but it helps a lot. I can get into details if you're interested (not exactly 'natural' by a long shot, although a lot of the stuff I take is found in your body or natural sources)."
"In my experience, you need to take a *lot* of magnesium to get stomach effects, unless its one of the laxative forms"

What form did you try?
"Definitely post what you're using, all of my experiments with nootropics turned me into a raging bitch."
"It's 250mg vegan magnesium from Holland and Barret. It could just be the my symptoms are easing by themselves. I'll keep taking them till the bottle is empty, then reassess."
*DISCLAIMER: I can't guarantee that I'm not a raging bitch :D*

My usual stack consists of:

* cold-press coffee concentrate
* l-theanine
* citicoline
* NALT
* ALCAR
* B12

"(I also take fish oil, vitamin E, and a cheap multivitamin, but those don't matter in terms of fatigue for me)"

"This serves me well most days. I'll take everything but the coffee/l-theanine a second time in the afternoon, if I need it. The ALCAR isn't chiefly for fatigue (it's for my neropathy and autism), but at a high enough dose (2000mg) it gives me a little extra boost."

"Lately, I've been changing things up a bit - citicoline is *awesome* but it's expensive and can be a little speedy for me sometimes. So I switched to taking Alpha-GPC and uridine, and it's been pretty good (citicoline is a choline source which is the main reason why it helps... and it's a uridine prodrug, so in theory Aplha-GPC and uridine are doing the same thing). I've also been experimenting with slow-release caffeine (it's OK for a couple of days, but not as good as a strong cup of coffee)."

"Other things I've tried that have given me a nice alertness or calm-focus feeling, but are either unbearably hard to take, make me too alert, or are expensive (so I usually take them occasionally):"

* phenylparacetam
* sulbutiamine
* magnesium l-threonate
* modafinil

"Of those, I'd recommend trying magnesium l-threonate and modafinil first."

"Other stuff - my battle with fatigue has been taken to new levels of crazy lately since I've started taking tramodol for my neuropathy about a month ago. It makes me super sleepy but totally restless at the same time. So I've been doing my stack *plus* modafinil most days to try to combat it (but I can't take too much modafinil or I feel really ill - so instead of working up to 200mg, I can't take more than 100). I've also been taking piracetam and I think it's affecting the way my body handles tramodol, in a good way. I'd recommend trying piracetam too but I can't speak to its effectiveness WRT fatigue."
Thanks for sharing! L-theanine and caffeine gave me a headache and turned me into a psycho. I'll try the other ones.
"Could you explain more about the ""mental fog""?"
"You can request those medical records so that you can be sure that she's sending you down the right path. It's entirely possible that you received a Sjögren's Syndrome diagnosis as a child, but it seems unlikely given the barriers that people have getting diagnosed as an adult, much less as a child [x] number of years ago."

"That said, your symptoms also don't stand out as someone who has had SS for 10? 20 years? For example, I've had it for two decades. The results of my saliva flow and spit volume tests? ZERO. For your symptoms to have been serious enough to receive diagnosis as a child, but not now... that doesn't add up. (I'm not expressing disbelief in you, but wondering about your mom's recall.) I would definitely request those medical records."

"If you can't do that, ask your physician for two cheap tests: Schirmer's eye test and a saliva flow/spit volume test. They aren't diagnostic, but if your eyes or mouth are very dry, the doctor would be willing to order more conclusive testing."

"To answer your question, I have debilitating cognitive fatigue, word finding difficulties, short term memory loss, and completely unrefreshing sleep... which could account for all of the aforementioned."

"Feel free to hmu with any questions or concerns. I like to help, especially if you need to rile up those doctors to treat your concerns validly. Good luck, OP!"
"Brain fog and fatigue are symptoms of many, many autoimmune diseases so don't worry there.  My biggest symptoms that something was wrong were brain fog, fatigue, and joint pain.  I explained away the brain fog and fatigue (""Oh, I have a stressful job, so of course I'm tired all the time. And I'm getting older, so maybe that's why I can't remember anything and am always having problems concentrating!""), but the joint pain troubled me so much that I decided to have some blood testing done."

"I was only 27, a few months away from 28. There was no reason I needed to be that tired or that mentally fogged.  Getting on Plaquenil and cutting down on sugar helped tremendously with the brain fog, and working in an indoor pool (water yoga and water aerobics) has helped my joints a lot. But the fatigue seems to be something that I'm constantly dealing with, and I just have had to deal with the fact that I don't have as many spoons as a ""normal"" person.  If you've not been introduced to the Spoon theory of chronic illness see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory)."
"Hello, thanks so much for replying -- I'll absolutely bring those two tests up. Seeing how that eye test is done actually jogged my memory, and I'm certain I had it done when I was 4 or 5 years old after seeing someone due to eye pain in sunlight - I think this is where the ""diagnosis"" might've come from."
"Thank you again for the info, I'll keep it in mind moving forward."
"I got so sick a few years ago in the sun. My band played an afternoon show at a festival in the middle of nowhere. I was told to be there 2 hours before the show, of course the person who told me that showed up just before the show, I was a bit pissed. I spent that 2 hours drinking water and sweating and feeling awful; no a/c anywhere in the campsite. We had powerful construction fans onstage, but I felt very out-of-body and was sweating so much my guitar felt like a wet noodle. When we were done I drank over a gallon of water before I could pee again hours later. Man was I sick. Happened in May, the whole rest of the summer I wilted in any amount of heat. Blechh."
I go to the infusion center for weekly IV hydration because I'm almost always dehydrated. I'm so sorry that you had to deal with this.

"Are you okay, OP?"
"Well, my dr has declared the dehydration to be completely unrelated to my Sjögren’s. I’m discouraged and confused."
Yup. Nothing to mess with. Cheers.
"I broke my collar bone in the first fall, but nothing in the two following episodes. My shoulder appears to be drooping, so what happens next remains to be seen. My husband has been more vigilant about my fluid consumption, and making sure I’m ok. Thank you for asking. I don’t know anything about fluid infusion."
Ouch! That sounds very painful. I hope that you make a speedy recovery.

"I have a few other disorders, type 1 diabetes and gastroparesis, that can make it difficult to stay hydrated. So, I go in for ordinary IV fluids (saline). Sometimes, a doctor will write you a standing order for this if dehydration is a frequent issue. It's especially nice if you are prone to nausea or have some other obstacle to drinking enough fluids."
"I’ve recently added IBSD to my list of diagnoses. The heat of summer has made drinking enough a challenge in the past, but I’ll try as long as I can. Thank you for your kind concern. Take good care."
Get the gel for night time. Get the thickest drops for day use and use them continually.  Find an eye doctor who works with sjogren's patients.  This is covered by medical insurance.

"I have permanent plugs in my lower ducts.  Temporary ones can see if they will help.  I also am on restasis 2x day and steroid drops 4x day.  This worked for quite a while.  It has now failed so I am waiting on the delivery of eye drops made from my plasma.  In other words, there are options starting from otc to pretty advanced."

That's the good news.  The bad news is my specialist who prescribed the plasma serum drops said that auto immune dry eyes is the hardest to treat.  But do treat it.  Mine is so bad that I scratched my cornea opening my eyes one morning.  And that's with extensive treatment.
"The only things I've found that consistently work for me are the autoimmune Paleo diet, cevimeline, restasis and rooibos tea (don't ask me why rooibos helps, I have no idea, but I know other ppl with Sjogren's have found it helpful too). Wishing you the best of luck."
"Warm compresses. I haven't figured out a practical way to do it yet, but something like a heating pad wrapped in a wet towel is perfect."
"The best thing for my dry eyes has been consuming healthy fats - particularly fish oil and sea buckthorn - but even fish, advocado, and coconut oil."
Experiment with your eyedrops. Mine are picky and the only one that works when my eyes are freaking out are the preservative free systane ones. It's worth experimenting to see what your eyes tolerate the best. And the ointment is great for night.

"Daily fish oil supplements are great, and it's also important to make sure your ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 is good. Make sure that your daily cooking oil is not high in omega 6. I use canola oil because of the omega 3 content (and because it's cheap) but an oil full of monounsaturated fats like avocado or olive is also a good bet."

"When things get really bad, I put on motorcycle glasses or onion goggles. They have a foam, silicone, or rubber thing around the edge which can really do wonders for keeping the moisture in your eye. I particularly love them for driving, because using the heat in my car can aggravate my eyes otherwise."
"Everyone else has given you great advice. Eye plugs (see an opthamologist), warm compresses to help thin the oils behind the eyelids (to help keep the tears productive), and the AIP diet (autoimmune Paleo) all make a difference."

I was diagnosed while living in Houston. The doctors never gave me the guidance that I've received in the past month when moving to Michigan.

"Oh, and on the Restasis front: I couldn't tolerate it so I do Retaine 2x a day. It's not quite the same thing, but it certainly helps."

Good luck and keep posting here. We all need to help each other.
"Cod liver oil (liquid, not pills) combined with cannabis edibles."


"Adding to this comment, getting the temporary plugs made a world of difference for me and they've stayed in for over a year so far. Just two bottom plugs made things worse because the upper ducts suctioned and overcompensated. Got the tops plugged, too, and it has helped immensely."
"I love my Thermalon dry eye compress. Microwave for 30 seconds and place on eyes. Use eyelid wipes afterwards to get rid of oil and debris that comes out. Available online and at some drugstores, Target or Walmart. http://thermalon.com/  I have two because they take 24 hours to dry when you clean them."
"Yup. Another vote for the Systane drops, here. My optician suggested them to me. The only thing I have to remember is to warm them up to body temp first or it HURTS."
"I have never seen this before, thank you! I even have one of their standard heating pads, never thought to see if they made something like this."
You're welcome! I also have similar booties from a different company. Good for sitting around but to loose and slippery for walking. https://www.riteaid.com/shop/bed-buddy-foot-warmers-blue-2180414?ra_group=gPLA20pct16&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnqzWBRC_ARIsABSMVTOPrK2sTLnOLhWwf280Dt1_77OxQ7huq-DKgIw_6g11rDMu9RMX-GAaAnHVEALw_wcB
I have 20 years of horror doctor stories trying to figure out what the was wrong and then ended up diagnosed with Sjogrens only after I decided to get a second opinion on another diagnosis.

"I was either told it was normal (""dry eyes and dry mouth happen as a person ages""... I was 20 at the time) or that I was being ""overly sensitive"" and that it was all in my head."

"I did have a few who treated my concerns seriously who just had no idea. One even called me at home one evening, apologizing because he just couldn't figure it out, but that he wasn't giving up. It was another 10 years after that doctor to figure it out."

"There are quite a few treatments, but it all depends on what specifically your wife is dealing with. A good dentist should have suggestions regarding mouth care (mine encourages the use of products with xylitol and to stay away from whitening products) and a good optometrist should have good suggestions for eye issues. Rheumatologists will work with the overall treatment of the disease. Don't be afraid to change doctors if the current one just isn't working for her. One of my rheumatologists (the one who diagnosed me) said that Sjogren's ""only causes dry eyes and dry mouth"" so there are clearly some rheumatologists who really don't have a good grasp on the disorder."
Autoimmune diseases (especially the lesser known ones) are a nightmare to diagnose. I got really lucky that I was SUPER sick and was only 23 so they took me seriously. My Sjogrens diagnosis is considered a secondary disease so I only have the dry eyes/dry mouth to contend with. I don't know your wife's age but I would definitely make sure you do research if you end up wanting to have kids. I have the antibodies and there is a high incidence of heart block in the fetus. My daughter ended up having Neonatal Lupus that was caused by the antibodies. Cleared up once she was 6 mo and the antibodies had left her body. Good luck!
Here's a thread with recommendations for helpful items for various symptoms. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?topic=10139.0
"No offiense, because I know a systemic autoimmune disease that causes severe fatique is a difficult issue for the entire family, but getting this kind of autoimmune diagnosis in just  a few months is pretty much the best you can hope for. Many of us went decades before getting diagnosed. Probably half of us can’t get a diagnosis because our antibodies aren’t identified."


"Your experience is not abnormal at all, I’d say the level of bullshit you guys have dealt with is moderate. I had fatigue and crazy sleepyness for about 3 years, but no doctor would pay any attention until my lacrimal glands began to protrude from my eye sockets. Even then, it took a PCP, ObGyn, Ophthalmologist, Ophthalmic surgeon, and Rheumatologist before I got diagnosed."

"Edited to answer the “what now” part of the question: plaquenil has worked pretty good for my fatigue and pain. I recommend resting when needed, definitely don’t overdo it when you aren’t feeling well. At the same time, try to maintain a baseline level of activity even when you feel poorly for a long spell. I’ve let myself rest too much I think and lost some muscle mass, which compounds the fatigue."
"Sorry to hear about all of the problems that you had. I have a family history of Sjogren's and was still treated with some skepticism from my primary care and later the rheumatologist, because I look healthy."

Anyway here's a handy product list I posted here a couple of days ago (deleted a couple things that were specific to the previous post):

"Here's what I do along with plaquinil (btw I live in a dry climate, so this could be overkill for you):"

Dry Mouth - switched to a lauryl sulphate free toothpaste

Dry Eyes - Retain Severe Dry eye drops in single use containers (eye drops with mineral oil).

"Dry Skin - Head and Shoulders dry scalp shampoo (or a sulphate free shampoo), a couple of drops of argan oil on the scalp. Cetaphil instead of soap. I only use soap on my armpits. Cetaphil lotion or Venicream. Aquaphore. Sunblock."

Joint Pain - Aleve & Borage Oil. Borage oil reduces inflammation.

It took me almost 5 years to get a lip biopsy. It came back positive. I am overweight so the response that I got from several Ents was beyond hurtful and discouraging.
I began with huge swelling in neck and face. I had an MRI and tons of blood work done. Every Mri showed all lymph nodes were huge.
"The Drs kept saying mono or virus. Every mono, aids etc test was negative. I was given antibiotics over and over. No one would do a biopsy because I had the node swelling so long so they said it’s not cancer because if it were you would not be here."
I went to Dr after Dr to the point where I swore I would never go to any Dr again. I felt truly helpless. I felt like no one believed that I was so sick and as your wife I was told it was in my head and wanted me to see a therapist.
I honestly felt discriminated against because of weight and the Drs not able to see anything such as a tumor in my throat.
"Then we lost our health insurance. I signed up for Kaiser. I had another really bad flare up so I had to go due to severe swelling in neck, inside mouth and chest. Luckily I was sent to ENT who then referred me to RA specialist. Right away she knew what I had and did biopsy to confirm."
From there I was put on pleniquil and also levathroxine. The pleniquil really helped so much. I still have up and down days but nothing like I was prior to the medication.
It was worth the fight to get a diagnosis as at least now family and friends know what I have and are more understanding. Drs also have treated me better since diagnosed.
"Best advice was eat well, do what you can as far as activities on your better days. When you feel bad or have a flare up rest and regain strength."
The only down side is through Kaiser they refuse any type of meds for joint pain or for inflammation. Only steroids and I have sinus tac so that’s not a good option.
If you don’t have a great Dr keep searching until you find a great match.


* one last thing the first thing we all do when feeling sick or run down is to try to boost the immune system. I was told that’s the worst thing we can do. So don’t run out and buy immune boosting supplements or extreme juicing for immune system.
"I just got back from seeing an auto immune specialist today for the first time.  I’m not going to go all into my symptoms, some are extreme abdominal pain and pancreatic pain on rare flare ups (3 ER visits in three years), some joint pain, chronic migraines, dryness is a lesser issue.  My SSB numbers are 6 times what is normal (2 tests in 2 years).  The  Rheumatologist today said he doesn’t believe I have sjogrens.  Thankfully he prescribed me plaquenil and had me do more labs.  This is just over 4 years after my first “attack” that everyone initially thought was pancreatitis."

So I still don’t have an official diagnosis.  I’ll  see now if the plaquenil helps me at all.

Good luck to us all.
"Oh, that's nothing. I'm still in the process of getting diagnosed, and it's been over a decade."
Pretty much the same thing to the T with me as well
"> One of my rheumatologists (the one who diagnosed me) said that Sjogren's ""only causes dry eyes and dry mouth"" so there are clearly some rheumatologists who really don't have a good grasp on the disorder."

How in the hell do these people have the nerve to contradict obviously engaged patients with the wrong information? What kind of ego allows for that kind of surety in ignorance? So much has changed in autoimmune disease in the past ten years; you'd think there would be a general humility about AI issues rather than reflexive arrogance and dismissiveness.

"I have to tell you, it's infuriating to see how many of us have been made to feel like we're histrionic attention-seekers. It's very destructive to our mental health and ability to cope with a chronic illness. I'd like to see a movement among patients who call out every doctor who implies they are a hypochondriac. That's a very damaging thing to say and requires proving a negative; that the patient has no disorder. It's never spoken of that there is no protocol among general physicians to go from likely to less likely explanations of symptoms. Basically, all they can say is ""I don't see anything, but I've only looked at the tip of the iceberg of possibilities, so I'm going to blame you rather than admit to my own limitations."""


"I wasn't trying to be like, ""Oh woe is me, look what we had to go through.  Please pity us"", when I wrote the story.  I just wanted to report it as it happened.  My wife and I are super glad that she was diagnosed. All of the waiting is behind us."
"Great suggestions. I have a small concern, though. While Aleve has a lower risk of stomach ulceration than ibuprofen, it can still cause problems."
My primary care told me to take Aleve.
"In my experience, MDs aren't infallible"
Be best if you ate something along with it as well as drank a good 8 oz. of water. Every NSAID can cause stomach issues. Everything your doctor prescribes you has serious side effects.
"The other night I got so frustrated because I couldnt hold my arms properly to mix salsa I was making, they felt terribly heavy to me and I couldnt grip the spoon."

"I get those discouraging thoughts to just give up and sink into my bed and perhaps never get up. I have three year old twins that make that impossible. Ive heard that perseverance can do amazing things but damnit if giving up dont sound hella good to me lately.  The sun hates me and sucks all my energy, I get the same bowel issues that my doctor claims has nothing to do with my sjogrens. I get fed up and frustrated and feel  its stealing my life from me completely. Its not like I had some outstanding life before my diagnosis but since started plaquenil my depression/anxiety has become worse... as if I needed any help right? I mutter to myself at least three times a day TO JUST DIG A DAMN HOLE AND CLIMB IN!"

"Theres some dark comfort knowing Im not alone, I hope this lifts for you soon and you get a little relief. XOXO <3"
"Give yourself a break. When I'm down I do stuff but its not much. Maybe more a load of laundry from washer to dryer and that knocks me out. I was really hard on myself and got very depressed. Once I finally said I'm not going to even try when I have no energy, that helped emotionally. Our house is a wreck a lot of the times, but I just stopped caring bc I couldn't. I also stopped caring what other people thought or said. No one knows what you are going through except others going through the same thing! You need to focus on you getting better. Higher energy days will come. You may also want to talk to your doc, when I told her how little energy I had she upped my prescription and it did help."
"I was diagnosed with Sjogrens only yesterday, I too have twins,  age 9. I feel lost. I am experiencing so many different things and it's frightening.  It's also been discovered that I have brain damage that is looking like MS, and I have Hashimotos disease, all are autoimmune it seems, all just found,  I'm 38f."
"All my research shows so many different symptoms, just reading what you are dealing with makes me feel like my symptoms are real,  because you have them too. I thought I was going crazy not being able to stir big pots of spaghetti,  open jars,  go outside (I'm in Arizona and I can't handle the heat these last 2 months). I am so tired and in a fog, the list is endless. I haven't been given any medication yet for this,  is it normal that we all have many symptoms the same and many also different?"
"Yes, it helps just to know I'm not the only one. 3 year old twins, wow! I hope something helps and I hope you keep going. Stay strong."
"This gave me chills because I still dont have a concrete diagnosis, my blood says sjogrens, my symptoms say Lupus(hair falling out, sun rashes, joint pain, dizziness, fatigue like a brick wall laying on top of me) doc says the gastro issues arent part of sjogrens or Lupus but I have read so much contradictory information from patient forums. Waking up sick, having sick moments throughout the day, Dry heaving.. *so fun* /s fingers locking in painful positions. And ohhh my favorite MIGRAINES. Friends on Patient.info have suggested possible vasculitis. Ive been taking plaquenil for 7 months now and dont feel any difference from before taking meds."

I cant imagine anything getting worse but so tired of not knowing.

"I have a hunch that blood type makes us more susceptible to autoimmune, I have negative blood type and in some reading have found we're more prone to autoimmune disorders. :( Ive been planning on making a post about it."

You know kids are so busy I cant imagine when mine are 9 I hope that I feel better and can do things like be in the sun. Currently the sun gives me horrible rashes on my ears nose cheeks and arms. People say cover up and sunscreen but its primarily heat makes my heart race somethin fierce and dizziness.

Like I said before though is theres comfort in knowing other people have similar unexplained symptoms so we can come together and try to brainstorm what we personally think... sad when you have to scour the internet to make connections while ur rheum sees you once every six months spends ten minutes with you then throws a DX ur way and Ive read many stories of misdiagnosis/changing DX. It bothers me so much my doc wont correlate PMS with my symptoms when MANY MANY women have expressed to me how everything is worse before and during their cycle. Do you also have this?
"I have also had endometriosis since age 11, my blood type is O+. I find that I'm more tired during menses and yes,  symptoms seem worse."
"I teach my children about Sjogrens, my eldest son is almost 17, he helps a lot with chores, lifting things I can't etc. My twins help by staying quiet so I can sleep,  getting me water etc. I find that if they know,  they can understand the symptoms and why mama can't always do things,  they are fantastic about it. An MRI, blood work,  and spinal tap found everything I have,  but I had to fight to get them. The specialists are fast to dismiss symptoms. Don't let them. My last of what Sjogrens, MS, and Hashimotos causes is long."
"Well, you know how we get one autoimmune (AI) dx and then we find others; it's very common. Bowel issues may not be directly caused by Sjogren's (and who knows, maybe they ARE, we are still very early in the understanding of AI disease!), but they could be caused by another AI disease like celiac disease, Crohns or ulcertative colitis. If I were you, I'd insist on a referral to a good gastroenterologist. And remember, if you are getting tested for celiac, you must not go gluten-free until after you are tested."

"If you do find that you do not have celiac antibodies, you can try going gluten-free anyway. No test for celiac disease is 100% accurate."
"Thank you, I will certainly ask my rheum for a referral to gastro and see if I cant find some answers for that, Ive thought for a while maybe part of it is a gluten intolerance."
"Hey, did you ever get your referral to a GI?"
"My wife is same as you. RA runs in her family, the Sjogrens was secondary, but had the more alarming symptoms."
"Same. Get on medication and be very honest with your doctor abt how u feel. Go easy on yourself, u wont have much energy until u get to the correct medication level. If u catch it early and start getting medicated it really isn't too bad, your life will change but the diseases should be manageable. Most important thing is to set the correct expectations for yourself. Don't beat yourself up if u have to cancel plans, can't keep up with housework, and order take put more often than normal. This can go on for a while until you are correctly medicated. Just give yourself a break. At this point, I think I should be able to put RA and SS on my resume bc its like having another job. Look up the spoon theory if u haven't, its true u only have a certain # of spoons each day - use them wisely."
"I'm really bummed. I went in because my hands hurt and the doctor said, ""Uh, that could be because your fingers are all bending the wrong way..."" It really sucks, they initially said Sjogrens, then SS and Lupus, and now it's SS, lupus and RA. This sucks."
My wife also developed alopecia to go along with it. She had a hard time when her hair fell out in half dollar sized chunks.

Also - brittle teeth. :(
"The hair loss is one I am really nervous about. Themed they put me on may accelerate hair loss, and I'm not a vain woman, but I have some gorgeous hair and don't want to lose it. :("
It really hit her esteem hard. She had multiple series of steroid shots over the course of about a year before it grew back.
"Although I have not had any direct experience with hair loss (my sister lost hers during chemo when we were in grade school), maybe if it starts you could shave it all at once and have a wig made of your own gorgeous hair? I have no idea if that is actually possible, but if so, you could have your own hair.  My sister used her hair loss as an excuse to go redhead from blonde.  Having that little bit of fun with such a difficult situation made it more tolerable."

The worst visible symptom I've had to deal with so far is all the weird rashes and vasculitis that I am convinced make everyone who sees me think I have some horrific communicable disease. Makes public swimming and the gym nearly impossible.  I am convinced someone is going to confront me.
"Only Plaquenil helped me with the awful fatigue. I still have bad days, and resting is key to being functional. Mild exercise can help, but don't push yourself or you'll pay for it the next day."
"Me too. I eventually got diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension. So I supplement salt and I'm on florinef. When my potassium/sodium balance is right (which is hard to do for me), I still get extremely fatigued, but its better."

"So, besides the salt (and elevating my feet), what helps:"

- moving around (makes me more fatigued but if I do it enough it's all easier to deal with - I walk maybe 1/4 mile once or twice a day)

"- sitting down when I get tired (aka pacing yourself). Frustrating, but taking breaks makes a difference."

"- modafinil (Provigil). Its an Rx that can help make me feel more alert/awake. Its sort of a miracle drug. However, it doesn't do much for physical fatigue, so if I'm having a really bad day I'll skip it so I can rest."

"- I've been experimenting with some nootropic supplements over the past few months with success, but they have the same affect as the modafinil: better mood, focus, motivation, concentration, but still physically wiped out."

**TL;DR**
"If something like plaquinil doesn't help (it didn't help me 😑), consider looking into POTS/orthostatic hypotension, keep moving, pace yourself, and there are stimulants that can help in some ways, but even if they make you feel great mentally, they will probably not do much for you physically (sometimes the mental boost does help keep you active)."
"Caffeine is the only thing that helps me so far. I literally can't function without it. However, I'm currently not on any treatment, either."
I seem to live in my bed.  Not sure if the fatigue is from the fibro or the Sjogrens.  There seems to be a drug for everything but the Fatigue!  Will this ever end?  Does it ever get better?
How long did it take to help you? I've just been on ir for 12 days.
Got a script for modafinil today...
I wish I could get a central line with caffeine!
"Fatigue is major underlying factor with all auto immune. I also have Sjogrens and Fibromyalgia. Sometimes I can make it from the bed to the couch! Living with it is  3 things for me 1.a healthy diet 2. exercise in small segments like Stretching, 15 min walk maybe three times a day , light weights and stress management.  Even when I don’t feel like doing anything, I do one small thing and then go “yeah me!” I’m the only one who knows I’m a super hero sometimes.  Massage helps and sometimes you’re lucky and have a great day."
It took me about two months to start feeling somewhat normal.
Caffeine and Nuvigil for me.  Nuvigil got me through the rough times and helped me function enough to make it to work until things got better.  Not for everyone though.  Best of luck.
Ha! That would be awesome!
Thank you. I hope it works for me. Otherwise do your symptoms flare and subside?
"Yes. I have mostly good days and sometimes I have short flares. When I do have a flare, I try to slow down considerably, eat well, take cold showers and paracetamol ( I have low grade fevers during my flares). Usually I'm.back on track after a few days."
I hope I can get to that point!
"I know, this disease sucks big time. I'm sorry you have to deal with it too, but if it is any relief, life became much easier once I started meds. Good luck to you :-)"
Thank you so much for your kindness! It is difficult because my friends and family don't seem to understand.
"Nobody does. My husband still thinks that it is just something I whine about and that if I ate more veggies it would go away. I think that because we look healthy, it is hard for people to understand. Just stand your ground and you'll be fine :-)"
"Do a search on fibromyalgia triggerpoints. Compare the chart to your own points. If each of your points is radiating pain more than say 10 of them that's fibromyalgia. I have both and I also have myofascial pain syndrome so I have pain everywhere but trigger point pain is distinct. For me, it feels like hot lava rocks that radiate pain."
Turmeric root juice is great for cutting the pain down (anti inflammatory)
"I have both. SS can cause joint, muscle, and nerve pain. But even if they make the diagnosis, follow up on the fibro diagnosis. Like someone else said, it is very distinct at those trigger points (though mine tend to float)."

"I wish I understood what causes it. I know inflammation is a big factor. LDN has helped me a bit with pain overall (whereas plaquenil and methotrexate did not), but there's nothing that works for everyone... yet :)"

"Good luck, OP!  Rest when you can and take care of yourself!"
"I have both as well, through the SS seems to be worse then the fibro. I see an Md who also practices herbalism, and I'm in an anti inflammatory blend called Zyflamend that helps a lot. I'm also on a fairly anti-inflammatory diet (lower carb, try to cut out most processed foods, lots of veggies and healthy fats)."
"I have SS and MRI scans show Multiple Sclerosis.... ask a neurologist, I have these symptoms,  all of these autoimmune diseases are very very close in what we all experience"
Leaky gut and an immune cascade causes it in a large number of people
I'm not subscribed to anything to become aware of Sjogren's developments and would greatly appreciate you posting new information here! Thank you for offering.
"Yes, please!"
Done! I'll post when anything important comes through.

Awesome. The GoodRx app also helps by finding the cheapest price in the user's area and sometimes offering discount cards.
Thank you for the info OP. My mom has sjogrens and uses plaquenil. I'll let her know to anticipate a possible increase in price.
Thank you for sharing!

Actually this is the off brand.
"I meditate, that seems to help me manage my symptoms. I get better rest at night and wake up not as sore, I've been able to get into a good cycle and now I can exercise, which also helps with the reyanulds/cold/circulation issues. To me, it's something you can do with no investment, and I just lie there at night and first thing in the morning. It also helps me be more patient, I notice my mood is much better."
"Do you have access to counseling? It has really helped me. I feel depression/anxiety start a negative feedback loop with symptoms- the worse I feel physically, then mentally, which I think makes me even more physically ill, etc."

"I don't know what you're able to do, but very light exercise such as yoga can help relieve some stress and gently work on some physical issues. If you check youtube, there are a lot of very simple, gently routines that are made with conditions such as arthritis, or other damage, in mind. This is something that I should do more of because I'm too antsy to meditate, but I get the same kind of relaxation out of yoga."
"Feeling depressed definitely makes my symptoms worse-especially controlling my pain when I'm upset about anything is near impossible.  My doctor-who doesn't take my insurance anyway had forbid me to do my yoga.  I really went from being extremely active to barely at all.  I'm very crafty and love to sew but cannot sit in the same position for more than a few minutes which makes things like that difficult.  Feeling useless or unproductive is the quickest way to get me into a depression.  If I can't go back to work, I'd like to find a place to volunteer but everyone I've talked to wants a commitment to be available a certain set of hours and that makes me unreliable.  I'll have to check what counseling options are available to me through my new insurance."
"Counseling has been really helpful for me, too. While you're looking into options, check into CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy). I've found the support and coaching provided really valuable in helping me accept where I am in the moment and also take better care of myself. Best wishes to you :)"
Welcome. Just posted this on different thread but I guess sharing this makes more sense to you.

I had some success finding information and experiences from those places for my MCTD and Sjögrens syndrome. Haven't yet ordered that dna sequencing from 23andme but would recommend doing it with CFS immeaditly.

http://phoenixrising.me/ http://www.longecity.org/forum/

"Different situation but for me the biggest difference has been different adaptogens and Chinese herbs/mushrooms. would recommend trying out atleast Panax Ginseng, Ashwagandha, Cordyceps, Reishi and Rhodiola Rosea in no particular order."

Also would try out taking a different kind of probiotic-supplement for few weeks depending on how many antibiotics you've eaten lately.

"I was you a few months ago, fed up with the tiredness and inability to think straight or walk straight. Been now 8 months without the old fatigue."

Welcome to /r/sjogrens
"I've been researching health remedies for years. Exercise, supplements, eating healthy, drinking tons more water, etc. Each time I tried something new I hoped that I would finally improve but quite honestly I feel worse than I did when I was a young woman who smoked, drank, barely drank water, ate horribly, and didn't exercise. I will look into your info though and thank-you!"
"I clicked on your link and whoosh right over my head. What exactly am I looking at here? I saw the word ""genetics"" and my heart when pitter pat. You have no idea how much I love to learn anything involving genetics. This looks incredibly interesting. Can you explain a bit to me and should I join this?"
"They are both big forums where people talk about different supplement regimens for autoimmune diseases, physical performance or how to live longer. Both have pretty nice information on what supplements to use on different immune disorders. You can search for information from these forums by google usually, no need to register at first."

For overall pubmed or forum searches you should search on what works on all the different rheumatoid diseases. Usually same stuff that works for rheumatoid arthritis works for Sjögren's too.

For what I've found usefull over the past few months is that you should definetly pay attention to your diet and probly try out Keto-diet. It has helped alot on my overall fatigue and pain levels.

About the genetics. I don't really understand this either that well but your body's way of producing energy and taking care of it's normal function's are usually impaired on autoimmune diseases and even if you have a same diseases than someone else it doesn't mean that your Methylation Cycle has the same problems. Figuring out your genetics might help you to get to the right supplements faster and it might be overall more efficient way to get into a shape that makes you feel like a human again. :)

"If you want to try out those things I would recommend adding 1 thing per week. As for where to find Ashwagandha and things, just get the cheapest from iherb.com."

Hopefully I gave you some usefull information.
"Thank-you so much. My husband does the online ordering and he will only order from amazon. Also we don't have a lot of money. Hopefully I can find some of the things you mentioned cheap there. It's weird that you mentioned the Keto diet. Yesterday I was looking into that and I found it in a completely unrelated way. Weird coincidence. I wish I could do a diet like that. Problem again is money and also I crave sugar as badly as I used to crave nicotine. I literally cannot stop myself from eating sugar at least once a day. I feel horrible when I don't and can't stop thinking about it. I even dream about eating sweets. I limit my sugar intake as best I can. As far as bread pasta etc. there's no problem because I think stuff like that tastes disgusting. Pretty much all I eat is fruit, vegetables, greek yogurt, chicken, and oatmeal. Then of course there's the chocolate food group lol. Feel free to share anything that I should learn. I would love to feel better."
Sorry for the late reply. Managed to write a long one and got it dissapear by clicking from a wrong button. Fun times.

"I don't think there is a miracle pill or a doctor that will guide to you to the right direction. You have to change your life by yourself and try out different things that work for different people. Keto and lifestyle change might be a big thing, ordering few of those herbs that I suggested might be even bigger. All of these different things might not work but you won't be able to find it out if you don't try out. You are the one having to make the change though. There is no one else making it for you. I just wish that someone had said about the alternative choices before to me or that they've would have told me at my rheumatoid clinic that they don't actually have medicine to get my fatigue fade away...or that the fatigue is actually big part of the Sjögren's"

Here is a few links to amazon.com:

These two cost less than 0.10 capsule.

I'm sorry if I sound harsh but English is not my native and in Finland we usually prefer to go to straight to the point. Sorry. edit:

And I'm sorry for you to hear just now different ways to manage your sickness and not 4 years ago...
Thank-you! I will look into ordering some of the things you recommended.  I have always wished I lived in Finland btw.
I have had all the symptoms you are describing. I know it's completely debilitating and I know how you feel. Don't give up hope!

Have you been able to see a rheumatologist? The medications that helped me the most when I was flaring like you are now is Plaquenil and prednisone. My levels of inflammation were very high and my blood complements low. In that respect this disease can be very similar to lupus when it gets aggressive. Once you are on the right medications it just takes time for the inflammation to resolve. Every day will get a little bit better. Give yourself permission to rest.

I'm sorry I'm not in the Baltimore area to recommend a rheumatologist to you. Hopefully someone else has a suggestion.

"I haven't found anything to combat the fatigue yet. I've heard of some people being prescribed Ritlain(?) to help, but I have no idea how that works. I've been able to reduce the joint pain by removing gluten from my diet. SS and Celiac have a weird relationship."
"I hope you find a rheumatologist that understands what you're going through, based on some of your other comments it looks like the one you saw doesn't understand Sjogrens very well at all."

"I go through flares similar to yours.  I do not (to my knowledge, though my doctor has suggested it) live with depression, but I do have generalized and social anxiety disorders, and it seems that when my anxiety symptoms start to act up, so does sjogrens. You can bet that if I have some situation that causes me a high degree of anxiety (or regular old stress, for that matter), I will be hurting pretty badly for the next couple of days.   Maybe you are having a similar situation with depression.  It could be possible that your sjogrens is making you feel depressed (and stressed), which is in turn exacerbating your sjogrens symptoms.  If you are not already getting treatment for depression, it might help to try that concurrently with sjogrens treatment.  As for anti-inflammatories,  I have taken Plaquenil in the past and it helped some but not a lot (I did not stick with it though, and you are supposed to do that so that might just be my fault). Celebrex was very helpful for joint pain, like an absolute life-changer, but the downside is that it is very expensive."

I spent pretty much the entire year last year in a really awful flare. I was not well at all. Towards the end of the year I had some bloodwork done and found that I had a vitamin D deficiency-  this is also something you might want to get checked out.  Vitamin D deficiency can be associated with sjogrens.  Getting my vitamin D level within normal range has made a noticeable difference.

"And I know this is going to be an answer that sucks, but something else that has really helped me- exercise. I started with yoga and going for a walk on a nice day while listening to some music. If you're ever feeling up to it- give it a try.  It helps you de-stress and be a little active at the same time. I hope feel better soon, I know it sucks."

"It looks like Johns Hopkins has a Sjogrens Syndrome Center in Baltimore, that may be a good option if you can work it out with your insurance.  Their website says you will need a referral from your doctor, but if you're able to see somebody there they almost definitely should be able to get you a good treatment plan."
Here is their website: http://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/
HUGE HUGS!! I was just diagnosed about a month or so ago and it sucks big time both my regular Docs are stumped because they havent see someone with it in ages. My Rhuematologist says that because I have SLE Lupus thats why I got the Sjogrens they come hand in hand. Right now I am taking Lyrica for the pain not much help for me because it makes me even more tired then I was before so I only take it at night when I can devote 9-12 hours to sleep they say that cymbalta works but I didn't like that at all and stopped taking it.
"My daughter has the same. She lives with a lot of pain, but had some relief from tramidol. She decided not to use it long term though, because she felt the pain was worse when it wore off. She is also chronically tired, and has four kids, so she can tell you getting enough rest is terribly important. You are not making up excuses, and it is NOT your fault-it can make you feel awful. I think they had her try nerontin (sp.?) for the pain, and I believe she felt it worked better for her than tramidol. If you get dry eyes like she was having at first, they make drops for that. She had to keep them right at hand for a while."
"I know this was submitted a month ago but I just wanted to say that I feel just like you! I'm miserable. I went to a rheumatologist for a few years but all he did was write my prescription for plaquenil and it was a three hour drive each way. I cried to him. I told him how I felt. He said ""what do you expect? You have Sjogren's"". He resigned from the hospital eventually and now I have no specialist. I have a regular doctor prescribing my plaquenil now. There is no-one else to treat me. It sucks. You are not alone."
"I did see a rheumatologist but he was very dismissive even though I have the diagnosis from another doctor. He didn't seem to really understand what Sjogrens was and told me that it couldn't cause aches or fatigue. I left in tears. I know I should try and find another doctor, it's just always such a headache with my healthcare..."

Glad to know I'm not the only one who feels this way though (not that I'd ever wish it on anyone else!). Thank you so much for your comment. I have heard of Plaquenil.... will look into it!
"Thanks for your reply. You're right, I think the key to figuring this out will be finding the right rheumatologist. I'm glad to hear that there are ways to live with this... it feels really hopeless sometimes. I am hopeful that meds will make a difference. It's hard to be your own advocate when you're so damn tired all the time and depressed on top of it. I really appreciate your input! :)"
I already deal with issues with depression and added Adderall for ADD a couple years ago. It ended in a complete mental breakdown. I had been prescribed as a teenager and had no issues... who knows? I have heard that though and was really hopeful it would help! And I was told I have Celiac sensitivity... I've heard a little bit about it in relation to SS but could you elaborate?? Thanks!
Thank you for the thoughtful reply! I wouldn't wish this on anyone but it's good to know that I'm not alone and it's not just all in my head.

"I have also noticed that on the days that my depression and anxiety is at its worst, I feel worse physically. I actually believe I saw a study proving some sort of correlation a few years back... or at least have heard other people say that they experience similar symptoms. Definitely something I've thought a lot about. I know that regardless, finding ways to improve my mental health will help me get through the day. Unfortunately, anti-depressants and other related medications have only made my depression worst in the past and I have been on a LOT of meds. I know finding a therapist is also important but have had trouble finding one I really feel helps me."

Will look into the Vitamin D deficiency. I've had so many different recs from people and it gets overwhelming when trying to figure out what things are worth looking into so it's nice to hear from someone who experiences a lot of the same symptoms!

"And I know, I know, exercise! It's very true though, I do feel better every time I get out and do something, it's just finding the motivation to get up and do it when I feel like crap. I did some yoga as a teenager and have really been wanting to get back into. Just moved to Baltimore so have been looking for affordable studios or gyms in my area."

"I actually looked into the SS program at Hopkins a couple years back at the recommendation of a doctor. My insurance doesn't cover it and even though it's expensive, my parents offered to pay out of pocket. They wouldn't accept any sort of self pay, only qualifying insurance plans! The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Thanks for the suggestion though!! :)"
"I really feel for your daughter, cannot imagine doing this with 4 kids! Can't even do it with 2 cats! Thank you so much for the encouragement and reassurance. I deal with depression and I feel like the chronic fatigue has just made everything that much worse. I will look into those meds!"
Goodness! You need a hug! Right now it seems like the fatigue will last forever and the pain just goes on. But it will get better. It's just hard to see past it right now. Is there anyone who can go with you to your doctor's visits? I remember when I was fatigued and in pain it was hard just to remember what I wanted to ask the doctor. I really feel for you because I've been there. Maybe try asking in the Baltimore subreddit if anyone can recommend a reliable rheumatologist?
If you can find a different rheumatologist. Not all are very good with SS.
That Rheumy was a jerk!

My current rheumy (who is also a jerk ... but that's because he has no bed side manner at all and very abrasive ... and tragically really good at his medicine) added Sjogrens into my mix and was pretty sure it didn't get picked up because the aches and pains and fatigue were all brushed off by other doctors as part of my lupus so unless you were looking for Sjogrens there was no point in testing for it.

Sjogrens is so much more than just dry mouth or dry eyes. Some days I fight to just breath and it feels like someone is sitting on my chest almost like the insides of my lungs have dried out.


[deleted]
Here is a study about it- http://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v94/n4/abs/ajg1999236a.html

Sjogren's is often listed as a risk factor for Celiac now.
"Yeah, I don't know how she does it either, and since her husband and I work, we can't always be there to help."
"In your case, if the depression is bad, it's not a weakness to go talk to someone who can help with that. I would advise making sure they understand what an autoimmune disease is, though. I hope you find some treatment that makes you feel better, a rheumatologist who know what they're doing is crucial. Hang in there! Hugs. :)"
"Aw, thank you. Definitely could! And yeah, the fatigue and pain have taken so much out of me. I feel like a completely different person than I was a few years ago. My lack of energy and resulting depression was a part of the decline of my most recent relationship (though we had PLENTY of other issues, haha)."

My parents are very supportive and are willing to accompany me to appointments. My mother has rheumatoid arthritis and although it's not  quite the same I know she can relate to a lot of my frustrations.

"Good idea about the Baltimore sub, thanks for the suggestions!"
"Spoke to my parents yesterday and they are willing to help me find someone who is familiar with SS, even if they're not covered by my insurance."
"I'm trying! Some days I just get so overwhelmed... Thank you for the support, I know I'll figure this thing out eventually. I definitely need to find a good rheumy first and foremost."
Thanks so much for the source. Taking a look at it now!
Thanks! :)
That's great!
You're welcome! I hope it's helpful.
"That's alright. I know it's hard, I've seen what my daughter goes through and I don't wish that on anyone. With the right treatment some people feel much better though, and I hope you get the help you need. :)"
"It was, thanks!"
"I like thera tears but nothing is really perfect. I also like to use regular artificial tears (store brand) and overfill my eye until it starts leaking out, it helps to rinse it."

I also will intentionally watch sad videos sometimes to force myself to cry...

But you might want to look into punctal plugs too
It’s better for your eyes to use the single use drops without preservatives
"The best thing I’ve done for my eye dryness is taking Cevimeline. My rheumy put me on it right away, before I was officially diagnosed. Maybe you can call your doctor and see if they think it’s a good option for you?"
"Get a rx for Xiidra it’s similar to restasis. Used twice a day, consistently, it’ll help alleviate dryness and sensitivities to fans, wind, etc"

For OTC drops I use Thera tears.
I use a combination of the Candor Hylo (blue bottle) and Candor Hylo Gel (Gray bottle).

"Gel in the morning, afternoon and before bed. Regular for whenever I feel dry."

If they’re extra dry I’ll do a drop of Gel and then a drop of regular to help it spread around faster.

[https://candorvision.com/professionals/hylo/](https://candorvision.com/professionals/hylo/)
"I use Refresh Plus single use vials and TheraTears bottle. I think taking fish oil supplements also helps. Punctal plugs, as someone else already suggested, are good, too."
I use refresh eye drops
"I order Hycosan on Amazon in the UK. It takes about 3 weeks to get to me, but it’s worth it. I wear contacts because they don’t dehydrate as fast as my regular eyes. I use Bausch &Lomb sensitive eyes for then. And periodically Hycosan. I also use the Hycosan ointment at night before I go to bed. It is SO nice to wake up to non-sandpaper eyes."

I hit you eyes with drops about every hour. It’s a lot. But those are the only brands I’ve tried that don’t sting.
I take Xiidra and use nighttime ointment every single night immediately before going to bed. That specifically has helped my eyes enormously - Xiidra may or may not be working. Good luck!!
Retaine MGD are the OTC drops I use. My Ophthalmologist usually puts people on Oasis but said to stick with Retaine since it seems to be working good.
At night while you’re sleeping use an ointment like VITA-POS in your eyes it can be found on amazon.
I use refresh artifical tears single use vials.
"My eye doctor suggested against punctal plugs, he said there’s new research that they keep more dirt/bacteria in the eye since the eyes are not draining"
"I get it religiously. I’ve twice tried going without and regretted it with getting a flu that never seemed to end. Yes, I flared mildly the next day after the shot, but I planned for it, rested, and by the next day was back to feeling “normal.”"

There’s also a pneumonia shot for people with weak immune systems like ours. Highly recommend.
I've gotten it countless times without issue and plan to get it again soon. Flu this year is supposed to be bad.
"I also get the flu shot every year. I react with a mild flare the next day, so I plan around this. A day with a mild flare is far easier to deal with than getting the flu."
Not an issue at all. You’re better off to have the shot
Omg... I need more coffee. I read this as “Onions and experience...”. I was gonna comment that onions bother me too...
"I always get mine, and stay current with my pneumonia vaccine. I've never had a flare afterwards."
I've got it for the past 2 years and no flares at all.
Thanks! I didn’t realize there was a separate one too
"Lol yes, onions bother me too, I cut out all nightshades, onions, raw tomatoes and unfortunately garlic and I’ve been doing pretty good. I juice every morning too."
You were diagnosed just based on the fact that you get better with doxy? That’s crazy. Go get the blood tests. Doxy is used for dry eye in many people.

"Also, azithromycin is supposed to be even more effective with a shorter dose, and with fewer side effects."
Doxycycline is classified as an antibiotic. Too much of it and you'll develop an immunity. Doctors are prescribing less and less antibiotics these days unless absolutely necessary.
What dosage do you take?  Do you have dry eyes as well?

"Doxycycline is a treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction, which is a part of dry eye.  So maybe a different optometrist / opthamologist would prescribe it if you also have MGD?  I know Sjogrens prevents tear production but MGD can also be present as well.  Might be worth seeing if you have that and if you could get a prescription via an eye doctor who specializes in dry eye.  Although the dosage for dry eye may be lower than you have taken in the past."
"I'm on doxycycline for rosacea, and wouldn't say that it has any effect on my Sjogrens symptoms. One thing I have noticed is that persistent antibiotic use had made me more susceptible to sjogrens-related oral infections."
"No, I got referred rheumatologist because of it."

"I have positive results for eye tests, blood work, ultrasounds, and Sjo test."
Also every symptom of Sjogrens.

First rheumatologist wouldn't take me serious.
I had to press hard on second one to run the tests.

"I showed neruo-ophthalmologist a four page symptom sheet, that included what seemed to help, and what made things worse."

"He read through it, and started asking me about dry eyes and mouth. Something that wasn't even on the sheet."
He then ran the test for dry eyes. Which I failed.
"Said I had Sjogren's.   The antibiotic helping things, was what he's seen a lot of."
"Told me to go to a rheumatologist, and if they don't like the antibiotic part, to keep searching."
"I've come to find out, that it's super controversial, and doctors get bent out of shape on the topic."

Theory is there is an intercellular bacteria that munches on vitamin d.  Which is why a lot of Sjogren's patients have low Vit D. (I do).
"Body attacks this infection, which is the underlying cause of at least some Sjogren's patients."

"Again, this view is highly controversial.  It may only be a subset of Sjogren's true cause."

"However I've seen around 20 doctors seeking help, and the first guy to find out what's going on did so based on his personal observation of antibiotics.  It took months of pushing other doctors to even run the tests so I could confirm it."

"Well damn, I'm going to listen to him. And screw any doctor that says otherwise.  Nearly died several times over from their arrogance and incompetence."

It's been a rough few years.
> MGD

"Eyes are dry. Not my primary compliant, but is a big deal on it's own."
It's the overwhelming fatigue and pain that I'm trying to cope with.
Oh ok. Thanks for the explanation.

"So, there are many theories out there about the genesis of autoimmune disorders being bacterial. I happen to agree with them in principle — that there is some underlying sub clinical “infection” that just drives the immune system crazy."

"Of course, the question is how to treat it if that’s the case. Which antibiotic? For how long? Weeks? Months?"

"If you’ve seen success with doxy, you may want to research how it has been used in long term treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. As far as safety, I personally know someone who has used it every day for years to help with their skin."

"In any event, I wish you luck. And I’m with you about taking this into your own hands. If we wait for some cure to be invented by the pharmaceutical companies, we will die waiting. They are first and foremost not in the curing business anymore. Just lifelong treatments."
Plaquenil would probably be a more appropriate and available treatment for fatigue and pain symptoms.
On it.  Helps a little.

I use a humidifier overnight and it makes a big difference for how poorly I feel when I wake up
"I use a humidifier at night in the winter when the air seems so much drier. Where I live, it’s very humid in the summer, so no additional moisture is needed in the air."
"The overnight humidifier helps me if the a/c or heater is blowing. If we didn’t use air conditioning in the summer, which dries out the air, I’d probably just use the humidifier in winter. I would def keep it in winter in your case! It really helps with nightly use."
"I guess I was thinking of using it for sleeping, just so I don't wake up as often to sip water! Do you use one?"
"Prescription Evoxac (generic is cevemeline), a saliva production med, has been a life changer for me. Makes it so I can sleep through the night. A happy side effect for a while was it also produce tears for eye relief. If that doesn't work, another prescription production med is Salagen (generic is pilocarpine)."

"I use a humidifier, too, but it's more to help my nose and sinuses."
"I’ve seen several people say that thyroid issues, like Hashimoto’s, can cause sicca symptoms. Is it possible that you have a different autoimmune issue that the Plaquenil was helping?"
Who is saying no Sjogren's? Is this a rheumatologist? Only one in ten folks with dry mouth and eyes have Sjogren's.
Negative lip biopsy.
Positive ultrasound.
"That's interesting. I have elevated rheumatoid factor but I don't have the Sjogren's markers (ANA, I think). I'm going to ask my rheumatologist about this possibility. Thanks!"
It was the ultrasound tech that said I didn't have Sjogren's. A prior rheumatologist originally diagnosed me based on symptoms and the fact they got better after starting Plaquenil.
"If you need to stay off plaquenil, you might want to ask him/her about LDN too. Sometimes primary physicians will prescribe it if a rheumatologist won’t."
"Lots of people (30% of Sjögren’s patients, I think, although I could be remembering that wrong) don’t have the Sjögren’s markers but do have Sjögren’s - by which I mean they have the same symptoms as people with Sjögren’s markers, and treatments have the same effect on them as they do on people with Sjögren’s markers. All the auto immune conditions seem to be less unique illnesses and more just names given to clusters of commonly associated symptoms and treatments. I’m exaggerating, of course, but there is so much crossover, I find it simpler to consider “stupid immune system” the disease and look at the individual disorders as just different presentations."
I would not take the word of the ultrasound tech with any more grains of salt than I would any other non-doctor.  They are not trained to diagnose anything and really shouldn't have said that.  If your rheumatologist believes  you have sjogrens I would believe that over the tech.
"He can't do that. S/He can't decide you don't have Sjogren's, s/he doesn't know what s/he's talking about. They aren't even supposed to utter their opinions to a patient (at least in the U.S.)"
"I was wondering about this too...I wonder how many Sjogren’s cases they have seen, and how many salivary glands they’ve looked at. Do you know how experienced they were, OP?"
"To be honest, I was kind of surprised she said that to me because I'm used to hearing results from the doctor later on. I am in the US by the way."
"You know, when my glands get inflamed, they get blocked with some white stringy stuff (sorry, ik it's gross). I've assumed it was mucus plugs, but I've begun to wonder if it might be white blood cells? Idk if there big enough to accumulate like that"
"Lymphocytes constantly traffic in and out of all our tissues, including our salivary and tear glands.   When there is an ongoing inflammatory activity, such as what happens with Sjogren's, there is an accumulation of lymphocytes in the glands.  Autoimmune treatments, in general, try to reduce the lymphocyte response to the cytokines etc that are released during an inflammatory response and this reduces the lymphocyte trafficking to the site of inflammation.  Autoimmune treatment can reduce the potential for future damage, but unfortunately really doesn't affect any prior tissue damage.  This is an oversimplification, but yes, you can reduce lymphocyte infiltration and this will reduce potential for future damage."
"I'm not on any meds.  My rheumatologist seems to see them as something you move to when you can't function anymore.  Do people here have a different view of this?  Should I be on medication to reduce lymphocyte infiltration?  (I'm on an anti-inflammatory diet, that's it.)"
"One thing to mention is that you should have a good talk with your dentist and an ophthalmologist about your diagnosis. A rheum really doesn’t have the expertise on those areas, whereas a dentist may bring you in for extra cleanings or prescribe things to maintain your dental health, and an eye doc can monitor your dryness and eye health. I would prefer to prevent issues now rather than treat them later!"

"It’s true that we have no baseline for what normal is, and I think these symptoms just increase imperceptibly over time."

"For example, I have always drunk a TON of water and when I switched to biotene toothpaste, I noticed an immediate difference to how “thirsty” (or dry, but I thought it was thirsty) I was. Hope this helps!"
"Look into LDN, Low Dose Naltrexone if you ever notice fatigue/brain fog.   There are Facebook groups with 30,000+ members about this drug and it's benefits.  It's what helps get me through the day. Not sure plaquenil really does much...."
"Everyone is so different, and every day is different, too. I didn't think I had dry eyes or mouth either at diagnosis. My fatigue, pain, and stomach are what lead me to try to find out what was wrong."

"I was diagnosed almost 3 years ago (I'm 36F). There have been terrible days (flares), but there are okay days, too. Medicine has helped (for me, gabapentin and plaquenil)."

"Keep drinking, move when you can (helps stiffness), and also rest when you can."
"Do you see a rheumatologist? My GP was awful, but my ortho (hip bursitis) got me into a rheumatologist. I have since changed GPs."

To not believe medical studies is beyond my understanding! I'm an English teacher.. I sort through the trash and I take things with a grain of salt. I do come up with a lot of questions for the doctor... Yours sounds like it could be neuropathy based on my experience.

"If you have facebook, there's a good support group there."
"This is a really interesting question, so I’m replying even though it was asked over a month ago."
"I only developed Sjögren’s badly about 8 months ago, following a really bad case of the flu (felt like it basically never went away).  However, some symptoms I’d had for over twenty years, so it seems likely to me that I’ve had it since then, but it wasn’t very active - I never felt like the symptoms interfered with my life beyond mild irritation until very recently.  Since I’ve read over and over about it being triggered by a bad illness, my suggestion is to always get flu shots and do your best to stay out of situations likely to result in illness or infection, so it doesn’t get triggered."

"In more detail: I’ve had dry itchy eyes all my adult life, that have steadily gotten worse and worse over the years. I couldn’t wear contacts or go outside on windy dry days, but I didn’t bother with eyedrops or anything (partially because putting them in hurt) till I started getting double vision and light sensitivity 8 months ago, and the eye doctor said it was because of a lack of tears.  At that point I learned that if I kept my eyes moist, it wouldn’t hurt to add eyedrops. I now put drops in several times a day, and gel in at night."

"I’ve had regular feelings of a congested nose and throat for all my adult life too; doctor thought it was a nasal drip causing constant congestion, but it was actually a lack of mucus and saliva causing my nose and throat to get really dry, making hard to swallow or breathe through my nose.  Didn’t interfere with life till 8 months ago, when it suddenly got so dry it feels like I have a permanent sore throat, and I keep getting nose bleeds."

"Ditto for vaginal dryness: My first Pap smear was agonizingly painful - I thought the nurse was just an ass since she hadn’t believed me that I was a virgin at 20, but it’s been agonizing every time since also.  Given that, and that I have now discovered that I don’t produce the normal vaginal secretions, I’m pretty sure that I’ve been really dry there for decades.  However, since I‘m generally not sexually active (I’m asexual) that didn’t impact my life much until 8 months ago, when suddenly I got so dry it gets painful and distracting down there even when I’m not doing anything."

"On top of that, 8 months ago I got a bunch of new symptoms - tingling, rashes, vertigo, temperature oddities, pimples, severe fatigue, diarrhea ...  it definitely got triggered by something to go into overdrive like that.  I’m hoping to find a way to put it back to how it was a year ago, because it wasn’t that much of a bother then."
"My rheumatologist has referred me to an ophthalmologist so that's great.  I'll talk with my dentist about the dry mouth.  I've always been bewildered as to why everyone else doesn't hydrate like I do. How do they manage on so little water? I mean, aren't they thirsty??? Didn't know I was the odd one out.  Haha. I'll check out biotene.  Thanks!"
My doctor refuses to prescribe Plaquenil and says there is no link between it's use and Sjogrens.  He begrudgingly prescribed gabapentin after months of wrangling.  However I am told it will not help me at all and might make me worse.  How did they help you?
"Thanks for sharing this.  I'm staying active, hydrated, and generally eat a very nutritious diet. Picture of health, my rheumatologist says. For now, I guess.  I've experienced sudden bloating in recent months. Might be part of my descent.  Hope to enjoy the health I have and stay clear of meds for as long as possible."
"My rheumatologist is awesome.  She seems on top of things and has sent me for many scans and to many specialists to get everything checked out.  She's very proactive.  My GP is terrible.  Nice enough person, but I prefer Google and Reddit over a visit to her.  (Once she even said she didn't know much about one of my conditions and told me to Google the info instead.)"

I'll look for the Facebook support group too. Thanks.
Thanks for sharing this and adding the details.  I'm sorry to hear it has turned on you so quickly.

"Currently at home in bed with the first cold I've had in over two years, a headache, a sore hip and what feels like seasonal allergies even though I usually never have those symptoms this time of year.  Your response is eerily timely.  I've never had a flu shot; never been hit with the flu hard."

"I hope this isn't the beginning of my descent.  Like you, I wonder if I've just lived with some symptoms and thought it was normal. Doesn't everyone's eyes feel dry at some point? Doesn't everyone drink copious amounts of water throughout the day? Thinking back, estheticians used to tell me my skin was dry.  I never felt it.  I've noticed the GI disturbances in recent months and tried to attribute that to aging and new food sensitivities."

I'll talk with my dr about the flu shot.  Thanks for the tip.  Good luck.
"Is it possible to find a new doctor? Gabapentin helped the excruciating pain I had, mostly in my legs.. They assume neuropathy though they haven't tested for it. I stay on a lower dose as higher doses do have more risks."

"Plaquenil helped with fatigue, and they believe it will decrease chances of organ involvement. I would encourage you to look up some studies that show why it is used, and consider sharing them with your doctor."
I wish you the best. I have terrible digestive issues.
I tried another GP and he was every bit as unconcerned and ignorant.  I had to get tested privately in the end but can't stay private as I can't afford it. (NHS UK).  They refuse to accept it would be neuropathy in my case either.  Do you think it might be?  Some days it lessens and some it goes.  It's like horrible prickling pain and some muscle convulsions.  Please don't say it's neuropathy.  I will no longer share anything with the doctor.  He says that the internet or studies cannot be trusted.  He will not read the documents and says it makes no difference.  He told me even if it was all correct he still couldn't recommend anything.  He got angry with me and said look there's nothing that can be done.  He wouldn't even listen to the advice of the Sjogrens or any foundation I presented him with.  Same for the other doctor (they play golf together).
It decreases organ involvement and helps with fatigue?  These doctors refused to accept that it is even used at all for any auto immunes!  I have had these problems get worse over a year.  I will not forgive them.
I suppose i'm going to have to try Gabapentin.  I'm scared witless by the negative stories.
I've forgotten a dose here or there and recently halved the dose I was taking. I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms. I hope that will be the same for you.
No I didn't have any withdrawal
"I went off it and did not have any withdrawals. I was on it for about 5 months. I went off because I didn’t feel any different, I still feel the same like when I was on it"
"My dose was recently cut in half. I’m definitely feeling more brain fog, aches and joint pain."
"Eh...I just always have a drink with me. I can't stand biotin or any of that garbage, but I have scleroderma as well so dry mouth in combination with swallowing issues is a bit challenging. Mouth always feels dry and sometimes gets crazy bad...My eyes feel like they have sand in them most of the time. I have to use artificial tears 3x a day. Both mouth and eyes get worse with flare ups. I think the best thing to do is try and avoid stress like its the plague, but everyone with these types of conditions is different. Some people swear by anti-inflammatory diet, others say doesn't help at all...No matter what, stay positive and research A LOT. You just have to find what works best for you. I don't have any answers for you about anything else. I try not to even think about the fact that I have these things, but I am years in to it, kind of in the ""it is what it is"" zone. I hope you find answers and stay well."
"I take an obscene amount of fish oil (8000 mg a day), and it's enough to keep me feeling okay. I wouldn't say ""normal"", but okay. My eyes are drier than average, but I don't feel like they're full of sand. For example, they're way more sensitive to fumes than normal, but I don't need to use tons of eyedrops. Similarly, my mouth is dry enough to impact long term dental health, but I don't feel like it's full of cotton anymore."
"No cure, yet.  There are a few studies going on for other AI issues that could lead to targeted treatments, notably BTK inhibitors."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916986/

In the meantime I'd look into low dose Naltrexone. LDN.  It's a cheap effective drug with little to no side effects. It doesn't work for everyone but for some it dramatically improves fatigue and brain fog among other issues.
"There isn’t a cure. Management is the thing. Keep your eyes and mouth as moist as possible. If using artificial tears get the ones in the ampule that don’t have preservatives in them. Anti inflammatory diet might help, it certainly won’t hurt. Surgical tape keeping the mouth closed overnight - the stuff that you can peel off easily - feels weird at first but if your mouth doesn’t drop open in the night it won’t get quite so dry. Dental hygiene is vital. Take care of your gums. Lots of water. I take a biotin tablet daily, supposed to help with hair loss, which can be an issue with sjoegrens. And fish oil. A good quality fish oil is very beneficial. None of that ‘5000 for $10’ rubbish. And moisturise your skin. The dryness affects the whole of your body"
You’re a  dear for the ‘too dear’ compliment !
Yeah... it hasn’t gotten any better. But I’ve lived with Sjogren’s for so long that I feel like it’s “normal” now. Definitely always have a drink with you. Also keep gum with xylitol and/or mints. I LOVE the Therabreath dry mouth lozenges. They last for about 25 minutes when I’m exercising and allow me to work out without having my mouth get incredibly bone dry. I like Biotene products but I don’t think they are any magical solution for me. I could do better with dry eyes but I’m lazy. I take restasis drops twice a day and I hate them but they do help.

There’s also some prescription dry mouth spray from 3M that my dentist gave me a sample of. I didn’t like the aftertaste and it also didn’t help my throat stop feeling dry but it could work for others.

I recommend developing a good relationship with a dentist who cares about dry mouth and can offer helpful suggestions.
"Read up on omega 3 to omega 6 ratio. Omega 6 is pro-inflammatory and causes worsening of symptoms of autoimmune disease. I've had big improvement since I cut out vegetable oils and other omega 6 rich foods (FRIES, chips, peanuts) and started to take omega 3."

I'm looking into herbal immunomodulators like peony myself... anti-inflammation diet is very important too.

read this as well https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/cr7t6u/in_a_doubleblind_randomized_crossover_study_in/
"Thanks, otherside!  I take water everywhere."
"The problem with research is that I keep finding things that scare me.  My symptoms are mild, and I don't want them to get worse due to the stress of reading about scary stuff.  (I'm sure I didn't have dry eyes until I got the blood test results back, so that seems like a clear indication that diagnosis-related anxiety increased the disease activity.)"
Oh how long did it take you to notice the difference with all that Omega3?
Any smell?
"Thanks, MrMaury!  I will tuck this suggestion away.  No problems with fatigue or cognitive issues at this time."
"Thanks, johnsgrove!"
"I'm using Systane preservative free.  Mostly AM and PM, sometimes one other time during the day.  I tried Systane gel (without preservatives), but I think it made my blepharitis worse.  Do you do the warm compresses and lid scrubs?"
"The nutritionist recommended good fish oil, I'm on 2000 whatevers a day.  My skin is still okay, no drier than it's always been."
I was initially diagnosed with Sjögren because I mentioned that for some odd reason I always do a lot better for several weeks following a round of antibiotics.

Turns out there is research linking bacteria munching on  Vit D to Sjögren.

Also turns out that this is highly controversial and There is a huge pissing contest amongst Remutologist about it.

Fist one made it her personal mission to disprove the diagnosis.

Second one ran more tests and confirmed Sjögren

Yet no one will give me a prescription for antibiotics.
I will look for the Tbreath lozenges.  Haven't tried those yet.  I tried the ACT lozenges and was alarmed when I learned their pH was 5.7.
Why are Restasis drops unpleasant?
Thanks!  Didn't know peanuts are omega-6 rich; I use pb in my AM smoothie.  Will look into that.
Glad to hear you've seen a big improvement!  That's encouraging.
It took me a while to build up to that quantity.

"Now, I'd say I don't notice missing the occasional single day so much, but missing a few days is pretty obvious."
"I find the odorless ones effective, but they're about twice the price, so I use the smelly ones. I try to avoid doing anything that would make me burp around when I take them, but I don't find the smell super offensive."
I like doing lid scrubs and I have done warm compresses but I get lazy with it and don’t keep up with it.

I was also told by an ophthalmologist that my eyes don’t properly close so I’m apparently screwed. 😛
"Ironically warm compress on the eye is good for the eyelids, but using the eye drops cool is more soothing for the eyes! Do both alternatively I guess. I find sustaine too sticky. It gums up my eyes. Ok at night before I sleep. Don’t know where you are but in Australia I use Bion Tears (4ml)  and you can get more than one dose out of the ampule whatever the instructions say (this is advice from an opthamologist) too dear otherwise. In Europe Artelac is much the same but cheaper as the ampule contains 7ml. 2000 is the recommended dose of fish oil.  Good luck"
> Turns out there is research linking bacteria munching on Vit D to Sjögren.

"Can you write more on that, or have a source I could check out maybe?"
I've had huge difficulties getting my vit. D levels up despite
"supplementation and no doctor knows why, this sounds interesting."
I find that restasis bugs my eyes shortly after I put my drops in. They burn a little.
Interesting!  Thanks.
"Yes, lid scrubs can help get the gunk off that can accumulate. Eyes not closing properly is a new one! There are other dryness issues that only affect women, but enough good news for now!"
"""Too dear""--I love yr accent!  :)"
"You know, I felt like the warm compresses might be increasing tear gland inflammation, so I stopped doing them.  Still clean the lids with diluted baby shampoo 2x/day."
"I will look for Bion Tears.  Good to have a backup, right?  I found Refresh preservative-free really irritated my eyes."
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090408164415.htm

http://autoimmunityresearch.org/preprints/WaterhouseAnnals2009Preprint.pdf
"Okay, thanks!  (It took me a while to realize the Refresh was irritating my eyes ... felt soothing when I put them in, but caused a cycle where I was using them more and more.  When I went back to Systane, they improved.)"
thank you
"Okay, just saw this!  Do you understand the research?  Would this also apply to Vitamin D created by the body in response to sun exposure?"
My eyes also really like the Systane brand. They feel the most “natural”.
I understand about 10% of the research.
"if theory is true, then probably yes.  More sun = more food."

Suppliants would also just give bacteria more food.

"Now sun exposure triggers bad flare for me.  Immune system goes nuts.  That's normal for Sjogren, and is solid science."

No clue if it's going nuts in response to Vit D munching bacteria or not; that's the super controversial science.  Some seem to think so.

I do know that antibiotics make me feel a lot better.
Original Diagnosis for Sjogren was made because the doctor had seen a lot of Sjogren patients that got better anytime they had antibiotics.
"Okay, that's really interesting."
It is hard to be making decisions about my health when the scientists disagree!
Yes!  I use air shield glasses that I bought online at dryeyeshop.com.  (I just went to their site and it looks like they've stopped selling most of them.)  I mostly wear them when I'm driving because driving seems to suck the moisture out of my eyes.  Not to sound dramatic but the glasses changed my life.  I was considering stopping driving because I was having so much trouble with my eyes and didn't feel it was safe to drive.  Ziena is the brand I have.
"Ziena moisture chamber glasses have been life changing for me! They are the most inconspicuous moisture chamber glasses I’ve found. Some people have told me they didn’t even notice the chambers until I mentioned it. They don’t create a full seal like swim goggles do but I find that better because they are less likely to fog. I highly recommend them, and the ear thingies they sell separately to fit the glasses snug to your face."
"On the topic of glasses, I love my giant bug-eyed prescription sunglasses. I find the light bothers me more than the heat, wondering if a combo sealed, tinted lens would help you?"
"Thanks everyone! I have a few options to check out, and now I know there's such a thing as [dryeyeshop.com](https://dryeyeshop.com)! :D"
"One thing I forgot to consider is my wide nose bridge (yay broken nose). I typically need adjustable-pad glasses in order to fit my face, but the only adjustable options are spendy.... I may need to make do with some cheapies and save up for something that fits better."
"Well, with dry eyes the wind blowing on them can’t be good. Any glasses would have to help"

"You have a typical positive lab result, but neither my SSA or my SSB were positive. I didn't test pos until I took the early antibodies test that's fairly new. You're lucky you got your answer so quickly."

"You'll likely go on Plaquenil, first thing, or the generic. If you can't stomach it, some say the name brand is less nauseating. Some people have zero issues with Plaquenil, though. It can help slow or stop damage from getting worse."

"Also there are drugs for dry mouth, dry eyes. If those are your only symptoms, of course, you are very fortunate."

"Best of luck, and welcome."
"Mine showed up SS-A positive, but from my understanding it can be either; autoimmune is a tricky little thing!"
"Yea I test positive for SS-A, SS-B, ANA. Ive had  Raynaud's Phenomenon for decades, but have no Sjogrens symptoms."
Thank you so much!
"You are awesome!! I'm an anxious person, the waiting game is killing me already. I know I've asked so many questions in the last few days, so thank you for always answering. Thank you for everything!!!!"
It's so wild!

"I'm an anxious person anyway, so the waiting game is killing me already!"
That's wild! I have all of the classic SS symptoms.
Folks were here to help me and convinced me to go after a dx. I'm happy to pay some forward. Thank you for your kind words.
For those of us with anxiety (myself included) autoimmune is seriously THE WORST. Not to make you freak out or anything 😅 it’s just so all over the place and even little things are like...wait...you’re telling me this is related?! It sucks but at least having a diagnosis is a slight comfort!
No idea there was a podcast. Thank you!
I just added to my list thanks.
Hope you enjoy it.
Hi fellow Texas inhabitant!

"I just got a cheap cool mist humidifier at HEB. If you expect to use it all the time you will probably want one with filters and that you can disassemble and throw in the dishwasher. They can get icky and the icky isn't good for you. Personally, I got a cheap one because I wasn't sure how well it would work for me. I don't use it as much as I thought I would. We tend to be pretty humid here anyway."

The best dry mouth lozenges I've found so far are the ACT ones in the toothpaste aisle at HEB. I've also used TheraBreath from Amazon but the mandarin mint ones taste weird and hurt my tongue/mouth. They also don't seem to work as well.

"For eyes, Thera Tears all the way, but if you're on a budget the HEB artificial tears are also decent (the non medicated ones, the preservatives and junk can hurt your eyes after a while)."

"For throat, tea mostly to be honest. I also like the sugar free Spiced Apple powder hot drink mix - find it near the cocoa. My throat doesn't tend to be an issue but I'm constantly drinking something. You might be able to use something like the Throat Coat tea."

"Aloe vera juice also seems to work wonders for me, but I have read that aloe vera can potentially ""trigger"" your immune system to go into overdrive. I haven't noticed that, I feel a lot more hydrated with aloe vera juice or coconut water than regular juice."

"For your nose, the NeilMed Sinus Rinse, although not intended to hydrate your sinuses, will shoot some saline water up there and probably feel a bit better."
"After going through too many humidifiers, I built one from a pond fogger. I riffed on this video (I got the fogger from them, but I bought the humidity controller and fan from amazon, other stuff I sourced locally): https://youtu.be/PHpCo_ZFgfE"

A few things to consider that I learned the hard way:

"* you will likely need a chimney of some sort - the foggers splash a lot, and the vapor can settle and condense on things - so try to get it up into the air so it can fully evaporate. You can also use some elbows and such to direct the vapor if needed."
"* they recommend a 3-emitter unit for the demo project, but I did OK with just a single one - it comes down to what you want to spend and the duty cycle (you'll get the most mileage generating a ton of mist for short bursts)."
* make sure the side walls of the bin and every possible surface that vapor or water touch are as flat as possible so they can be wiped down easily.
"* Algae/biofilm will build up on any above-water surface, so dry-fit things when possible so you can take things apart for cleaning. Plan ahead to ensure everything can be easily cleaned, and make sure its vinegar safe (bleach safe if you want to be really sure)"
"* if you use metal fasteners, make sure you use brass or other corrosion-resistant ones."
* make sure you use some sort of humidistat controller - these pond foggers can easily generate enough mist to make paint peel off walls and grow mold if you aren't careful.
"* its mostly silent, but there is a splashing/tinkling sound, so be prepared for that."
"* any connections need to be tightly sealed. The mist will leak out, and a small hole can cause dripping or sputtering. I used ""plastic safe"" plumbers putty that's used with acrylic sinks (the normal kind can degrade some plastics)."
"* you can't over-fill the container (there has to be a few inches of air above the emitter or it doesn't work, plus the splashing), so get a bin that is slightly bigger than you think you need."
"* speaking of which, once you dial in the maximum level, mark the bin so you don't over fill it. Its also a good idea to make a mark close to the lowest point, and how low it gets after a typical night/day of use so you can remember to fill it."

"The whole thing cost me ~$100, including messing up a few things.  The upsides vs a $40 humidifier:"

* precise control over the level of humidity
* you can use as big of a container as you want - no problems like running out of water in the middle
of the night.
"* auto-shutoff if it runs out of water, I've had some cheap humidifiers that just died when that happened."
"* not sensitive to dissolved solids or other water issues (so you can just use tap water, no need to treat it with chemicals)."
"* all components are replaceable, including the ceramic discs that are what typically goes bad in most ultrasonic humidifiers. The emitter kit I got came with three replacements in the box."
"* its way, way easier to clean and fill."

Some general notes about my setup:

* I added casters - I used two bins nested together. I put the casters in the bottom of the outer bin so I wouldn't have to worry about leaks.
* I have an anchor point in the lid for the emitter chord. The chord came with a rubber grommet that I use to hold the wire out of the water (and keep the emitter from moving around too much)
"* i used a variable-speed PC fan, so I could adjust the output. Its USB powered so I bought a power strip that has USB ports to plug everything into."
"* I used one of those air-tight bins with the blue foam gasket. I'm not sure if that matters really, but my thought was that it would mean I'd need a less powerful fan to move more vapor."
"* I bought the biggest fan I could - 120mm. Bigger fans move more air at a slower RPM, and that means less noise. The one I got was designed for home theater use, so it was also quiet to begin with."
"* I put some spacers between the lid of my bin and the fan, so it wouldn't get splashed. The hydro shop sells water-resistant fans but they are a lot more expensive."
For sinuses and dry nose I like genexa organic saline care nasal mist. Can get on amazon
I use Systane Ultra eye drops. It's what my eye doctor gives patients with Sjogrens. She said it works better than prescription ones. I love it. As for my dry mouth I have XyliMelts by OraCoat. I developed an allergy to artificial sweeteners which is deadly. So I have to be careful what I use and eat. Make sure you care for your teeth. I had all my teeth except 9 pulled last year. Was fitted for dentures but never use them. I hate how they feel. Haven't had to use a humidifier as it's not that dry where I'm at.
"I use xiidra when I absolutely must, not many left. I also use oasis tears plus which is what my eye doc recommended. I only have to do them four times a day but systane- it’s every hour. However, my eyes are still so dry. I also use eco eye - eye mask for people with Sjögrens."
"Please have a look at this exchange I had a couple of days ago about home remedies and OTC stuff that might help. I think sea buckthorn would be a good idea, keep in mind if it works an eye dryness test will come back negative probably. Peony apparently helps but again, it might sort out your immune system to the point where it won't show up if they check for antibodies... that's just my guess."

"Also, my ENT recommended something called Ponaris Nasal Emollient and Dropper for dry nose to me, from the reviews it seems like it might help for post-nasal drip too. Haven't tried it yet."
"Hello Fellow Texans, Just visited my dentist and they emphasized addressing the dry mouth with biotene or a similar product. Lack of saliva can start or exacerbate a lot of teeth problems."
A sleep mask has really helped and I bought a drying rack and put wet towels over and close the bedroom door. I live in New Mexico it’s extremely dry here
Thank you so much
"Oh definitely, I missed mentioning teeth in my post"

I spent about $2500 last year fixing my teeth from Sjogren's damage.

My dentist recommended ACT mouthwash to help restore the damaged enamel.

Xylitol gum is good for saliva production too - I like the Icebreakers Ice Cubes.

"Though I'm not sure if things like Biotene, ACT lozenges, xylitol gum, etc. really help if your salivary glands have completely given up. I would think that at that point you would need something else. Replacement saliva probably exists. (That sounds like not much fun)"

"OP, let me know if you want any tips for eyes/skin/hair/etc."
"Good info all-around, thank you."
No problem. Does this sub have a wiki or a list somewhere? I feel like we should make one
"You can't really compare the two directly. Punctual plugs prevent your tears from draining, which helps keep your eyes more lubricated, but do nothing about the underlying disease. Restasis contains a small amount of cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug, and helps prevent further damage to your tear production. I started Restasis nearly 7 years ago, and I credit it significantly with the fact that I still don't need over the counter eye drops today."

&#x200B;

"Certainly try the plugs, but even if they help I would consider Restasis, because the plugs are not going to prevent your immune system from damaging your tear glands further."
"I got punctual plugs this year, and still use restasis (going on 5years).  Plus, I also use preservative free eye ointment at night for flares."

"My optometrist put in trial plugs that dissolve after a week or so to see if I thought they helped, before we put the real ones in.  I definitely could/can tell a difference during the day.  You might see if getting the trial kind that dissolve is an option to see if you think they help."

"If nighttime is an issue, the ointment is great - but does cause blurry vision so should be used right before you close your eyes."

Restasis is stupid expensive... but is also the thing that overall helped the most.

Good luck!
"They're worth a shot, and while the procedure itself sounds intimidating, it's quick and (for me) painless. If you can feel the plugs, they're not in correctly."

Restasis and Xiidra are ridiculously expensive and also have some weird side effects/may not change anything at all. Go for punctual plugs.
Plugs over Restasis hands down. Lubricating drops and ointment at nighttime along with the plugs works better for me. Restasis wasn't worth the money imo.
"I have them. They definitely help, and for a long time was the only thing I needed. But they are not the complete answer. I use lubricating drops several times a day now."

"I did the temporary thing too, and they definitely made a difference. I did have one plug that would always pop out. The doctor finally just buried deep in so it wouldn’t come out."
"I have had them for a few years now and they've made a big difference. They could help collect tears if you produce any. Other than that, they keep eye drops in your eyes longer than usual because the drops don't drain."

"At first I only got the bottom puncta plugged but that made them worse. My doctor said the top puncta overcompensate to suction the moisture so she plugged the top a few days later. Since then, I have been more comfortable. i think it's worth a try."
I'm interested in trying the plugs and had zero idea there was a trial type! Thanks to the person who posted that.

I'm on xiidra and during that whole deal found that both companies (xiidra and restasis) have coupons that run secondary to your insurance. They should help to reduce your cost to 5-10 bucks. Xiidra was easier for me to get on my insurance. They wouldn't cover restasis and wanted a generic. So if you really want one of those perhaps ask for whichever one is covered.
"I definitely think they are worth a shot. I have them and had them well before being diagnosed with Sjogren's. I actually lost one a few years back so my ophthalmologist closed that eye's puncta permanently with a laser. That was sort of scary, but it's been good. I also have eye drops made from my blood, which sounds so gross, but is the best thing for my eyes. They're called autologous serum eye drops and are eye drops which are made from your  own blood serum and plasma that is spun out in a centrifuge to then make the serum. It more similar to your own tears than artificial tears and honestly feels the best for my eyes. Also, not the cheapest, but definitely something that sometimes is the only thing that helps me."
Definitely start with plugs. They take 2 seconds to insert and painless.  My eyes are extremely severely dry; the plugs help a little.
Trying both Restasis and Xidra I’m tandem with no noticeable change after a few months.
I had the plugs put in but one came out after a month and the second one a bit after. It wasn’t worth the money for me to get them replaced. I noticed more of a difference with my oral medication (plaquenil and imuran) than restasis or the plugs.
"I’ve had punctal plugs for about three years now and would never go back to being without them. Because of the plugs my eyes leak all the time, which is also very annoying, but it’s nothing compared to having eyes as dry as the desert and having infections all the time."
I’ve had 4 sets in 3 years lol 😂 not much help for some
I had one plug done to see if it helped (one eye was a ‘control’ and without). Liked it so much I got the holes cauterized. That was NOT fun but now I don’t have to worry about it :)
"I keep getting plugs put in but honestly, I don’t think they are helping at all. I score 0’s on the Schirmers dryness tests so I try anything hoping something will work."
"I used to have plugs for a few years, but felt like they kept inflamed tears on my eyes for longer, which actually irritated them more.  I’m now just on Xiidra and it seems to work well.  It’s not 100% by any means, but I don’t need OTC drops or scrubs throughout the day."
"I had the temporary ones put in, and they irritated me to no end, I'm pretty sure I managed to rub them out within a day or two. 🤷‍♀️"

"IMHO, people who don't have the problem I did get a lot of benefit from them, so they're worth a shot."
"Oh, I didn't realize what else Restasis had in it. I will check it out to see if it's in the budget"
And the drops burn 😬
"I didn't even know this was an option, that sounds interesting"
True.  The burning wasn't just when I put them in either. Stuck with it for 8 mos because I was told it'd take up to 6 to really be effective. Don't miss it at all.
They don't burn if you keep them in the refrigerator.
I think some don’t like to do it bc it’s more permanent but I’ve had issues my whole life so that was actually a plus for me. Good luck’
"They do seem to help me. Mine were so bad at one point it just felt like I permanently had sand in my eyes and they were so red. Regular drops weren't doing any good. So I'm glad I have them. They don't bother me much now, I just remember how bad it was when I first started them."
My optometrist said it had more to do with inflammation present. I'll give the fridge a shot though. Can't hurt.
"I use Optve Fushion, prescribed by my optician. He told me never to use eye drops with  preservatives as repeatedly using them would actually dry my eyes more."
"I buy theratears brand preservative-free drops as recommended by an eye doc. I have a daily and a night-time version and they both seem fine. However, dry eyes are not my most severe SS symptom, so they may not be heavy-duty enough for everyone."
"I just use store brand artificial tears. I vaguely remember reading something about if you use the eye drops with medication in them regularly, it can cause problems."
I use the Refresh omega 3 preservative free drops. Helps more than anything else I've tried!
I really like Blink brand (preservative free). It was recommended after I had lasik and I have liked it better than any other brand I tried.
I have xiidra for my eyes. The artificial tears just don't help me. I also take a mega red supplement and toss chai seeds into smoothies/some foods since they're supposed to be helpful.
Thank you!! I am learning so much about preservative-free drops thanks to you and the other reddittors who’ve commented here—wow :)
"I came here to recommend the preservative-free Thera Tears, too. I can definitely feel a difference between those and every other drop that I have tried. I won't use anything else. I first received them from the Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation."
Thanks! Yes I read that too! To stay away from stuff that relieves redness / is meant for allergies and temporary use.

"I use Systane Complete Optimal Dry Eye relief and after 3+ months can definitely say it does not work for me, lol! So just looking for both brand recommendations and also just other refs I maybe didn’t think of."
My eyes are extremely dry l live in the desert  and the doctor said it’s Sjorgens. He prescribed Restasis   Seems to help but along with that I use preservative free drops. Fans and AC make dry eye even worse.
Thank you!! 🙏Yay so happy to be getting all these enthusiastic recs :)
Currently trying this right now in this moment! It feels good! And I can see!!!
"Wow, thanks!! And I didn’t even know lasik with Sjrogren’s was possible!!! That’s amazing—I want lasik so badly and ruled myself out. Wow. I could cry, if I could cry... 😆"
Ooh thank you!! 🙏
"It's the best drop I've ever tried: better than at least five or six drugstore brands, and a prescription drop that made my whole mouth taste like metal for hours."
"When you say ""doesn't work"" do you mean ""gives no relief, even at first"" or that you end up having to constantly use it to keep your peepers hydrated?"

"If it's the latter, yeah, me too. I don't know of anything that fixes that."

I just have a little bottle of eye drops everywhere I tend to hang out. I have also used a humidifier while I'm sleeping and that helps as well
That one actually stung violently and made my problem worse! The Systane regular gel drop one or whatever worked much better. But not so much for someone who’s driving or busy.
God fans and ac are the worst for my eyes!! can’t even open them
"Well.... I had lasik before I knew I had sjogren's. My schirmer's test was 6mm and I was told later they wouldn't have done it if it had been 5mm or less. So I barely made the cut. At the time, they said if my dry eye was bothersome after lasik, they could plug my tear ducts to help. I haven't been overly bothered though. First, and mostly, because I'm used to having pretty dry eyes and at least it's not winter anymore."
Preservative-free Thera Tears it is!! Thank you all!! 🙏
Haha I meant more of the former — I guess there’s a quick split second of relief before instantly feeling dry again? And thanks for the humidifier idea!
"Thanks! I’ll try the gel. I’m guessing it’s not good for driving because of blurriness, right?"
Did u try the preservative free ointment for the night?
"Yep! The blur lasts quite awhile for me personally, probably an hour or more. But it feels soooo nice!"
"Oh wow, I didn’t even think to do it for night—doh!! Are we supposed to be putting on drops at night too?? Right now I just put in some refresh omega 3 preservative drops! The single use kind. One ampoule per eye. I think it’s working!!!! It’s been like 10 mins and no dry-out yet.... Ahhhhhyayyyyyyy 😃"
Thank you so much!!
I’m also very sensitive to sunlight. When I put products on my face it feels like they have fiberglass in them!
Do you notice whether the rash is associated with sun exposure? Some people with Sjogren's are photosensitive.
"What kind of pain is it? Muscular, joint, firey, or like needles/knives?"
"Sunlight might do it, a few minutes of it and I look like a lobster! Also,  I get the sleep issues and fatigue, too. The immunosuppressants help a lot, but then again, I'm on here well after three am..."
Have you ever thought about Lupus? People get a butterfly rash across their face during flares
"I would recommend switching to completely natural products for anything skin related. Try washing your clothes using a non bio washing liquid. I found I'm very sensitive to regular washing powder and when I switched my skin changed dramatically. Also a brand I use for my skin is Weleda, if you're interested."
Oh I should mention that although I’m sensitive to sunlight I’m hardly in it. I spend almost all my time in bed. I haven’t went outside today at all and it’s bad and on fire! Can you add pics on this thing??
Thanks I know Weleda as I used to buy my kids the toothpaste when they were younger. I’ve also used their sunscreen.
"Joint, nerve pain in my sciatic on both sides so that burns all down my legs"
"My rheumie is looking into lupus next but I experience similar and have pretty unusual sun exposure issues, within a minute of going outside with more than my forearms exposed in the sun I nearly faint, feel like I’m on fire sort of but it’s hard to explain it’s like I’m surrounded by fire, and like I’m going to hurl, my vision gets weird as well. I instantly have to get into a cool dark room when I made the mistake last. I’m having a flare with my recurrent corneal erosion as well due to the Sjogrens. Could Sjogrens cause all of that? 🧐 I really can hardly stand the sun anymore and it’s just crazy."
"Gosh is there anywhere on Reddit to get help learning the ropes on here? I’m so damn lost on how to use this system and it’s actually kinda embarrassing lol. I didn’t realize anyone responded to my OP and now it’s been over 2 MONTHS! Anyway, the bloodwork showing lupus was dismissed but like something is obviously up with me. It looks more like flushing than an actual rash and it goes away a few minutes to several hours after it happens. It can be brought on by stress, anxiety or absolutely nothing. It also is hot to the touch and feels like a bad sunburn. Sometimes if I’m laying on one side that will be the only side it affects.  It happens even when I’ve not been outside or even exposed to light coming through the curtains. I have room darkening curtains and sometimes don’t leave my room for at least 1/2 a day. On those days the only place I’ll go is the kitchen for something to eat and there’s no direct light from outside either. I’ve just gotten up at 7:30am and haven’t been anywhere yet a 1/2hr later and I feel it on me now. I actually think it may be mastocytosis, which is a mast cell disease. It’s explain so many of my symptoms, like the tachycardia I have frequently. Last week my heart rate was 146! I made a Dr appt. with dermatology and an allergist/immunologist so we will hopefully see soon! Thanks for responding guys! Also can anyone tell me how to post pics on reddit?"
I have thought of lupus and my rheumatologist is checking it but my ANA has always been negative so IDK. I also consistently get this “rash” but it also feels like I ALWAYS have a flare. I don’t get breaks from pain.
I’m sure your rheumatologist told you that many people show negative ANA test results with lupus. I hope you find an answer
He did not mention it. Never even brought up lupus at all. He also tried to downplay my Sjögren’s and said I have a “mild” form of the illness because of my #’s and because the bloodwork showed no inflammation. Idc what the bloodwork shows I’m miserable!
"There is no “guarantee” that any symptom will get worse, but the disease and the symptoms do usually progress in most people. The dryness was not my first symptom, but I’ve had the dryness for a few years and it tends to wax and wane for me. My ophthalmologist told me that the good news is that my eyes can’t get much more dry than they currently are, so we’ll see."

"I live in a very humid climate but sleep right next to a humidifier, and even then I usually wake up in the middle of the night to use eye drops and put gel in my nose. If I don’t my eyes are stuck together in the morning, which is painful, or I wake up with a bloody nose. I also have a dry throat and mouth. I’ve always got those cracks you mention on tongue, plus get bloody lips if I don’t always use chapstick. Some days my dry mouth is mild, other days it’s difficult to eat certain foods without having sips of water with it to help swallow. For my eyes I take xiidra and my ophthalmologist pulsates steroidal eye drops. Plus over the counter saline drops, obviously. You can buy saliva mouth wash."

"The Sjogren’s bloodwork lacks sensitivity, and that’s really an understatement. Lip biopsy is better but even that might have to be done during a flare. The testing for Sjogren’s (and treatment) is really still being worked out. I think it’s very poorly understood."
Diagnosed here.

"My mouth, eyes and nose dryness are getting worse. There are some days or weeks which are better than others, but the don't ever feel normal anymore."
"For years I didn't realize I had a slightly dry mouth, only when trying to spit (for DNA ancestry testing) I realized it took me quite a while to produce a few ml of saliva."
"Also my teeth were decaying faster (a few fillings a year) even though I keep them very clean, but I never made the connection with possible sjogren's."
It wasn't until I got the diagnoses that I realized this maybe isn't normal.
"Now my mouth is very dry, I am chewing gum almost all day long or I go crazy. And by that I mean that without gum my mouth gets so dry within a few minutes that swallowing almost becomes impossible and I have the feeling that I am choking on air. Yes, I am aware it sounds weird but it's really that bad."
"During the night I use Xylimelts (if you don't know them, please make sure to get them, they are life savers!) and I have a humidifier next to my bed."

"My nose never really was a problem until about a year ago, now I have to Vaseline or some lip balm in it to keep it from drying out. And I also have a lot of sores in my nose. And often small nose bleeds."

"For my eyes I use eye gel about 8 times a day, eye drops don't seem te help me much. Also I have glasses because that helps keep wind or air out of my eyes and helps the gel last a little longer."


"But keep in mind, this is just me. Everyone is different and I think I'm a pretty severe case and I've been undiagnosed for years. In my case they are now considering to surgically remove one of parotid glands because it is so inflamed and hurts so bad. Also it doesn't function at all anymore, and it's full of swollen lympg nodes according to the latest mri. I don't think most people diagnosed with sjogren's get to the point where they have to do that, so maybe you shouldn't compare yourself too much to me."

I really hope you get diagnosed or find some relieve anyway. And you can always DM me for advice.

Edit to add:
"The sjogren's antibodies (ss-a/b) in my blood are more often negative than positive, but my ANA is always (slightly) positive. I got the diagnosis after a parotid glad biopsy, eye exams and things like prolonged fatigue, painful joints, and having a few other autoimmune diseases."
My eyes were off and on at first. Like I might need otc drops for a month then be fine for a week or two. Then I'd be back to needing them. I wound up on xiidra and use that daily. Now if I forget I may have a good day or two but the difference is noticable after that. My eyes got pretty bad though. Like I could feel my eyelids over my eye if that makes sense. The sensation was super uncomfortable and weird. Super gritty too. Mega red has helped a little there too. Not a huge help but I'll take any help.

"My mouth isn't too bad but I'm constantly sipping on ice water. If I'm not so good about that for a day I spend all day feeling dehydrated. I can still get plenty of actual intake but not having that consistent wetting makes a difference. I like the act lozenges, and sometimes gum can help. Sometimes it just seems like a bad day and nothing helps that much."

My nose is just always dry. Saline spray doesn't do much.  Sometimes just putting some vaseline in my nostrils helps.

Skin is always bad. Best help I've had there is castor oil for hair and skin. It's very thick. Very greasy. Having it stick around can suck but it also means I don't need to apply lotion for a while and that's nice. Plus it doesn't seem to bother any eczema issues I'm cropping up with. My nails are just brittle and nothing seems to help there.

ETA- I do not have a diagnosis yet. I'm waiting on my first rheumatologist appointment. My doc did order the basic labs for Sjogrens but didn't take enough sample so they were not run. 🙄
No. I don't have normal days. My saliva volume and flow tested at zero. It's been more than a decade since anything resembled normal.
If 0 is normal and 10 is so dry I cant speak:
"Mouth dryness typically a 4, but if I'm active and not drinking water actively 8."
"Sometimes it feels ""normal"" but that'd be ""normal for me""."

I am currently trying out some xylitol losenges and love them. Just tried the Therabreath Mandarin and mint. Mouth feels great! started at a 7 and I'm down to a 2! Dentist gave me a prescription mouth rinse which was ineffective.

"Eyes are never ever normal. Always uncomfortable and if I don't treat them constantly then they will get worse, much much worse. So, eyes are always a 7, at worst a 10."

"I have also tried prescription drops,but find them painful and ineffective, possibly related to the preservatives in them. I use a combination of preservative-free drops by Refresh: Advanced Optive and Celluvisc (a gel drop)."

"Gel drops work best if I'm not attempting to read or drive, and I use them nightly and occasionally during the day."

I've tried a lot of eye drops and feel confident saying these are the best!
"My mouth is always dry and I need to drink water every hour or so. Sure, sometimes it's drier than usual but not much. My eyes are rarely dry. My nose is wet and I have to wipe it off occasionally."
I’ve just been officially diagnosed this week; and had no idea my constantly needing water /feeling thirsty was dry mouth. I go through probably 2 100ml bottles of water a day. Plus whatever I’m drinking with meals.

"My eyes aren’t really effected as much, but also hard to say as I have bad allergies and they water."
"Yea I am using biotene but I still feel like it doesn't really help with my tongue. It's actually not my entire mouth that's dry, it's just an unusual dryness/texture all over the top of my tongue."
"Ugh thank you, I also hope I get a diagnosis. I am scared shitless honestly and I don't deal well with shocking news usually. Here's to hoping I don't crumble."
"I'm sorry to hear. For me it's up and down, different days mean different things in my mouth."
"Thank you for your comment. Yeah my mouth I would say is the same, it's like a 4/10 on most days."

"My eyes are dry when I first wake up, but I don't feel like I consistently need eye drops. I only use them on and off so far. I'll keep your recommendations in mind :)"
"Now that I think about it, my mouth has been a bit dry in the past but I never had this weird texture on my tongue and all the inflamed salivary glands under my tongue that come and go. Now I just have a strange to guess texture"
"That sounds very unpleasant, I’m sorry you’re dealing with that!"

I can’t offer much experience yet as I’m still learning everything I can- have you checked out any other groups? Some of the Facebook groups do seem to have a good population to bounce ideas off of.

Just know we’re all with ya 👊🏼
"Have the same, don’t know what it means tho"
I’ve read that SSA antibodies only are more associated with women who get pregnant and have babies born with neonatal lupus or congenital heart defects. I’m also only positive for SSA but always positive for ANA.
Count me in as well  (both the 52- and 60- subtypes).

I know SS-A means higher susceptibility to photosensitive.
I’m the reverse and have no idea what it means either. I’ve scoured the internet for an explanation and have found nothing.
I’m the same. Not sure what it means either.
I don't either. My dr hasn't said anything yet.
Same! Although sometimes my ssa is negative too.
ANA is always positive though
Thank you for the clarification. this confused me
I’m SS-B and my photosensitivity is getting worse and worse. Do you have a source for your info? My rheumatologist knows squat.
Sorry - wasn't trying to suggest that SS-B was not associated with photosensitivity - I just knew that SS-A was. SS-B may well be as well.

"Here are a couple links for SS-A and photosensitivity.  It indicates that photosensitivity is more common in pts with SS-A than no SS-A.   SS-A is not a prerequisite for photosensitivity - it is just more common in pts that have it. And of course, not all pts with SS-A will have photosensitivity."

The only info I’ve found on B vs A is that A is more common and that B can also show up for Lupus. My rheumatologist sucks, actually most of my doctors aren’t great. The only two that have been of help info-wise are my allergist and my medical marijuana doctor."
I'm with you - it is a pain!
"Your symptoms sound very similar to mine. I agree with others - you have to take the reins because doctors won’t. My blood work came back positive to Sjogren’s and lupus antibodies (plus elevated liver enzymes) and I started making calls for appointments - neurologist, gastroenterologist, and rheumatologist. Systemic Sjögren’s is definitely nothing to mess around with. Making sure you get full blood work up (WNC, kidneys, liver) and don’t let doctors play like this is “just dry eyes and mouth”. Keep a journal and not what triggers you. Everyday is different! 😂"
"If I go over 1 coffee per day, I feel completely drained on the next day. Respect your adrenals, give them a break. Coffee and energy drinks don't give you additional energy, they borrow it so you later crash."

"Other tips for fatigue (and random pain too), have your vitamin D checked, it can cause those things and its deficiency is very very common. Also, vit. B12 and ferritin (not iron) are two tests that everyone should do because those deficiencies are common and can really affect your well-being, especially your energy levels. You don't need to be vegan to be low on B12 or ferritin."

"My weakness in arms was caused by very tight back and shoulder muscles. Magnesium is amazing for anxiety and tight muscles (avoid magnesium oxide as it's useless; magnesium lactate and citrate are pretty well absorbed). I had to go to a massage therapist for a while to reset my muscles so to speak as they were so tight for such a long time, that they would go back to their ""normal"" setting after a massage, but with time and magnesium and yoga (yoga is great for that too) I was able to get to the poin where I don't need the massages anymore. The first few were brutal though, it's amazing how tight my back was and I didn't even realize it until my massage therapist started to work on it and I wanted to cry from pain."
"Read up on magnesium deficiency, it causes anxiety, insomnia, muscle pain and tightness, panic attacks, depression and more."

I suggest following the Sjogrens Syndrome Foundation on Facebook. They’re a great organization that helped me learn so much about this disease when diagnosed.
yes I. have severe debilitating fatigue. I am disabled and cannot. work. I was just. dx this. year. after 10 yrs of seeing  a rheumy. and an. Immunologist and neither one ever. tested. me for sjogrens. Sjogrens is a serious disease and has serious complications. Drs who don't take it seriously need. to be dismissed bb/c they can. put. you in danger by not getting you the treatment and testing you. need. This. can affect. vital organs and lungs.
I don't know why nobody has mentioned small fiber neuropathy. 30% of us have it. Sjogren's is a lot more than just dryness for some of us.
"My legs bother me, too. I take 200mg of gabapentin at bedtime, which helps calm the nerve pain so I can sleep. Also, stretching your calves and hamstrings each day helps a ton. I keep a yoga block b u my desk at work and stretch for at least 2 minutes per leg two to three times a day."
"Thank you so much for your response. I've had elevated liver enzymes for over 10 years. I have done a lot of tests. Kidneys are good. In a few weeks im going to do a echo and a pulmonary function test. I've even done an EMG and brain scans and ultrasound. These drs look at me like i am making up the symptoms. Few months ago my symtoms were so bad i couldnt pass my class. I was given 5 chances to take a test and pass it and i failed all 5 times because i cant retain info and the brain fog is out of control. I have endometriosis too on top of all this..drs diagnosed me with lupus, but the tests say otherwise. My new dr thinks i don't have lupus. I just want some answers. It's so complicated."
"Thanks. I am really trying to cut down on coffee, but i feel like i cant function without it. Most days i drink 1 cup, but somedays i need more.  I am vit d deficient, but learned that the vitamins don't really help. I am trying to get regular sunlight exposure. B 12 is good."
Thank you!  Does magnesium cause your legs to tense up or spasm? I've taken it a few times and each time I find my toes and legs spasming.
Thanks I'll look them up.
Thanks so much for your response.  I can feel my life falling apart and these drs aren't taking it seriously. Have you found any relief?
Did you do a specific test to get diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy?
my pulmonologist said every Sjogrens patient should have baseline pulmonary tests b/c the lung issues can be slow but life altering and. so they want to. interventions before any permanent damage. occurs. Most drs will not tell you this.
This is helpful: [Mayo Clinic on Sjogren’s and ANS](https://vimeo.com/267566774)
This study is useful[Neurological involvement in Sjogren’s ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5974632/)  and I agree with seeing a pulmonologist.
"r/decaf has some amazing stories... if I go over 1 cup I'm a different person, it gives me fatigue, a never-ending wave of racing thoughts and anxiety"

"Do you know your exact B12 levels? The lab norms can be tricky, levels as low as 200 are considered fine by many of them, in Japan anything below 500 is deficient. Some people have pretty bad health problems with what's considered ""normal"" levels that go away with supplementation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klobLSxv6i0"
Sunlight/ UV radiation can actually trigger an attack. It's best to go with a supplement.

"Magnesium should actually prevent your muscles from spasming or cramping. Unless the spasms could be a result of your muscles being so tense that the magnesium working to relax them triggers a response because they’re so used to being tense, if that makes sense? I use magnesium MALATE and it’s great. Brand I use: AOR"
"Never happened to me, but if you're dificient and they're very tight, who knows what might happen as magnesium starts to work... it definitely is not supposed to give you muscle spasms, quite the opposite, so I'd keep taking it, of course you might wanna consult with a doctor if you have a muscle disease or something like that, it's also not recommended with kidney problems but 400 mg a day is safe for most people, just split it into 2-3 doses as taken at once they might have a laxative effect, a take it away from coffee which depletes magnesium and prevents its absorption. Come to think of it, if you drink so much coffee it's pretty much a given you're deficcient."

"Another thing for tight muscles in addition to magnesium is progressive muscle relaxation, you can look it up, there are instructions on youtube."
I am just. now exploring treatment. ideas. I started Low dose naltrexone a month. ago and it. has really helped lower my pain and  give me a little more energy.  Helps me sleep as well. Visist LDN Science to learn more.  I have been. approved for IVIG and may do that and Im going to see a Dr. who treats with. VAGUS nerve stimulation (transdermal) it has been shown to alleviate a lot of fatigue an d pain. in Sjogrens but really in all autoimmune diseases its promising. Check out DR.  Nemecheks videos. Ill update in. here if I find some thins that help. Im not keen on IVIG but I may. do it b/c it can help reverse neuropathy.

&#x200B;

Id suggest if you have. pain to investigate if you. might. have Small fiber neuropathy ( skin biopsy confirms) or autonomic neuropathy ( Qsart tests) if. you have nervous system problems you can often get IVIG approved...

I also recommend an Autoimmune paleo diet - so no fair grains etc.... it will really help lower inflammation.  Im sorry you are sick and not getting answers but. it sounds like its time to look. for some  new ones..... I second contacting Sjogrens foundation for referral. But also sometimes you can consult with a. specialist on the phone to get you goin gin the right direction with. your local Dr.
"Yes. It depends on the doctor, but there is a biopsy they can do. Apparently, people with SFN (small-fiber neuropathy) have a disparity between the number of nerve fibers under their skin around their hip (proximal) compared to their ankle (distal). A 3mm circle of skin is punched out of both places. If there is a certain difference in number of nerve fibers between the two biopsies, symptoms are outlined and a diagnosis can be given. Most insurance companies require you to get a nerve conduction study, though, first, to rule out regular neuropathy, which often accompanies SFN. I believe that 30% of Sjogren's patients have SFN and the accompanying autonomic nervous system issues. You'd need a referral to a neurologist, and you better find one who understands SFN. You can look up local researching doctors on Google Scholar to find people who are into that stuff; they could probably at least refer you to someone who knows what they're doing."


"SFN is just now being recognized. It's really widespread and may be responsible for half the cases of supposed fibromyalgia. A whole lot of docs don't get it; don't realize that there is considerable pain involved with muscle cramping and spasms. They don't understand that it has the potential to do organ damage, for instance. They don't realize that it causes POTs and that a lot of us also have mast cell activation syndrome. So, yeah, be diligent and careful. Don't stay with someone who is going to shine you on."
Oh my. That's frightening. Thank you for the heads up.
Thank you I'll watch it tonight
Lab says norm is from 200 to 1100 mine is at 497. The only thing I'm deficient in vit d but that's about it.
Yes i have. My levels are normal.
Oh interesting! I never thought of it that way. I am very tense. When i drive i can feel my body and arms tensing up.  Sometimes i am so tense my arms shoot straight up in my sleep. I'll look at the brand you sent. Thank you!
Thank you so much you've been a great help!
but also be aware most people will not get this its just that the changes can go undetected until you wind up with problems so it stood. to just get a baseline
"Oh, and one thing I did was ask my GP to run an AMA antibodies test. It’s diagnostic for primary billiary cirrhosis, which is implicated with Sjogren’s and high liver enzymes. Waiting on my results!"
"I see, yeah, it's not a bad level."
"Half of people with B12 at 497 are deficient. That reference range is not accurate, never has been - In Japan they automatically supplement people that low. It won't hurt to see how 2,000 mcg a day makes you feel. Also, before supplementing get an MMA or homocysteine test because your levels are not good. There is an excellent B12 group online run by Tracey Witty. Check it out for more info."

Good luck 😉
"I have bad muscle spasming too. Exercise is over for me. If you can't take magnesium by mouth, try 2 cups of epsom salts in a hot bath. I actually brought my blood levels up just taking baths. And they are great for cramps."
"Talk to your doctor about muscle relaxers. Research has shown just one a day can stave off cramping and make you sleep better. Says my rheumy, I didn't check on it."
"So I take cyclobenzaprine once  every day and can take more for bad days. I also have baclofen and Salon Pas with lidocaine and a heating pad for when it's awful. If i don't try to do anything ever, I'm safe. Heaven forbid I should go to the grocery store or practice my guitar for a few hours."
Oh my! My thoughts are with you.
Oh interesting! I will look into this thank you!!
Thanks i found this one as well. I'll give it a try
"It could be negative, but I figured with elevated ALP its worth a look."
"Yep. I almost always am running a slight fever (99-100), especially if I'm recovering from a flare up.  And I would consider my Sjogrens pretty well managed."
It could be something else but what you described is common for what people can experience.
Yes. Low grade fevers have been a hallmark of my flareups for about five years. I am 29. Always accompanied by joint pain.
Same here. Low grade fever when I flare
"About 7 years ago, I had a low grade fever (I tracked it daily and it ranged from 99.1 to 101.1) for about 10 months. I didn't know about Sjogren's then, but I believe that it was a flare up in retrospect. I was ""diagnosed"" with Systemic Candidiasis by a homeopathic chiropractor (medical doctors could never find anything definitively wrong with me and they never seemed convinced that my elevated temperature was much of a symptom). After a few months of elimination diet and a ton of money worth of supplements, I got better. I hope yours isn't as long-lasting and is easier to get rid of."

"Looking back through my memories, my flare ups present a little differently every time. There are some things that remain the same but then a slight difference. My current one is involving my ability to eat, which is new. But also my ability to breathe, which is not new."
"I ALWAYS (well, for the last few years) run a 99-100 fever."
I take an MSM supplement.
For skin I'm a big fan of CeraVe. It feels super lightweight but also very moisturizing. If I have a really bad spot I mix a little bit of the richer Eucerin with CeraVe so it goes on smoother. Aveeno also has an eczema lotion that literally heals some of my stuff overnight completely.

"+1 for baby lips. I also like Chapstick's green tea formula, forget the exact name but it feels like it does better than the regular cherry or whatever it is."

"I also struggle with nails, I get several hang nails per week. I have developed a still of just ripping them out at the root with my fingers, which probably isn't the best solution but seems to work better than using tools. Something about the more organic ripped skin seems to heal better. But I tend to just not wear any nail polish and keep them cut short. I use Eucerin and CeraVe on my hands but also buy the heck out of hand cream. Aveeno's is really great and may replace my favorite, I also like Burt's Bees, but the Miracle something with aloe??? (I think it's the same people who do the miracle foot repair stuff) has been consistently best."

Also take a look at what you use in the shower. A lot of body washes are very drying with crap ingredients. Try to use colder water and good quality soaps.
"Sally Hansen vitamin e cuticle oil and maybelline baby lips to the rescue. Baby Lips are in my purse, work desk, bathroom and night stand. My cuticle oil is in my kitchen drawer next to the sink since that is where my hands kit the most water."

"Also, I use a cuticle trimmer once a week to get rid of the dry skin. I use a toddler toothbrush to exfoliate my lips, this is a must!"

My eyes are a different battle altogether...they are just bad...
"I use aquaphor. I dab it on, let it sit, then rub it in."
I use an e-file for the dry stuff and aquafor all the time. For the dry lips I use straight petroleum jelly.
"I also use Sally Hansen’s cuticle oil on my fingers and toes. I get gel nail polish, which is probably horrible, but if my nails are polished, they are much less likely to split or snag. I *never* let my nail tech cut or even push back my cuticles. I let her use an e-file last time, and it was a disaster. There must have been microcuts, and over the next week, I had hangnails on almost every nail."

"I like to wash my hands in warm water to soften everything up, apply cuticle oil and moisturizing cream, and put on my heated manicure mitts. It feels good for my RA, and my hands soak up the moisture."

"Lips, I use the Neutrogena version of a chapstick. BUT, I recently discovered a holy grail product. Laneige Special Care (wait for it) Lip Sleeping Mask In vanilla. It comes with a tiny **spatula** and it is amazing. I use it all the time, and love that I can clean the spatula (which comes in its own little vinyl packet) after each use. I keep wanting to use it on my cuticles, but never think of it at the right time."
"i use at night a vitmain e oil on my hands and cuticles then i seal it in with vaseline around my cuticles this really helps to keep the moisture in all night long and then during the day i have different hand moisturizers in every jacket pocket, at my work station and next to the soap dispensers at home. I like thicker moisturizers for my hands specially lately ive been using the soap and golory hand cream the call of fruity smell which is too strong but it maKes me happy and at home ive been using the laroche posay lipkar balm. which has no scent and feels amazing!"
"Based on y‘all’s recommendations, I got a Baby Lips today, and that thing is \*\*great\*\*! Very smooth and hydrating, it will definitely be a new weapon in the arsenal."
"I have one of those portable nail kits and am constantly trying to trim the worst dry bits before they peel or get caught on things. Super helpful, but definitely in need of something more preventative than that. I'll give your suggestions a try! Thank you!"
+1 for baby lips. The light blue one with pink text doesn't have any color to it and seems to be the most moisturizing of all the ones I have
"Rubber gloves next to the sink to prevent water on hands and nails. Williams Sonoma has nice thick ones that last a long time.On sale now (no, i don't work there) https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kitchen-gloves-blue/?pkey=s%7Cgloves%7C138"
"I can't thank you enough for the suggestion of Baby Lips. The small things in this world really make a difference, and what a difference this makes!"
You are absolutely welcomed! I 💜 Baby Lips and wouldn't trade it for the world! Glad it is helping you!!
"Yes, you should definitely see a doctor. There may be medicines you should be taking.  Each case it so different but health issues can become serious.  I'd see a rheumatologist (your primary dr. can probably refer you) so they can track your flares and overall health and prescribe what they think may be needed.  They will probably direct you from there on what other specialists to see if needed."

"I'd also be sure to keep good oral health, See your dentist regularly and see a real eye doctor to check for eye issues (Not just the eye glass people)."

Stay hydrated and look to eat a healthier type diet too.  Eating better has helped me with many health issues.
"I would definitely see a doctor.  I understand that not everyone's experience with doctors has been wonderful, but I feel like when you have a chronic illness like Sjogrens its important to find a care provider who can work with you as a team to manage your health.  Not only are there medications you can use to manage your pain and fatigue better, but also there are situations you should be avoiding."

"For example, all of the popular research that I had done recommended the use of ibuprofen for managing pain due to inflammation.  I was using it nearly daily because of my Sjogren-caused arthritis when my doctor warned me that the [FDA has recently strengthened their warning](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm451800.htm) that regular use of ibuprofen (and other NSAIDs) can increase your risk of heart attack or stroke.  She recommended that I switch to Tylenol arthritis for my joint pain management.  I have always been leery about Tylenol due to a family friend dying of liver damage due to Tylenol overuse, but according to my doctor as long as I am taking it AS DIRECTED and not going over the recommended dosage that the risk of damage is minimal. And if I take it and it doesn't work after an hour or so, as sometimes happens with specific joints of mine, I can always take an ibuprofen too to deal with the pain.  I've made the switch and am way better at managing my pain now that I have another tool in my toolbelt.  **Note that none of the above is medical advice, just an example of a way in which my doctor actively helped me manage my Sjogrens.**"

"Another reason I find my rheumatologist particularly invaluable is because she gives me good feedback on what is ""normal"" and abnormal pain and symptoms.  When I went to her I was complaining of pain in my knees and back, and she hunted those symptoms down, but she also noticed how knotty and swollen my hands were.  Yeah, my hands hurt a lot, but I was an engineer and worked with my hands every day. In my mind, of course they would hurt after the type of work I did. But it wasn't normal, and when we X-rayed and MRI'ed my hands we found that I had very low bone density (it was noticeable on the X-ray, which apparently isn't normal) and a lot of cartilage and even bone loss, which was causing arthritis.  I also had neuropathy (lost temperature and some pressure sensitivity in my fingertips), and had I continued working with my hands with no concern to the damage I was causing I would have been causing irreparable damage.  As it is I have arthritis and joint pain and have given up a lot of my former hobbies (adult coloring books, knitting) because it simply hurts too much."

"My point is that if your symptoms are mild you MIGHT be able to manage for a while, but you don't have to do this alone and you can't catch everything alone.  Bettering your lifestyle to avoid preventable issues is a great start, but you can't catch everything.  Even checking in with a specialized doctor once a year is better than never."
"If you have access to a university level teaching hospital, get established as a patient there."

"Sjogrens can manifest in many ways, and having all specialists within one organization can aid you."


Thank you 🙏
"Yep, a sugar daddy would be cool. He could also pay all my medical bills and help to fund all sorts of weird alternative healing methods that would cost a fortune. I know my plans for the future now. 💵"
it sucks some of the healthiest and maybe most effective ways to recover (functional med etc) is out of pocket and too expensive for some of us to access.
"OMG if you find one of those who has a clone, send me the clone's info please!!"
"ENT doc told me there are risks of complications, i.e. hitting a nerve.  He gave a few recent examples.  What would be the benefit as they are just treating the symptoms anyways?"
"Thanks to that biopsy I got a diagnose after trying to get it for about four years. The operation wasn’t bad but my lower lip was partly numb for about six months after it, now it’s back to normal. Also my lower lip got so swollen and it didn’t go back to normal as soon as it ”should have” so I had to eat an antibiotic just in case there might have been an infection. Anyways, I do recommend that if your blood tests continue to show nothing."
Didn't hurt but didn't prove definitive diagnosis. Doctor still treats me for Sjogren's. Don't recommend
It confirmed my diagnosis and sucked for a few days.  I was completely numb for the actual procedure.

"I also definitely feel like they nicked a nerve on mine.  My trumpet playing career ended over a decade ago, so it's not like matters, but I feel temperature on one spot of my outer lip when food/drink hits the location of the biopsy.  It really hasn't detrimented my life in the least and is basically just an interesting oddity."
"Mine didn't hurt much at all, did not rule out Sjogrens completely but Dr said its unlikely I have it based on lack of typical Sjogrens symptoms."
"My current and previous rheumatologist both have stopped recommending lip biopsies due to the risk of nerve damage. Instead, they look to symptoms and other blood work to diagnose patients who are anti-SSA/SSB and ANA negative. Since there is no FDA-approved systemic treatment yet, most treatment is symptom-specific or off-label anyway."

"I had a biopsy done and I was numb for the better part of a year. Even today, I have a small area that has less feeling than the surrounding nerves. I don't recommend it."

"If your doctor refuses to take your concerns seriously without a biopsy, it's time to look for a new doctor."
"I'm so sorry that many of you have had bad experiences with the biopsy! For me it was a godsent. My bloodwork was negative, and finally having a diagnosis and acces to restasis and punctum plugs was amazing. The procedure for me was quick and slightly oncomfortable and completely worth it."
"I had it done with a dentist and everything went great, got diagnosed thanks to it"
Had it done with reputable ENT since bloodwork was negative. I am positive for Sjogrens and really glad I went ahead with it to know for sure.
I had the lip biopsy last year and it was not bad at all.  The only problem I had is that my body did not like the suture material and the sutures fell out within 24 hrs.  The area healed perfectly fine with no scarring or numbness.

"I had abnormalities, but they were beneath the threshold for a DX of SS."
Benefit would be to get a diagnose if blood tests aren’t showing anything.
This was my thought as well. I just don't see the benefit. And my doctor is being very pushy about it. The whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth any time I think about it. Thanks for your reply.
"My blood tests were positive for several autoimmune disorders, not just sjogrens. I told the doctor I was fine with just that but he pushed me to schedule the lip biopsy & the eye test. My appt is this afternoon but I'm probably going to cancel. I'm an oral cancer survivor and I have no desire to be cut on again & risk nerve complications once again either. Been there done that got the tshirt. Thanks so much for your reply!"
"Diagnosis or not, they are treating the same symptoms.  Since there is no cure, the diagnosis doesn’t change the symptoms you’re experiencing."
If you yourself are not certain that you have sjögren’s then I really wouldn’t recommend for the lip biopsy. For me it was just that I KNEW I had it but I couldn’t prove it with my blood tests.

Also really understandable with your backround to not want to get more surgeries done in the mouth area. I can imagine it has been very dreadful dealing with an oral cancer.

"Edit: I accidentally read that your blood tests were not positive, I should correct my answer a bit because of that.😄"
Which AI diseases did you show pos. for?
"Exactly what I said to this doctor but he then gave some spiel so I caved. I'm being treated at a very prestigious university on the east coast since they're hq'd in my hometown but this is the second time in as many months I've been disappointed in their care. Feeling more like a lab rat or a means to meet some type of quota. Between the red flags my nagging intuition & the advice here, I don't think I'm getting this procedure done today or ever."

Thanks again!
Universities are very careful about diagnosing SS these days when they are in need of so many patients for SS research.  Researching/teaching hospitals have to be very careful about diagnostic criteria to make sure they have a valid cohort.
Are we looking at the same study? What you linked is from 1997 and says only 0.6% of the adult women in the study met the diagnostic criteria. What am I missing?
man acid reflux is a bum - it causes all sorts of issues! glad you've managed to get a bit more comfort now :)
"I use a product called XLear to keep my nose moisturized.    It is not going to cure a sinus infection, but helps with the dryness.  My ENT says you need to be careful to not overdo nasal rinses.  They also wash away the ""good"" mucous membrane stuff.  Good Luck"
Maybe try using a humidifier in the bedroom and anywhere else you spend a lot of time.
Were you exposed to the sun? Some people with Sjogren's are photosensitive which can cause or exacerbate some symptoms.

"For now, get the rest you need, hydrate and eat well. In the future, avoid the sun (spf lotion and/or spf clothes) if you are photosensitive."
"yup! this is currently a weekly thing for me, as I love practicing yoga to help keep me active in a more comforting way, but I've recently started going to a 90 minute ashtanga class on a tuesday night, and it honestly takes me until the weekend to recover, i just use up all my energy on it. going by the spoon theory, it uses all my spoons. i just try to allow more time around the classes to sleep and relax, have a bath etc to try and give my body as much of a chance to recover as possible. at some point though i think i'll have to rethink my attendance at this class."
Four miles? Why would you take such a big bite all at once?
"Same happens to me when I walk in the sun.  Strangely enough, I can run on the treadmill and exert far more energy and feel fabulous afterward.  Runners high, great energy, and all.  I run with a fan on me and 2 water bottles."

And sometimes I hit a wall for days for absolutely no reason other than that Sjögrens and Hashimotos stink!
On Saturday I was and actually got a small sunburn. My bad. Usually I'm better about spf. Do you know if spf protects against the flare?
"Yes, I'd re-think. It's not good to be so drained; you need the energy to repair damage being done to your poor self."
"If you are photosensitive, spf can protect against a flare by blocking uv light. http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/the-sun-and-sjogrens  Lotion and I like sun protective clothing from Coolibar. Sporting goods stores also have sun protective clothing. End of season sales are the best."

Other options are to exercise during not peak hours (before 10 am and after 2 pm) or indoors.
Thanks for the info. Being outside with my dog is just one of my favorite things ever but perhaps if I better prepare in the future I will have more luck. That being said I experience a lpt of fatigue from walking when it isn't sunny. I have a rheumy appt. spon and will def. speak to him about it more in detail as it's one of my worst symptoms. Last time I mentioned it he just kinda shrugged and logged post exertional fatigue into his computer.
"You're welcome! If fatigue without sun or exercise is one of your worst symptoms, you might want to have your vitamin D level checked. Also, plaquenil or modafinil (Provigil) might help if you are not already taking either. Here are more suggestions, though addressed to arthritis in this article, generally applicable to Sjogren's and other autoimmune disorders: https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/pain-management/fatigue/beat-fatigue.php"

"Good luck with your upcoming appointment. If fatigue is interfering with your quality of life or ability to do basic things despite taking reasonable measures to prevent it, definitely let him know again and don't let him brush it off. Ask if there's anything that could be causing it to rule out and treatment options. It's pretty common in autoimmune so he should have something to offer other than a shrug.  :)"
"I am on 200 mg of plaquenil once a day. I take 5,000 IU Vit D daily. He's the leading expert on Sjogren's at Penn Medicine and people travel really far to see him so yeah I need to advocate for myself better. Thanks again!"
Are you on Plaquenil? That stuff made my hair come out in CLUMPS. I actually stopped taking it because of that.
"For me, it's always been related to changing TSH levels due to Hashimoto's."
"I'm on Plaquenil and having hair loss. I was on 200 mg 2 times a day and my rheumy lowered the dose to 200 mg once a day. My hair has been falling out too to the point where I dread showers. No bald spots and no one else can tell. I do have very very thick hair but it's so distressing regardless because i can tell how much thinner it feels. I didn't know if the hair loss was due to Sjogrens, Plaquenil, or something else that is undiagnosed."
no but if this is a known side effect??

"i'd rather deal with the pain, omg.  that's terrible"
I've been on Plaquenil now for just under two months and I haven't noticed any hair loss yet. How soon did hair loss start for everyone?
"Yeah, that's the thing with autoimmune disease; so many of us have multiple diagnoses and so many conditions have overlapping symptoms. Some researchers question the idea that autoimmune issues are all as fragmented as we think they are. We need so much more research. So many autoimmune illnesses have undiscovered antibodies."
"Right, that's what confuses me. Is it the Plaquenil or is that Sjogren's!  200 mg sounds like a really low dose which is good"

"I had verrrrrrry thick hair but now not so much. I'm in my 30s.... So I wonder if it's more hormonal, like aga."
"Yep, it’s a reported side effect of Plaquenil. My hair is already thin to begin with, so yeah, I said ‘fuck it’ and just don’t take anything for my Sjögren’s. I just get pain and fatigue when I have flare ups anyway so for me it wasn’t worth it to stay on."
"It's not just pain; Plaquenil prevents antibodies from reaching receptors and can prevent progressive antibody damage. If you can otherwise tolerate it, you might want to carefully assess your priotity here."
No hair loss for me while on plaquenil.
For me it was at around 3-4 months
well eff that

I'm in the same boat.  I don't want to lose anymore hair.
"Does the hair come back after you come off of the Plaquenil, if you know?"
Are you taking vitamins? Sometimes a deficiency or too much of a certain vitamin can cause hair loss.
For me it did.
"I have a billion things..yeah, it could be hormonal/no ferritin.  I probably need a scalp biopsy for androgenetic alopecia (even though i don't have androgens, if anything they're too low)"
What about vitamin D? Low vitamin D levels and no ferritin is known to cause hair loss.
my vitamin d is good but my ferritin is god awful

i had so much bloodwork lately it's probably a 2

iron supplements jack up my stomach majorly but i don't qualify for iron infusions unfortunately.
"Have you tried FeraMax? It's the only iron supplement I can take, and the only side effect for me is dark green poop."
"Start cooking in iron skillets; that will help a lot. Um, what must your thyroid labs look like with your ferritin all messed up?"
I had misdiagnosed Giardia for two years and recently found out I have another pathogen! So most of my iron issues probably have to do with that :(. I'm going to take antibiotics and then try the iron after that.
"Took about a month for plaquinil to do anything. According to my doctor years of taking plaquinil in large doses will lead to eye damage, which is why you need to have your eyes checked twice a year. Also, during the first couple of weeks I was really sensitive to light."

"Here's what I do along with plaquinil (btw I live in a dry climate, so this could be overkill for you):"

Dry Mouth - switched to a lauryl sulphate free toothpaste

Dry Eyes - Retain Severe Dry eye drops in single use containers (eye drops with mineral oil).

"Dry Skin - Head and Shoulders dry scalp shampoo (or a sulphate free shampoo), a couple of drops of argan oil on the scalp. Cetaphil instead of soap. I only use soap on my armpits. Cetaphil lotion or Venicream. Aquaphore's good. Also, don't forget sunblock or a facial moisturizer with sunblock, not for Sjogren's I just think that people should wear sunblock."

"Joint Pain - Aleve & Borage Oil. Borage oil reduces inflammation, but please ignore any nut job web site or Facebook group that tells you it's just as good as prescription meds."

"Exercise - If you're having sleep issues get on a regular exercise schedule, it will help you fall asleep on time, but don't over do it or you'll have a flair up."

"Diet - I did a FODMAP elimination recently, turns out I can't handle beans, lentils or fructants/grains. Don't know if any off that applies to you. Also, can't eat acidic foods without causing a flair up. Basically, identify any food that can cause a flair up and then don't eat it."

Brain Fog - My sleep issues improved with plaquinil and that reduced the brain fog.

"Time Management/fatigue - It's okay to tell people that you can't do something or to leave early, it's better then a flair up. Plan breaks between activities/chores/errands."


"I started on it 5 months ago and have felt a huge difference. I barely have joint pain now and if I do, it only lasts for a day or so and Tylenol helps. My energy level is better and my hair doesn’t fall out as much. It hasn’t helped with the dry eye or mouth but I can’t image not being on it at this point."
It took about 6 weeks before I felt a difference and a solid 3 months before I really felt better on a day to day basis. It has helped with brain fog.
"The first week I had bad stomach pains but that was it. The second week I had terrible headaches but after 5 days, I was side effect free."
I went to the eye doctor the first week I was on it to get a base line of my eyes. I have to go every 6 months for them to check pressure or something.
Definitely give it a try

I was just at the dentist and I have 7 cavities in a year. I’ve only had 1 cavity before that. I’m trying a bunch of dry mouth mouth washes and tooth paste.
Yes. It definitely helps. I started on it because I was starting to have stiff fingers in the morning. Also I am tired all the time. It helped within 4 months with the joint pain- it's gone. The tiredness it did not seem to help. I am way more energetic these days but I attribute that to a very small dose of Prozac. 10 mg daily.
I'm starting it today.

"My rheumatologist said it does affect the retina, but it usually takes up to 5 years to affect peripheral vision, which will gradually close in. I'm hoping that in that amount of time that modern medicine will have given us another option."

"She said that it overwhelms Sjogren antibody receptors, so keeps the disease in check by preventing further damage. I guess that means my neuropathy won't get better, but won't get worse. Ugh, I hope it doesn't give me headaches; I feel I'm always on the verge of a migraine."

My take on brain lesions is that an active mind that keeps trying to learn new things/keeps making new neural connections can get around old lesions.
"For cavity prevention, ask your rheumatologist, dentist or GP for prescription Evoxac or Salagen. They are meds that help with saliva production. Saliva helps keep your teeth clean which prevents cavities."
"They're both really expensive though, unless you have really good insurance."
"I'm on plaquenil as well, and while I can't say how much it's helped, I haven't had any bad side effects from it either."

"Long term dental health is something I'm concerned about as well. You can't exactly sip water in your sleep and rinses can only do so much. I'm only 27 and have major issues with some of my teeth already, and at least minor damage to all of them. It really sucks, especially since even with dental insurance, it's very costly to fix failing teeth."
"I've done well with plaquinel, however my SLE and scleroderma symptoms are my main issues. With Sjogrens I've just got antibodies and dry eyes."

I've also had next to nothing in terms of side effects that I've noticed and many people have been on plaquinel for years with nothing notable while others can't tolerate it. YMMV.
Plaquenil didn't do anything for me and I didn't tolerate it well to begin with. I have had much better success with methotrexate and now leflunomine.
"I also have SLE and SS controlled by diet and supplements, with SJS dryness symptoms being my worst ones. /u/MercuriousPhantasm and /u/PancakeFritterdoodle, have you tried Salagen (generic is pilocarpine) or Cevemeline (generic is Evoxac) for dry mouth? They are prescriptions that help with saliva production. If one doesn't work, be sure to try another as they don't all work the same for everyone. You both mentioned concern for oral health. Note that saliva is also important for healthy digestive tract and digestion."

No input regarding plaquenil for SS because I only used it for SLE prior to being diagnosed with SS.
"I've been on plaquenil since my diagnosis a year ago. It took at least 3 months to notice an improvement, but it has helped."

"I still have occasional dry eye/mouth attacks that last for a few days, but it's no longer constant. Before plaquenil, I'd have bouts of fatigue bad enough that I'd fall asleep at work - I still have fatigue but it's minor in comparison. My general pain is improved too. I had migratory arthritis flares before that I needed braces and ice packs to get through - still have occasional joint aches or tenderness, but very rarely *pain*."

"My lacrimal glands are permanently enlarged and protruding since before plaquenil, that has not changed. My salivary glands didn't begin to swell until after plaquenil, so I don't know if the progression of that is slowed or not."
I just started 2 weeks ago.  I know it takes a while.
"Been on plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) for about two years. I generally have mild dryness symptoms (sleep with a humidifier and use biotene stuff), and more inflammatory symptoms like joint pain and fatigue. I am in a lot less pain and am more mobile now than I was two years ago. I've found it a little harder to lose weight, even though I diet and exercise. But, that's a small price to pay for everything else feeling better."
[deleted]
"I haven't tried it. My rheum and I think my dry mouth episodes are rare enough not to worry about it for now, but it's always something to keep in mind if things change in the future."
[deleted]
"I think I'm coming up on two years now. My dry eye and mouth symptoms are minimal, but my rheumatologist still recommends drops and rinses if my symptoms have a bad day and bother me. I still notice some level of pain just about every day, usually very tolerable, but it is better than what I remember before I was diagnosed."
[deleted]
"I would say my fatigue is ""average"" it's hard to gauge something like that just based on personal experience. I also have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) which also causes fatigue so I'm never certain where exactly it is coming from on a given day."

"My doctor never implied the Plaq might be stopped in the future so I would assume it's just something I will take forever now, just like my thyroid hormones. I will say that it's definitely doing me more good than harm. Just remember to have your yearly eye exam to make sure you are not getting deposits. Tell them specifically that you are taking it so they know what to look for."
"I have Raynaud's and livedo reticularis. I also have bulgy veins. Primary dx is lupus, but for SSA/SSB+ people they are essentially the same disease."
"I have vasculitis primarily in my legs from my feet to my thighs but it also can spread to my arms and hands. It has to be one of the most frustrating and problematic aspects of my SS. I take Plaquenil, flaxseed, fish oil and chia seed supplements. All that helps manage symptoms but flares can happen anytime."
"Been on plaquenil for a few months, and seems to be helping alot."
Are you familiar with Raynaud's syndrome?  It's a common disease associated with a number of AI issues.
"Flushing, according to my internet sleuthing because I don't have it myself, is common with SS and lupus."
I also found this:
"""Sjögren’s syndrome is also a rheumatic disease. These are diseases characterized by inflammation (signs include redness or heat, swelling, and symptoms such as pain) and loss of function of one or more connecting or supporting structures of the body. They especially affect joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and muscles."""
"I am 38f, I have diagnosed Sjogrens, Hashimotos disease and MS diagnosis in progress,"
"My Sjogrens causes excessive sweating,  hot skin,  clammy skin,  overheating. It's unpredictable and happens to me anytime day or night. I can be sitting on the sofa and break out in a sweat for no reason.  I have to have 2 fans blowing on me to help it or stick my head in a fridge. My long hair is always wet and so are my clothes.  I am told I look like I have ran a marathon.  Nothing seems to stop it. I have to stay calm also,  raising blood pressure, anxiety or even good types of excitement send it into overdrive, yet I can't produce tears :/ it also makes me dehydrated. As for skin,  mine always itches or is irritated like I have to scratch or pick at it. I can't wear tight fitting clothes very much and need light blankets. I have no rashes or breakouts, just the feeling of itchy. As a woman,  shaving is hard now,  skin seems more sensitive"
"Yeah, that is what my GP though it was at first.  But I don't get cold.  Just hot all over."
You ask a tough question. Lets just leave the answer up to fate!

*shakes like a polaroid picture*

**Are you trying to [confuse](/r/confuse) me?**
"OK Thanks.  He ran a million other tests, and they were all negative including Sed Rate, and CRP - normal."
I filled out your survey. :)
Done :)
Thank you!!
I use Act mouthwash for Dry Mouth (it has xylitol) and Spry gum is my favorite xylitol gum. Lots of water and Biotene gel if dryness is super bad. Having a humidifier in a room can help too over time.

"As for when my throat gets really sore, only two things really work for me: Throat Discs (taste like black licorice) and honey cough drops. I make my own honey drops because they are hard to find in stores without anything other than honey. Adding real honey to tea would be a simple equivalent."

"I also have medications that help. Pilocarpine works better for me, but I don't like the side effects so now I'm using cevimeline which doesn't work as well for me as pilocarpine, but much better tolerated."
"I can't use half the stuff out there because it does have fake sweeteners in it and my body can't hack them. Usually I resort to herb teas and honey when my throat hurts, really cold water. Try steaming for the chest cough. It helps. Also when your glands swell blue ice blocks wrapped in a thin towel can be your best friend. A few minutes with one of those off and on for a while can make a huge difference in how things go that way. Icing seems to really help mine. Also if you drink carbonated drinks get off them. I don't know what it is about those drinks but they made my SS so much worse. I think they just irritate already irritated tissues too much maybe, but I found that about 3/4 of my coughing stopped completely when I quit soda."
Thank you so much for the advice! I'm going to try all of those!
I don't drink soda or any carbonated drinks but I will definitely try the icing and steaming. Thanks for the advice!
I hope you find some relief. Good luck.
"I'm 34, currently a little over 12 weeks pregnant and have both antibodies. My rheumatologist has been pretty good about reassuring me that while there are increased risks, it's still pretty low.  The concern has been less about neonatal lupus and more about monitoring for fetal heart block. I'm honestly avoiding googling either for my own stress levels.  So far neither the OB I have spoken to or my rheumatologist have seemed worried at all.  Just more appointments."

"I don't have my appointment with maternal fetal medicine for another week and a half, but they did tell me I'll be scheduled to go to the children's hospital in Seattle for a fetal echo sometime in the nearish future."

"If you want to shoot me a pm in a couple of weeks, you are welcome to.  I will be honest and tell you that I will probably forget about this post to update later."
We are planning to get pregnant in the next few years and I'm terrified. Just wanted to reach out and tell you that you aren't alone :(
"Okay, so I had my maternal fetal medicine appointment today."

"The doctor I spoke to was very reassuring about the fact that the risk of neonatal lupus is about 2-4% in women with SSA antibodies.  However, since that's still higher than normal risk, they want to monitor very closely for any signs of fetal heart block which is a potential consequence of neonatal lupus."

"I think that they're going to have me do fetal echocardiograms every couple of weeks starting in about a month so they can just make sure that everything is developing normally.  It's not something that occurs suddenly, so periodic monitoring should catch it if anything starts to develop.  I'm also going to be seeing MFM every four weeks on top of my regular OB appointments every four weeks, so it's going to be, in the words of the doc, a hell of a lot of time in doctor's offices."

"They're also going to consult with my rheumatologist and see what she thinks about putting me on an anti-malarial/lupus medication, which may further reduce risk."

"All in all, I feel pretty fine about it.  It's more appointments than I expected and it's going to be an annoyance in terms of driving because the specialist stuff is an hour away from my small city."

"Disclaimers: My Sjogren's is super mild.  I basically have dry eyes and sometimes aches/fatigue.  That's about it.  Also, I have anxiety to the point that I take zoloft for it, but only over relatively small things.  I get zen in the face of big stuff, which drives my husband crazy - I will have a breakdown over not wanting to go to the movies but I had a cancer scare a few years ago and I was extremely calm.  So... I could be underreacting, but my husband was at the appointment, too, and he also seemed unworried."
I'm so glad to have stumbled across your post - I'm currently experiencing the same anxiety. I'm about to start Plaquenil as I have read studies indicating it reduces the (already small) risk.
"I went to see a doctor that manages high risk pregnancies, particularly those affected by auto-immune disease."

"I am not looking for a baby, but i wanted to know my options."

They said that Sjogren's poses no real threat to getting pregnancy or the baby. The other AI diseases I have do. My R.A. doctor said shes not as experienced with this stuff and that's why seeing someone who specializes in pregnancy and AI is important.
Wife is 34 diagnosed in her twenties has both antibodies we have had two children together (5 and 4) the severity of her sjogrens his medium not that it matters in the situation.

Anyhow for both pregnancies in addition to her normal OB doc we had regular visits with a neonatal cardiologist and another high risk Dr that increased in frequency along with the pregnancy duration.

The chances of issues from what we were told are small. However it is hard to not be concerned and I believe having doctors who are able to provide you with meaningful information and resources helps out a ton.

Something unrelated is on both pregnancies a lot of my wife's symptoms from Shogrens improved only to return right after birth
Hi there! I know your post is a bit old but I just found this sub and wanted to share my experience. My daughter had neonatal lupus and hydrocephalus (that we can only assume was related).

I found out I had a positive ANA when I was newly pregnant with my second child. She's 2 now. I was already considered high-risk as I'm a long term steroid user and my previous pregnancy ended with a c-section at 30 weeks. My primary autoimmune disease is dermatomyositis. I also have Raynauds and now Sjogrens.

"We did regular ultrasounds with a neonatal cardiologist starting at 20 weeks or so. I saw him bi-weekly for an ultrasound until 26 weeks, I think. They look for a heart block as that's the most common neonatal side effect. My daughters heart was fine."

"When she was around 4 weeks I started to notice red circular spots. They eventually got dark enough that at her 8 week appt, her doctor noticed. It looks a lot like ringworm. Me being me, had already done research on uncommon side effects and knew neonatal lupus was one. The spots never seemed to bother my daughter. No itching or upset from them. Even then she was a chill baby. The doc also noted that she was jumping percentiles in her head circumference. That's never a good sign. She had us back at 10 weeks to see if it was still jumping and it was. We went to the hospital for an ultrasound and they found fluid aka hydrocephalus."

We spent 4 days in the hospital where they made sure of her diagnosis and monitored to make sure the fluid wasn't increasing too quickly. It was for sure neonatal lupus. She didn't seem to be in any pain with the fluid or the spots. She was a happy smiling girl the whole time.

"We monitored her spots and hydrocephalus out-patient with a pediatric dermatologist, pediatric Rheumotologist, and a neurosurgeon."

"When she was 4 mo old, her neurosurgeon decided he didn't like how her head was continuing to grow and they did surgery. She did not need a shunt and instead had a Ventriculostomy. It's very noninvasive. She spent a few days in the PICU to recover."

I noticed soon after that her lupus spots were starting to fade and by 6 mo were completely gone. She is 2 now and just had a follow up MRI and is completely fine.

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm not on often so there may be a delay in response but I'll try to check occasionally.
Thank you. That makes me feel less concerned than I initially felt. I will message you in a few weeks.
Thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate it.
This is all incredibly helpful and reassuring. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond with the details. And congrats on the pregnancy!
My OB is going to start hassling my rheumatologist about putting me on that for at least part of the pregnancy.
"Hey, I just wanted to add that my OB mentioned today she has another patient with the same antibodies on her third (successful) pregnancy. :) I had my first fetal echocardiogram today and it was basically a long ultrasound. The biggest annoyance is that I have to drive an hour on I-5 every two weeks to get them.  It has been not-at-all scary."
It never hurts to get a second opinion if you can afford to do so. That was actually how my Sjogren's was diagnosed.

"It's manageable and like many other diseases range from mild to severe. I'm on the severe end and it's attacking my joints, but with medications and self care, I'm doing alright. They key is to have good communication with your doctors and don't be worried about asking them anything at all about your diagnosis."

"Xylitol is great for relieving dry mouth although it doesn't make saliva. You can find toothpastes, gum, mints, and mouthwash made for dry mouth with added xylitol. Stay away from alcohol based mouthwashes since it can have a drying effect. Visit a dentist regularly and let them know you have Sjogren's. Good dental hygiene is a must since Sjogren's can wreak havoc with our teeth."

An optometrist will be helpful regarding dry eyes if you develop that. Lubricate them often; many over the counter ones work fine. Stay away from ones that remove redness. You may also want to get single use ones that are preservative free.

"You can also ask your doc or visit a dermatologist to see about how best to deal with dry skin. The easy things are to use a moisturizer after a bath/shower, limit time in bath/shower, and keep the water warm or cooler, but not so cold you trigger the Raynaud's. And, if you have ever heard of Hothands warmers? They are great for Raynaud's, especially if you live in a cold wintery environment."

Feel free to PM me if you want to. I'm a 44F who was diagnosed about 7 years ago although I developed symptoms about 20 years before that. It took a long time for me to get diagnosed.
"I was diagnosis too.  34 y/o.  The only symptom that I get at the moment is dry skin.  I lather up with coconut oil immediately after my shower.  Yes, it's greasy but my skin drinks it up.  Then after 10-15 mins I apply body lotion and it does the trick.  I can seriously see a difference to that regimen as opposed to just body lotion if I'm in a hurry."

Good luck!  We are all in this together!
"Was diagnosed going on a year ago. 48m. For what it's worth, hasn't been too bad. By no means am I trying to diminish any worse experiences of others, though. Reading up on it lead me to fear worse than I have experienced so far. I went on plaquenil and have definitely seen some of the fatigue go away, and brain seems a little 'crisper.' Lots of vagueness around symptoms and what might be related versus what is just other stuff. But all in all not bad for me. Running a demanding business, play soccer and hockey, active generally. What downs I do feel are hard to differentiate between what might be SS versus what comes with being 48. Hopefully you will be annoyed and little more for a long time."

"Most docs say the earlier the diagnosis the better.  I think you're very fortunate to have been diagnosed at a young age.  I've had signs since 20 but as a man no one considered it.  Took 10 more years to get tested and by then a lot of damage to eyes and salivary glands was done.  Get into good habits now where your teeth and eyes are concerned.  Eye drops without preservatives are best but they are more expensive.  Get a good ultrasound toothbrush and keep a manual toothbrush at work.  Dental care is so expensive.  Ritual care is a necessary pain in the ass.  Stay away from anyone who promises a cure, but there's a lot of good info on Sjogren's websites.  Johns Hopkins is another good source.   Best of luck and like someone posted earlier, you're not walking alone, so ask questions. Most of us aren't medical experts, but many have good experiences to share, but do your homework.  Internet can be a blessing and a curse sometimes.  Everyone's experience with SS is a little bit different."
"You've received a lot of good information so far. I'll add a couple of things. Your rheumatologist or dentist can prescribe Salagen or Evoxac (both of which have generic versions) which are meds that help with saliva production. In addition to dental health, saliva is important for digesting food. Plaquenil can help alleviate or eliminate fatigue."

Sjogrensworld.org is another good resource.
"I also got it at 23, but wasn't diagnosed until 25. My mouth was extremely dry, went to see dentists, and an ENT...said nothing was wrong... flash forward to age 25 I noticed my hair was thinning quite a bit. This freaked me out. Got a blood test, sure enough got sjogren's. Took nioxin for my hair and it's back to normal :) But yes, I too am dry everywhere and have fatigue...but doing good :)"
"In addition to what you've mentioned, sjogren's can affect your joints, your organs (including your brain in very rare cases), and basically all moisture producing areas, so your whole body."
"Let's talk about vaginas.  My vagina is like a desert.  I had bacterial vaginosis repetitively and was at the doctor almost weekly for antibiotics.  She told me to use boric acid in my vajayjay to keep my girl nice and acidic.  I went to safeway and requested a jar of boric acid from the pharmacy, and went to a medical supply store to get size 00 empty pills.  Filled them up with boric acid and used them daily when vaginosis symptoms would arise.  then a few times a week, and then if it was good, it was good.  I also use organic coconut oil for lube, as the many lubes I've tried give me vaginosis.  They make liquid"
"(fractionated) coconut oil that works well.   As far as other things to worry about, just focus on and listen to your body.  If you have dry mouth and dry eyes, okay, address those.  Don't worry about what could happen, or go surfing around WebMD in fear, because everything on there is like ""you have cancer"" lol.  Just take it a day at a time and address symptoms as they come."
"I agree, second opinions are good:). I've gone the alternative medicine route, because the Meds available kind of scare me ( I used to work in the pharma industry, so I have a different perspective). So, I make sure I drink loads of water and herbal teas, eat plenty of healthy fats ( I have the dry everything issue. I itch therefore I am :) ), use olive oil based soaps as they are extra moisturizing, spend the extra money on really good skin care products ( the ones from Lush are great and the people there will help you find the best ones for you). I eat a lower carb/anti inflammatory diet ( mostly paleo on the recommendation of my rheumatologist) and practice lots of self care. And don't forget to exercise! Low impact things like walking, yoga, Pilates and swimming help keep your joints moving without adding loads of extra stress."

"For supplements I take : evening primrose oil, cod liver oil, magnesium, Vitex Elixir and Zyflamend. When the pain gets bad, I have a marijuana infused  salve that I use."
"p.s. always have water with you.  This greatly helps decrease chances of cavities, in addition to very good oral hygiene.  swishing coconut oil  for 10-20 mins is very beneficial in saliva production and moisturizing and sterilizing the mouth.  Refresh tears eyedrops are spendy but so worth it.  If you go with restasis (Rx only) thats also awesome for some people, myself included.  Drink a lot of water, avoid stress, eat healthy and clean, get plenty of rest, and take care of yourself first."

"My friend makes it for me. I don't have a medical card, so I kind of get it on the down low :). But make Rosemary Gladstar's regular salve, and add some marajuana to there Herb mixture that you infuse in the oil. I would start with small amounts and test till you get the right mix for you!"
I am a young person. I was diagnosed two years ago at 24 years old. I'm not male. It does seem strange when I go to the Rheumatologist and every other patient is at least 30 years older than me.
"PS, you are definitely not alone!!!"
"I am not sure precisely what you mean by young, but I am a male and was diagnosed two years ago in my early 30s, which I consider to be far too young to have an autoimmune disease. I understand feeling along as you try to work through what SS means for your life."

I created a personal blog [whatyousjo.com](http://www.whatyousjo.com) to share my own story and the research I have found - feel free to peruse it. You can also contact me through my site if you would like to talk.
I'm 35- dxed two years ago but know people who are younger. There are males and young people in the SS alternative therapy group on Facebook. How old are you?
"you're not alone! I was diagnosed when I was 11. I am female, but I really understand."

"There is a group on facebook called ""under 40 with Sjogren's."" Check it out. Lots of good people."

How are you doing? Recently diagnosed? Any questions? I am now 26 so I've been living with it for a while!
"Not male, but I was diagnosed about 14 months ago when I was 18. Not an easy thing to deal with :("
Diagnosed two days ago with SS at the age of 32/f. But I was feeling symptoms in 2007 (dry eye).
"Diagnosed today, but been having symptoms for ~10 years. 27/f"
"Diagnosed this year, 25/f"
I'm a 25 y.o. male.

"I've had many symptoms: daily fatigue, muscular pain, dryness, etc. and some blood findings, but not a label yet."

"I know exactly what you're going through. Many, many doctors made me feel isolated because they somehow took my pain less seriously because of my age."

"Something I would recommend if you haven't taken it seriously already: Exercise makes a very big difference for me. With it, I get by (although still many symptoms). Without it, I wouldn't be able to function."

"I only say this because when it was first suggested to me, I thought they were crazy for thinking I could exercise with the pain I had. Sure enough, it does help tremendously."

"I wasn't ever actually ""diagnosed"", but through a dentist who specialized in saliva production and noticed that I produced none, told me I probably had Sjogren's at around age 14. Playing baseball growing up I never understood how the other kids could spit so much. I'm currently 23. Within the last 6 months my Evoxac has stopped working. Been getting sick all of the time and I'm thinking it has to do with all of the canker sores acting as doorways for infection. You're definitely not alone though, I'm looking to get reevaluated in the next few weeks to see if anything has changed."
"Female and almost 25, haven't been formally diagnosed since I don't want to do the lip biopsy but everyone's pretty sure it's Sjogrens. I've had symptoms for the past two years."
"I'm 26, however female. I have had sjogrens since I was about 23, but wasn't diagnosed until this past year. You're not alone!"
"Hi whatyousjo, have met you on the sjogren's world website. Thanks."

:(
"I've seen Fluconazole (oral med)used vaginally in some of the Sjs pts, but run that by an MD before you do it."
I take an acidophilus supplement daily and it's really helped. I started doing this about a year before my diagnosis and wish I'd started doing it long before. Have you tried a daily supplement?

"I only use Diflucan when I take antibiotics and it's really great, though for a 10 day course of antibiotics, I'll need 5 or 6 doses to keep it in check. Still, it helps like no other treatment I've tried. I avoid antibiotics at all costs for this reason alone."
I have dryness issues. I'm in my late 20s and have to use lube every time unfortunately. I know there's a prescription now if you have chronic dryness.

"I'm not sure about the yeast infections, it's possible that your same one was never cured. I personally can't use monistat products- I have no idea if that's related to sjogrens or not but the dryness can cause irritation, so I get diflucan."
I'll ask about that. Thanks!
That stuff has been a godsend to me. It really works.
"Thanks, both of you. Today rheumatologist responded to my message that swelling was present. She is putting me on a short course of Medrol. I have never been so happy to get prescribed steroids in my life."

"Hubby spent a good part of last night reading over anti inflammatory/autoimmune diet info with me to help me get on track with my diet. I'm hoping these two things, in conjunction with the continuation of gabapentin will help my pain."

"I understand now why Dr House was always such a jerk. Not that my pain level is necessarily the same as his, but jeez, after a long enough time, you just can't keep up the ray of sunshine facade that society prefers."
"I'm sorry. :( I've had some serious joint pain, but I don't think it's the same as what you're dealing with. I have no idea what to suggest for the doctors. My sis also has multiple auto immune problems and she did the dr merry-go-round including two hospital stays and they really did nothing to help or find any answers. I don't have insurance so I have only see a couple of doctors who haven't been terribly helpful. The only suggestion I can even think of for the joint pain is to try some dietary changes. I had to go off gluten do to intestinal problems and as a side effect my joint pain got better. Turns out there's a pretty high co-morbidity with SS and Chron's and other digestive problems. Hopefully someone else will have some better ideas. *gentle hugs*"
"I'm so sorry you have been dealing with uneducated people.  This happens so much now that autoimmunity is on the rise.  Doctors know very little and it is up to us patients to figure out the clues and piece them together for them.  I can tell you how many doctors I have educated on my diseases.  So, let me begin by addressing that ""cotton"" feeling in the joints. I had to think about what that would feel like and I 'think' i know what you mean.  I would say it is inflammation of the joint.  It will usually feel warm to the touch too."
"What I suggest you do, keep a daily journal on what you are feeling that day.  Do the pain scale 1 being nothing, 10 being the worst.  Do this for each joint that is hurting that day.  Make an appointment with a rheumatologist in a teaching hospital, or like where I travel to Cleveland clinic.  I have even seen a doctor in Cleveland clinic that rolled her eyes at me and said I was crazy.  However this was not my regular rhuemy but I saw her because she had an opening sooner.  I just was lucky that I got to see the head of rheumatology at Cleveland clinic.  With dry eyes...I would pursue the sjogrens diagnosis unless you find a good doctor you are comfortable with that tells you otherwise. Only you know your body the best, if what a doctor says makes no sense what so ever, say your thank yous and find the right answer.  You deserve the best care. Don't give up!  Also in your daily notes make sure to take your temp!  If you have any questions just send me a message.  Or if you need help or just need to rant, believe me...I know how valuable a non-judging ear can be."
"Oh yes, keeping a good temperament is very difficult. I think you'll find the diet very helpful with your overall health."
"Thank you for your response. Yes, I have promised myself to get back to healthier habits. I can be very disciplined if I want to, but I got so frustrated last year that I quit trying to be positive. Stopped watching my diet, which is usually pretty clean and balanced. I know I need to get back to a lean meats and veggies diet. I definitely need to cut out the drinking but that is tough bc it feels like a treat plus it helps me forget my issues and socialize. I did go through a bout of perioral dermatitis and had to cut sugar and SLS toothpaste. It helped with face issue. I will be buying stevia and getting back to this habit also."

Thanks again for being a forum where I can talk to others about what I am going through and get some supportive encouraging talk from people who know about this stuff.
Biotin supplement really helped me
Pity the biotin didn’t work for you. All sorts of bad side effects from taking steroids for ant length of time. Ok for a short period but won’t help hair loss.
"I use Ovation leave in conditioner once or twice a week after I wash my hair. It really helps with hair growth, though not so much with hair loss. I go through periods of hair loss and the ovation helps balance it out and moisturizes my scalp to the max."
Bleh.  Makes me break out like crazy.  I was wondering if anyone had been helped by going on a low-dose steroid for a bit.  Like prednisone.
"That is what I've heard, but I had to be on prednisone a few years ago after having a total-body rash.  I was only on it for a few days, but it kind of rebooted my system and helped me go into remission (which I was in for almost three years, and it was very awesome to live an almost normal life)."
Prednisone would handle the skin symptoms that lead to hair loss but won't do much for new hair growth.
It certainly helps short term. It’s like a little miracle. I’ve had it for asthma and bad rashes and RA flairs. . Nothing else works like it. Unfortunately it’s very bad for the bones and bloating among other things if you have to take it for any length of time
Facebook has much better Sjogrens groups
I did not know one could get corneal burns from lights. Which of your conditions is that a symptom of?
"Thanks, good to know! I'm on a mix of FB groups and Reddit groups for my various medical conditions, so I just tried here 1st. I'll join one of the SS groups on FB."
"Thanks, that's a good question. According to my ophthalmologist, the corneal burns and my eyes' inability to tolerate any kind of light could be Sjogren's, Wegener's, my mast cell disease, or a combination of several of those. I was already light sensitive, since childhood, because of my mast cell disease and my migraine history. Have always preferred low lights and of a warm tone, and have had screen filters on my devices for years (Twilight for Android, f.lux for Windows). But this recent uptick in my light sensitivity is totally new, especially to be this severe. And at the same time I have dry mouth and severe dry eye, fatigue, and lots of neuralgia (occipital, trigeminal, etc.). So some of those symptoms point to SS. Also, my rosacea has been flaring, and my rheum has interpreted that to possibly be a lupus rash, aka butterfly rash. I saw my dermatologist this past Mon., and she said I could have rosacea and lupus, or just rosacea, and that there's no way to know just by looking at the redness, and that a biopsy of the red skin (as my rheum had suggested) wouldn't necessarily tell us whether it was lupus, rosacea, or both. It seems like getting diagnosed will be really complicated because I already live with a lot of other diseases."
"Gosh, that’s a lot going on. I imagine you’ve had ANA testing done that may rule out lupus, although you may have a positive ANA due to your other conditions. There are specific blood tests for SS, but they are not 100%. You may need a lip biopsy for that."

"But a lot of conditions cause dry eye and/or mouth, as well as a lot of meds. Is there any specific reason you suspect SS?"
"Wow, yeah, you have a lot going on. A couple of things that might help:"

1. Do a search for side shield sunglasses or sunglasses with side coverage. I think that type of sunglasses could help a bit.
"2. Topical treatment (lotion or ointment) can help clear up the skin rosacea which might help rule out the lupus. Also, I got rosacea for the first time last winter and shortly thereafter my eye dryness got worse.  When I went to the ophthalmologist, I didn't mention the rosacea because why would I, and anyway it had cleared up by then. Much to my surprise, the doctor asked if I had recently had skin issues. When I said rosacea, she said optical rosacea can occur around the same time or soon after dermatologic rosacea. Who knew?!. The treatment for that was steroid drops four times per day."
"3. If you are off all medications that cause dryness and your mouth is still dry, ask your rheumatologist about prescription saliva production medications Salagen and Evoxac. They both have generic equivalents. If one doesn't work well or suit you, try another. In the meantime, there is a decent selection of over-the-counter remedies that can provide temporary relief."
"Thanks, yeah, I've had a lot going on since 2014, when I was diagnosed with endometriosis...for which I had had symptoms since I was a teenager. And then in 2015 I had an upper respiratory infection that caused my mast cell disease to progress, and life hasn't been the same since then."

"My docs suspect Sjogren's because I've been on lots of drying medications for many years, but I've never had severe dry eyes and dry mouth and light sensitivity like I have recently developed (severe dry eye & light sensitivity since July, dry mouth started about 10 days ago). My rheum suspects lupus + SS because a little over a year ago I tested positive for antiphospholipid syndrome for about 6 months, and people with lupus often test positive for antiphospholipid syndrome. I no longer test positive for antiphospholipid syndrome, but rheum told me that the antiphospholipid syndrome marker can fluctuate in a person with lupus. So some symptoms are very new and severe and that's why they suspect lupus and SS. My ophthalmologist thinks it could also be Wegener's, since I've tested positive for that for 18 months. Wegener's can manifest systemically or in a limited region, such as the eyes. For some Wegener's patients, their disease initially presents in their eyes. So several diseases could be affecting my eyes."

"I want to get a t-shirt that says, ""I'm a living example of inbreeding."" I recently spoke to my father and he admitted that he considers the kinds of marriages that happened on my mother's side of the family (marrying 1st cousins) to be inbreeding. I don't think he realized decades ago when he married my mother that her genetics from those consanguineous marriages would cause a lot of medical problems for his children. I live with more diseases than my sister, but we both have a lot of unusual health challenges."

It's good I never had kids! I wouldn't want to pass on these genes! 😆
Thanks for sharing all that info.

"Regarding rosacea, I was diagnosed with ocular rosacea (rosacea on the eyes) almost 2 yes ago. For me, my ocular rosacea mainly manifests as a pink or red eyelid and blepharitis, which is red bumps along the edge of the eyelid, where the lashes' roots are. It causes a little dry eye but not much compared to my other conditions and medications. When my facial rosacea flares (which changes every day) I don't experience a flare in dry eye. I think every rosacea patient has a different pattern."

"Regarding medications that cause dry eye, many of my meds do. Some of my meds are lifetime drugs (like my H1 & H2 blockers, which are for my mast cell disease), so I'll never go off them (I tried that last spring and my mast cell disease had a field day...very dangerous). But I've been taking high doses of H1/H2 blockers (which are 2 types of antihistamines) for several years and they have never caused the level of dry eye, dry mouth, and severe light sensitivity that I'm having right now. Prior to July I had never had a corneal burn."

"It's possible the corneal burn is due to Wegener's, not Sjogren's. That's what my rheum has to figure out."

"Regarding rosacea medication, that's a good point. If the meds help clear up the redness, then the redness is clearly rosacea and not lupus. I'll talk to my rheum about that. This past Mon. when I saw my seem, she recommended low-dose doxycycline for the rosacea."

Thanks again!
"Other than dryer eyes than usual, i didn't notice any other ocular rosacea symptoms. So glad my ophthalmologist was smart enough to figure it out."

"I feel for you having to take antihistamines. They are so drying that I can't even take them for seasonal allergies anymore. Your condition is more serious than seasonal allergies, so if that's the best option for you than I guess that what you have to do."

"My dermatologist prescribed Pimecrolimus cream or metronidazole cream for the facial rosacea and I was pleasantly surprised it cleared up within a few weeks. I'm not sure which because I have both here and the doctor diagnosed me with two conditions. I forget what the other one was so I don't know which cream was for which. Anyway, we used that as the first line of treatment in an effort to avoid antibiotics as I get a YI within 45 minutes of taking them."

I hope you get some answers and effective treatment for all that ails you soon.
"Thank you! Yeah, the high dose antihistamines are necessary to keep me out of the ER. This past spring one of my immunologist's staff (PA) suggested I try going off my antihistamines, to see if Xolair (a biologic injection I get every month for the mast cell disease) has taken over their role in suppressing the mast cell disease. After 2 weeks of this 'experiment' I had loads of symptoms like gum swelling in reaction to everything I ate, hives on my tongue, throat swelling, and significant neurological problems (insomnia, 24/7 jitteriness, and trouble concentrating). So the high dose antihistamines suck, but having mast cell reactions 24/7 is way worse, so it's a worthwhile compromise. 😁"

"Regarding metronidazole, do you know if that addresses rosacea redness, or does it just help with the bumps/pustules...or both? I can't remember. To rule out lupus, I'd need metronidazole to reduce the rosacea redness. I actually have a tube of it, I just haven't started it yet."

"Regarding glasses, which you mentioned above, I'm going to buy some that completely cover my eyes, so no light can reach them. I found them on a website that sells dry eye products."

Thanks again. Hopefully I'll have an upbeat update in the near future.🤞🏽
"Yikes, that MCAS is serious stuff!  The cream completely got rid of the rosacea. I've had a clear face for months now. I hope the glasses work well for you. Fingers crossed for upbeat update, indeed!"
"That's great to know, that the cream helped the rosacea! I mainly have redness & it's pretty random as to when I get bumps/pustules, so if the cream can help either of those I'll be happy. Thank you, I'm hopeful about the glasses too. And thanks for the fingers crossed! 😊"
"Not exactly but I’m having some other strange health issues and in trying to find out what may be wrong, I’ve noticed D. Insipidus fits many of my symptoms."

"I don’t consider that I necessarily get overly thirsty, but I always have a drink on hand. I take one in the car when I pick up my kid from school, carry one on my purse when I go out, & I take sips throughout the night from my bedside glass if/when I wake up."

"Can I ask, about how much do you drink a day?"

And do you urinate a lot at night?  Does it almost seem like you urinate more than you drink?

What are your symptoms?
"Perhaps mistaking dry mouth for thirst.  Are you doing anything other than drinking water to alleviate your dry mouth symptom? Maybe if your mouth wasn't so dry, you wouldn't feel the need to drink water. Dry mouth mouthwash, dry mouth lozenges, mouth spray, sugar free gum or sugar free candy, humidifier, prescription saliva production medication Salagen and Evoxac and their generic equivalents, pilocarpine and cevimeline, respectively."
"The first time I tried Biotene toothpaste, my water-drinking went down immediate. Not thirsty, dry mouth! I agree with the other suggestions about moisturizing your mouth as much as possible throughout the day. There are many brands of xylitol lozenges, gums, mints, etc. to try to find your favorite. I suggest switching to a dry mouth toothpaste, oral rinse if you want, or even spray. It’s possible something else is going on, but the oral care won’t hurt. Wishing you the best!"
"I know that Sjogrens can affect your nervous system (brain and spinal cord). This might sound strange but I don't really think that I feel thirsty any more. I don't have confirmed Sjogrens but I have SLE and MGD in my eyes that seems to be related. Sometimes my mouth is extremely dry and I drink water and it is like it goes straight through me, it seems to be associated with a weird eye headache in me and thank goodness it is not all of the time."

"I have done some research on DI there is neurogenic (hypothalamus/pituitary in your brain usually) and nephrogenic (kidney). It can be caused by antibodies in some reports which can associate with autoimmune illnesses. Hopefully you get to the bottom of it, the doctor's seem like they are listening which is good!"
"I drink a gallon of water daily, not counting tea & other liquids.  My family is annoyed big time by the amount of water I go through.  I pee constantly too.  When eating something like crackers, I require water to wash them down or they get ""stuck"".  Not diagnosed with Sjogren's but starting to think it's a possibility."

"I always thought of diabetes causing actual thirst...as in, a strong craving for water.  I don't have that--I just have to drink that much to avoid getting a UTI or having stomach pain (I have chronic gastritis & water seems to wash things down easier)."
"I figure I drink 8 - 9 litres on the average day made up of about 3 LARGE cups of coffee, a large cup of herbal tea, and the rest is water.  I have a water bottle with markings so it's easy to keep track of how often I've filled it.  I also boil my water in my 1.7 litre kettle -- Raynaud's Disease, so my beverage must be warm."

"Occasionally, I notice extreme thirst in the afternoon and I'll go through ~ 3 litres of water in a couple hours.  On those days, my fluid intake is probably well over 10 litres."

"When I mentioned this to my general physician and rheumatologist, they were both stunned when I told them I've consumed 3 litres by mid-morning.  ""You keep drinking after 3 litres? Yes, that's alot!"""

"I urinate about three times the volume that is considered normal.  Yep, occasionally wake up to urinate two times in the night."

"Not too many troublesome symptoms thank goodness.  I feel thirsty, I get occasional headaches that are usually taken care of with a painkiller.  I get occasional insomnia but I think that's more stress-related.  I've noticed increased bloating and motility issues in recent months; that's probably as troublesome as things get."

I have an MRI scheduled for 6 months from now to see if there might be something going on in the brain that's causing my excessive thirst/urination.  I had a kidney ultrasound done recently and that came back normal.
"Thank you so much for the suggestions! Sometimes I do find myself going through a pack of gum in no time flat -- I chew it up, it gets too solid, I spit it out and onto the next piece in minutes.  Hmmm ... Dry mouth? Never put two and two together."

"Do you have experience using those products you suggested?  About how much time will it take for me to notice a change (and thus drink less water) if dry mouth is indeed the cause?  For example, if I started using the mouthwash, could I expect my mouth to feel more ""hydrated"" after a week? A month?"
Oh wow. I will try out the Biotene. Thanks for the suggestions!
My rheumatologist has me scheduled for an MRI to check that the nervous system is looking okay.  Nephrologist visit is next week.   I'm glad your thirstiness is gone. Thanks for sharing your experience.
"Haha yea my family would get annoyed at me drinking all the water too.  We always kept a large thermos of hot water for tea etc, and I kept it empty most of the time."

"The ""stuck"" thing with food sounds like what I hear a lot of Sjogrens patients describe."
Well good luck to you.  I hope they find what’s causing your thirst and are able to easily treat it!

"I don’t drink as much as you but I feel like what I do drink just goes straight through me, and that it almost seems I urinate more fluid than I take in.    I have almost like flare times when I urinate like 10 times a night (not UTI)."

"It’s just frustrating. I have Lupus too so it may have something to do with that but I always thought my Sjogrens caused more problems, and that my internal moisture was just kind of off... feel dehydrated when I’m not, don’t sweat sometimes, etc."
"Not OP, but I had what turned out to be excessive thirst from dry mouth. As soon as I went on prescription cevimeline the relief was within 20 mins. I was fully prepared for the dry mouth to take 2 weeks or more to improve after reading the prescription insert but when my mouth started watering at 15-20 mins after taking the first capsule I wanted to cry with relief."

It took having a “normal” level of moisture in my mouth/throat to realize how bad I had it prior to the medication. I was drinking something like 2 gallons of water a day and all my symptoms were the same as what you wrote. That could have been written by me!

Another thing I did that helped tremendously is that I went on the Autoimmune Protocol elimination diet over a year ago. That helped some of my other Sjögren’s symptoms.
"Dang.  Well, a big chunk of my molar fell out last night so that seals it.  I need to do something about figuring this out or risk going insane, lol.  Ugh."

A good thermos is a must :)
"Thank you, same to you.  I understand the frustration ...not too sure what's going on, what's causing what and so not knowing how to treat it.  Hope you get some relief soon!"
Thanks for sharing this. Glad to hear you found relief.
I’ve been on plaquenil for 9 years and I haven’t noticed anything with my cycle. However I didn’t have an IUD when I started. Hopefully someone else can shed some light if they have an IUD.

And don’t worry about TMI. This community is here for all kinds of questions!
"I haven't noticed any issues with spotting while on Plaquenil. I did spot before I took it, though. I started oral birth control around the same time as plaquenil. Haven't had issues with spotting since starting birth control."
"I'm also on plaquenil and had my nexplanon replaced which I started to spot after the change, which is common due to the influx of hormones from the new implant. Then I was having heavier bleeding and horrible cramps. I found some information about taking magnesium supplements and in a day or two of taking it I haven't spotted since. The ones I take recommend 2 pills 1-2x per day. I take 1 every other day now."

Though don't know if the plaquenil played any role in my issue.
I hope so! Thank you!!
"Awesome! Lord, my body is so messed up right now that there's no telling what's causing it😂"
U may have neuropathy I’d get the lip biopsy done by familiar plastic surgeoun not an ent to avoid nerve damage. I have the skin issues too. Breathing problems went away with Low dose naltrexone
"I have knee pain, I have to keep my knees covered because of the slightest little bit of cold causes pain. It is to the point that I can’t wear dresses anymore unless I wear leggings under them. My doctor told me that I have Raynaud's in my knees. It is not common but it can happen. I don’t know if that’s what you’re experiencing but I thought I would throw it out there. And I’ll be praying for you."
"They discolor. Not sure I would say purple but definitely not normal. It is not common to have in  the knees but not unheard of, and I think Sjögrens might be a factor."
"Yes! This! Me! Except also on my hands so much that I almost don't have finger prints anymore. I and my doc ate assuming it's the Sjogrens, because when that is flaring up I have other symptoms going as well (for me it's mouth, teeth, eyes, glands, joints and fascia, etc.)"

"I'm so glad you brought it up because I feel like it's something that's overlooked or the response is just 'put some lotion on it.' It's not minor though! My dermatologist explained years ago that it has too much inflammation to be treated by anything normal. Sometimes it takes prescriptions but even those fail. I do better when I'm on to of starting extra hydrated. I think my skin areas also did better when I was on plaquenil, but I'm off it now and it is much worse. I can't run my hands over certain clothes without it getting caught like Velcro. My rheumatologist said to go back to the dermatologist."
"That's basically what she does. She keeps track of my numbers to see how my inflammation and how autoimmune activity is doing and then she refers me places for specific problems. I also have a mysterious knee and other joint/tendon problems and she's helped with those a great deal, since that's their specialty. It's helped a lot to track how active things are. I think you can generally see one without a referral, but I'm sure it depends."

"I'm so sorry for all your other health problems. It's difficult to have that stacked on top of each other like that I'm sure. Sending good vibes your way and I wish you luck! Hearing your story helps to me feel a little more validated with all the random difficult things I experience. I'm glad this subreddit to is filled with people who understand. I'm sorry for what you're going through, but you're not alone! Thanks again for sharing your experience."
Who tested you?
"I will ask my doctor about this. Since I have an HMO, I need referrals for everything."
Thank you. I didn't know you can have Raynaud's in your knees. Do they turn purple? I'm pretty fair skinned and mine do!

"If I'm at work, I'll use a heating pad on my knee (I keep heating pads everywhere for my always cold feet) but that was just instinctive because ice has always made my pain worse."

Lately I've been trying to get away with wearing leggings to work. They keep my legs warmer than regular pants.
Thank you! I don't feel so alone now. I have had peeling hands too but not as bad and only a few times.

I made an appointment with my primary care doctor and I will keep the peeling skin on my list.

I have an HMO so I need a referral to see a specialist. She's really good about giving me referrals so I'm not too worried. My husband sees an out-of-network rheumatologist who I like so he's an option too.
Two different primary care doctors ordered the blood tests that came back negative.
Ugh and they may not know but to be tested properly for neuropathy you need skin biopsy and autonomic neuropathy which I also have you need to see an autonomic neurologist and there are prob only a handful in US. A regular neurologist that will do biopsy may be fine. Rheumy think they know everything about sjogrens and miss it dowplay neuro component. So just consider these people tools in ur tool box 😂nobody I have found has all the answers and I have to push. Then or fire them if they get me nowhere good luck also low dose naltrexone has lessened my symptoms not as much as I hoped but it’s enough I never want to be off it.
Best wishes for all that and hope it helps. You can do it!!
Go to a rheumatologist they know what to look for! I was getting tested at my endocrinologist for all autoimmune tests because I had a positive ANA and she couldn’t find anything and I thought it was Sjögrens for years but never mentioned it until I saw the rheumatologist. Then I was diagnosed with it!!
Thank you!
"I'm really hoping to get a referral next week when I see my PCP. If not, I will pay cash to see an out-of-network rheumatologist."
I hope it works out! ❤️
"Sometimes the lip biopsy can be a false negative. I’ve been told to try to get an ultrasound of the salivary glands. Maybe look into that? Regardless of what the blood work or biopsy says, if Plaquenil starts helping you, I’d just never stop taking it! Do what works!"
"Look up bladder spasms and renal acidosis. Do you make kidney stones? It’s related to sjogrens. Your symptoms are almost identical to mine, and I have very very high antibodies."

I take ditropan for the painful ruination. Changed my life.

"Edit I wasn’t clear, i do have sjogrens and test very highly positive for it. Ana is 1:1250, RF of 13"
I have most of the same symptoms as you. Is it possible for you to get a second opinion?
"I am diagnosed with Söjgrins and OMG the unexplained abdominal pain! Yeah that, what they said! Yes, there IS something going on in my abdomen, what it is I don't know, some days I look 6 months pregnant, other days only a flabby belly. I for 30 years have had these pains maybe once or twice a month, other times it can go 4 month without this one pain. I feel like I'm being stabbed, the first time they thought it was appendicitis, till they scanned me. Everything was normal. (I just realized it has been that many years. Holy crap.). I get all kinds of pains, some up high, by my diaphragm, and having gone through menopause, all of a sudden I'm getting cramps like I'm going to start.  Being sick all the time just stinks.  I hope they can figure you out. And make things easier for you."
Lip was negative.  It did show some inflammatory cells. But not much

Ultrasound of salavitory glands was positive.

Ana speckled 1:640
What does a positive ultrasound show? Inflammation? Scar tissue? Just curious what they look for.
"stopped doing biopsies in my country as its so hard to get the right spot, its just luck if they hit a cluster or not. My rheumatologist ordered my ultrasound, i would ask your consultant thats dealing with your case, it should be straightforward to arrange one"
"I don’t have any dry mouth symptoms (dry eyes only) and my lip biopsy was still positive for Sjogrens. So, just anecdotally, I don’t think it’s related to the symptom location, it is testing for some sort of gland inflammation."
"You can be SS negative and still have Sjrogrens, which is why my neuro wanted me to do the lip biopsy. Mine actually came back completely normal (so I do not have SS) but I was glad to know the glands were ok and nothing else was seen. Hope you get some answers soon!"
"Mine came back negative.  Doc stopped looking.  Years and many problems later a. Different doc did ultrasound of cheeks and thyroid.  Lots of damage.  Yea. It’s Sjögren, or something very close."

"Thank you. I’m seeing my rheumatologist this week, so hopefully he’ll know where I need to go."
Just curious--what country do you live in?
"I don’t. I was tested again last week, so we’ll see what if my blood work has changed. My doc already diagnosed me based on symptoms, and he doesn’t like doing lip biopsies and doesn’t want me to do it. I just feel very uncomfortable taking immunosuppressants without some proof. I do have several symptoms and have for years, so I probably have it. But I get bad side effects from medications sometimes and am not really comfortable with his approach of wanting to treat me without proof."
"Don't give up, the whole process can take a while and can be frustrating , maybe mention IgG4 to him or her also. Best of luck"

"Every orifice dried up within the last 2/3 years. I had peripheral neuropathy problems, and foot drop, when I was younger, and parotid swelling off and on, but no one ever knew what was wrong with me and I was just sent to a neurologist who wrote it off and told me not to worry about it. I’ve had raynauds since middle school. I would like to think that the incidents when I was younger were a fluke, and that the beginnings of perimenopause brought on all my dryness issues (I’m 38). I just had a fear that everything might be related, which sent me to the rheumatologist."
Any association of how much sun you get and symptoms?
"I hadn’t ever thought of that...but maybe? My latest dryness symptom came on suddenly last summer. My raynauds, as well as the very bad “episode” I had when I was younger, came on in the dead of winter though and I lived in a cold climate then."
Sun is a big factor for me.  Apparently common for Sjogren.
"If I get too much sun, it will trigger a flare that will last weeks to months."
"Oh, that’s good to know. Does sunscreen help, or is it better to just stay out of the sun?"
Same story here! The lip biopsy is what gave me my final diagnosis: sjogrens. I had to beg my Dr for the test though (she wanted to wait and see)

"As far as expectations it was pretty easy. Only complication I had was my blacking out due to vasovagal syncope (just from the numbing shot! But this is a problem for me sadly, I was expecting it) the biopsy itself took a few minutes. I swelled up quite a bit because I'm a bleeder (if you aren't I wouldn't worry) but I was eating and chewing just fine the next day."

My understanding is that you can't have any false results with this test. It's pretty binary and I was a clear positive. Since then I was able to go on meds which helped me so much!

Hope this helps!
I had positive ANAs and a positive lip biopsy to get my Sjogren's diagnosis. The meds have really helped but I am still not at 100% and I still have flares.

I don't know if you'll find people in this sub who don't have any autoimmune conditions.
"I had negative blood test results more than once, but the lip biopsy was positive. A plastic surgeon did my biopsy, and it healed up without incident. I had already been diagnosed with an autoimmune illness before the Sjogren's diagnosis."
"It took me ten years to get diagnosed, but fortunately for me I was under the old criteria.  The new [US-European criteria ](https://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/disease-information/diagnosis-sjogrens-syndrome/americaneuropean-consensus-criteria-sjgrens-syndrome/) includes the biopsy.  My doc hates it because the results are not as definitive as one would think.  I had biopsy done for small fiber neuropathy,  it was negative, and they damaged a blood vessel in my leg.  I had to have endoscopic laser ablation done to seal it off. They tried to convince me later to do it again because they found a better lab.  Nope, you had your chance.  I ticked all the other boxes, especially blood tests, for Sjogren’s, including Schirmer’s test, and doc said his first charge is to do no harm and a biopsy risk vs reward wasn’t there.  It wouldn’t have changed how doc would have treated the disease.  One thing that resonated with me is his belief is that if diagnosed sooner, the better the outcome should be.  Take Venus Williams for example. She is still playing competitive tennis after her diagnosis, but she caught it relatively early.  Being rich doesn’t hurt either.   Best of luck to you in diagnostic purgatory.   Things you can do in the meantime it’s exercise and take better care of yourself.   Watch out for the snake oil salesmen promising miracle cures.   I’d also get a second opinion.  I think you’re being jerked around."
"I agree with just about all ofFM’s points above. The only extra advice I’d give is to pay extra attention to your eye and dental health regardless of the test results. If you’re ticking all the boxes for dry mouth, throat, lips, etc., it pays to invest in extra dental check-ups and dry mouth damage prevention products (prescription toothpastes and mouthwashes from your provider are especially vital). If you can find a dentist who specializes in Sjogren’s—or has experience with the condition—that would be ideal. Experienced dentists can help you with your diagnosis. At the very least, your dentist can treat you “as if” you have Sjogren’s, which basically means they prescribe products to reduce the awful dryness and focus on minimizing damage."

"You’ll want to have your doctor prescribe moisturizing drops to prevent cataracts or pain from dry eyes, as well. My eyes have definitely suffered because my diagnosis took so long, and your physician can treat the symptoms now. I guess that’s the best way to deal with health providers’ reluctance to diagnose Sjogren’s in general. Keep a list of your worst symptoms, and make sure your providers treat your troubles seriously."
"It was late last night when I replied and I didn't have time include some of the very good things /u/emmadash mentioned before my sleep meds kicked in.  I don't post here as often as I should, so I'm going to try and make up for it today.  Hopefully this long rant with be worth it."

"Yes, start living your life as you if you have Sjogren's because there are really no downsides to doing the self help parts.  Taking certain meds does  have downsides and only you can weight the risk vs reward for you."

"Dental care should be near obsessive compulsive unless you like pain and have a lot of money.  I use Prevident 5000 prescription toothpaste once a day at night and I get a flouride treatment every other dental visit.  Not covered by insurance as adults, but it's pennywise pound foolish not to IMO.  I use a Philips ultrasonic toothbrush at home and keep a Quip toothbrush at work and use Sensodyne toothpaste during regular brushings. I do mouthwash too, but do Prevident once a day last before bed so it doesn't get rinsed away.  Stop with sugary and acidic drinks.  Just stop.  Without the normal moisture in your mouth like non-Sjogren's patients have, you leave yourself open to rampant cavities.  If you do drink them on occasion, brush teeth after as soon as you can.  Don't let that sugar sit in your mouth.  Meds like Evoxac and Salagen help with dry mouth for some.  They lost their effectiveness over time for me.  Salagen is a 4x/day med and it's hard to work that into a daily routine.   Evoxac is a 3x/day med.  Sugarless gum can be your friend.  It can help with dry mouth and reduce cavity chances by helping keep your mouth clean.  Xylitol lozenges can help too.  I used to jog with a couple of those in my mouth since I'm a mouth breather.  I keep Chapstick with me at all times too."

"Plaquenil - I was on for 20 years and recent studies raise some concern about toxicity and eye problems.  My doc cut me down from 400mg to 200mg/day, but that still requires an annual field vision test and that's not cheap for me.  I made the decision to stop plaquenil.  Saves me about $300/yr not taking med and doing the test.  For the record, I had no eye or other problems with it in the 20 years I was on it.  It was my decision alone to stop and it was for financial reasons.  All these meds, eye drops, toothbrushes, etc. add up over time and the risk vs reward vs cost wasn't working for me for plaquenil.  My money was needed to deal with other aspects of life with SS."

"Prednisone - it's a damn freaking magic medicine, but over time it can lead to weight gain and a rounded face appear...like a chipmunk.  It's a steroid, so it reduces your body's ability to fight infection.  The dryness affects my nasal passages too, which leaves me more vulnerable to infection already as it is.  I only do prednisone in dose packs and even then only when absolutely necessary.  It affects bone density.  I found out after a second unexplained foot fracture (I had 4 total over 18 months) that I had undiagnosed osteoporosis, most likely from prednisone use.  Another reason to avoid if you can."

"Eyes - only use non-preservative drops.  They are more expensive, but the  preservatives can buildup in your eyes over time causing problems.  A recent bout of blepharitis treated with Tobradex resulted in my having toxic conjunctivitis because of preservative and antibiotic used in that.  It was an expensive nightmare to recover from.  It took six months!  I keep drops in the car, in laptop bag, nightstand, work, travel bag, etc.  Ointments at night are crucial for me as my eyes don't close properly all the way.  Using things like eyelid pads and hot compresses once a day may be necessary to prevent the blepharitis I mentioned - another fun side effect of dry eyes.  Avoid ceiling fans if you can.  I keep my on reverse at home when I do use them.  I have cardboard blocking the vent above me at work and have had to threaten building maintenance workers if they took it down.  I can feel even the slight wisp of air coming from that thing.  I have some prescription sunglasses with snap-in side shields to help with the wind when I go outside, especially if I go to the beach or cycling.  Avoid smoke like the plague.  Bad for eyes as well as lungs.  Avoid sprays and be careful when using.  Lack of protective layer of moisture on your eyes leaves to vulnerable to absorbing chemicals.  If I spray air freshener I point away from me then walk away immediately.  Painting sucks.  If you must, try to use one with as low a VOC as possible.  Paint store person can help with that.  You may be fine while painting, but then you'll wake up in the AM with bloodshot eyes and searing pain."

"Sinuses - like for some, dryness extends to my sinuses as well as eyes.  Using nasal rinses like OTC saline spray bottle or Neil Med rinse is important, especially during winter months.  Sometimes I'll use a humidifier too."

"Get used to having Sjogren's routines as I've outlined.  Embrace the suck, because it is necessary.  Did I brush my teeth?  Did I remember to floss?  Did I remember to put in drops and ointments?  Do I have eyedrops by nightstand so I can get my eyes open without ripping part of my cornea off (yep, that's a thing) when the alarm goes off."

"You must be an active participant in your healthcare.  The days of relying on the doc to tell you everything you need to know has long since been over.  Educate yourself and steer wide and clear of any advice that promises you some quick relief.  Stick with bonafide medical websites like Mayo Clinic, NIH, Johns Hopkins, etc and legit support groups.  I'm fortunate that I work for an academic medical center (not in a clinical role) and have better than average access to information because of that.  Too much quack science out there and it's easy to go chasing miracle cures because you're vulnerable and they know it.  We've all done it before, especially when first diagnosed.  Changes in diet help, but gluten didn't give you Sjogren's and cutting it out won't make it go away.  If it does then you didn't have Sjogren's in the first place.  Yes, you might feel better, but that's for a variety of different reasons I won't get into here.  Exercise in moderation and start slow."

Best of luck.
Acupuncture by a world renowned practitioner. And herbs. This plus prolonged fasting mimicking has been huge for me.
"Ha!  :). I am honestly sitting in front of my acupuncture office as I read this!  Yes it does help me - nothing helps me get 100% better but every little thing helps a bit (aip diet, sleep, meds,etc). I see it as a part of my over all action plan."
Tried loads of different herbs from ashwagandha to different fungi. The best results have been change from keto to zerocarb. Been able to stay healthy for 2 years now.

"My background is 39 male with mctd, sjögrens and gout. Try zerocarb."
"I would be careful with this. There is not tons of regulation on herbal supplements in the US, and contamination can be a problem. I don’t know if that would be different in another country. I read Australia has had contaminated supplements seized. Sometimes it’s just fillers and stuff, but your supplement might not be exactly what you think it is."
What do you mean by fasting mimicking?
"I can't say huge enough.  I'm off all five of my prescription meds... I have hashimoto, celiac and Sjögren's"
"I've been off of my meds since February. Thyroid panel looked great three months ago, waiting for recent labs. I feel incredible. My fog has lifted..."
"Thanks for the post. Can you elaborate on the ""fasting mimicking"", and what herbs you felt actually made a difference?"
How long do you stay on the fasting mimicking diet each time you do it?

Super fascinating stuff... Check Dr. Valter Longo on Rhonda Patrick talking about autoimmunity
https://youtu.be/evGFWRXEzz8

"It's allowing the body to go through the autophagy and stem cell based regeneration that comes with prolonged water fasting while feeding the body a very specific food combination--  caloric content, macro and micro nutrient ratio, prebiotic and probiotic content."

"My thyroid levels are completely normal after being on thyroid meds for almost 10 years. I've come off dexilent, plaquinil, zyrtec for chronic hives, cytomel, and am about to xompletelyycome off my half dose of synthroid this month after my next cycle of fasting mimicking."
"See above, check out Dr Valter Longos work on fasting."
As for herbs... My doctor has a whole host of things compounded into packets. I've mostly done just the acupuncture with herbs for specific issues.
Five days and then I've played with longer because of unrelated parasite infection 😬
I find I have more energy and less joint pain (plus lessens the sinus pressure).  I think for me it is just one tool in my Auto Immune tool box of things that make me feel better.  Not one thing for me is that magic pill. Just got out of my session and I am much more free of stress and have a bit more energy (but it could also be because I fell asleep during the session! ) 🤣
Do you remember roughly where they discuss autoimmunity in the video?
"I don't, but from understanding fasting and inflammation th he whole podcast is relevant"
"I’ve not had one but I am a Dental Hygienist. Ask your Doctor for some pain meds. Use warm salt water to rinse but very gently rinse. See if they will let you use some topical anesthetic like Oragel or Kanka. Good luck. My Rhuemy did not recommend this for me because he felt unnecessary and painful. However, working in the health field, I do know opinions differ."

If your Doctor doesn’t have any advice or solutions you can always call your dentist and make an appointment. I’m not sure if ENTs are really as sensitive to mouth pain.
Yes they definitely will. If my Rheumatologist changes his mind and refers me that’s who I would request. They will make you more comfortable. I wouldn’t even do it w/out IV conscious sedation! Lol. I’m glad that your doc sent you there. Good call!
No problem. Happy to help.
"The only not so nice thing is the cosmetic side, aka your lip will be probably really swollen. My lips turned half white for a while and all. But it calmed down in a couple of days. I took some painkillers and managed fine. :) The only thing I was surprised by was just how swollen my lip got."

Ps. Here’s two pics of how my lips looked:

https://imgur.com/a/iiSQWBD

The first one is about ten hours after the procedure and the bottom is couple of hours. Sorry for the horrible pics though.😂
Mine wasn’t that bad. It was a little swollen and hurt a little for a day and healed pretty quickly. Good luck.
"In my experience, the pain/swelling from the surgery itself was fine after a day. But then the swelling and pain came back a couple of days later and it turned out it was because my lip did not like the stitches (I forgot what kind they were), and I was reacting to that."
Mine was fine. My lip was a little swollen but barely noticeable. It was difficult to eat anything other than very mushy lukewarm not-spicy foods for several days with the stitches. I didn't have a lot of pain and it didn't cause me to feel really ill or anything.
"As I recall it wasn't all that bad a recovery. A day or two of soreness? Not too pleasant during, but I've had dental procedures that were far worse."

No numbness to speak of after the fact. Guess I was lucky.
I had mine then travelled the next day. It wasn't too bad but I got something like a mouth sore which hurt for 5 days or so whenever I ate.
Thank you! I should have mentioned that my rheumatologist referred me to oral surgery for the procedure. So hopefully they will have more knowledge about mouth pain and recovery than an ENT would.
Yay that makes me feel a lot better about it. Thanks!
Haha oh wow that does not look fun. I’ll take some swelling over pain any day though. Thanks for sharing! Now maybe I won’t be in complete shock when I see myself in the mirror after the procedure and it looks like I just lost a boxing match 😂
Ooh that makes me feel better! Thank you!
Oh no that sounds like something that would happen to me. I’m normally really sensitive to things going in/on my body. Thanks for sharing so if I do have a reaction maybe I’ll have an idea of what’s going on
Thanks :)
Thanks!
Totally! I went to work like after about seven hours and I just told everyone I had a weird ”dental procedure” because I didn’t feel like explaining the whole sjögrens stuff. I also put some red lipstick to cover the white spot. It worked since only a few people noticed. xD

"One thing more by the way, my lip was partly numb for almost six months after (like a small spot in that swollen area), but it slowly got better so no need to worry about that either. I kinda freaked out but then it luckily eventually healed well."

"Anyways, best of luck for your operation!😇"
"Sincerely, my experience really wasn’t bad. I’ll be praying you have an easy time with it! 🦋🦋🦋"
"Yeah the numbness is one of the things I’m most worried about but I keep trying to remind myself that it probably won’t last forever and even if it does, I’ll get used to it and won’t notice it eventually. Thank you so much for making me feel better about it. You really helped a lot ☺️"
Thanks again :)
"No problem, and I’m here if you have any other questions about the experience. :)"
"I sometimes have this happen (and often it's painful for me). Here's what I try when that happens: suck on sour, hard candies (like the lemon ones), massage the glands, warm compresses. I hope this helps :)"
"I had swollen glands for months with no pain, too. Plaquenil did nothing for me (It might be good for your fatigue though, so wait and see). I started taking Peony supplements since I heard they were good and now my glands are back to normal. I have no idea if me taking them reduced it or it just went away on its own."
"This is very painful. I’ve had it happen a few times. The first time the doc put me on anti inflamatories, the next time a different doc put me on antibiotic. Both worked, but I don’t respond well to anti inflamatories. The sour sweets are good, sucking a lemon is good but not easy! Warm compresses also and pain killers"
I wonder what this means for people like me who got it pretty young (diagnosed at 27).
"Clarification: My doctor conducted the study, but didn't write the article."
"Ok this is very interesting. I think I may Sjogren’s and am currently waiting to get into a Rheumatologist. My appointment is in August. I have all symptoms: dry eyes so severe I have to use Thera Tears twice daily, hair falling out, severe joint pain and swelling, dry vaginal area, and more. Many of these symptoms also could be thyroid related and it’s possible because I have a large thyroid nodule. I went to the Endocrinologist and my thyroid bloodwork is great (I’m not on thyroid medication btw) and my nodule is stable and has not grown. Ok so it’s not my thyroid."

"I also have had 15 day menstrual cycles so my next appointment was with the ob/gyn. She said due to the timing of my prolonged periods, I have low progesterone. I realized I probably have had low progesterone for years but was masked because I was on the pill. It seems my symptoms slowly started 5 years ago when I got off the pill. I started taking progesterone four days ago and my swelling has decreased tremendously. I still have a little pain but I’m hoping it goes away eventually. My eyes don’t feel as dry so I’m only using the drops once a day."

"The thing is when you’re low progesterone, it makes you estrogen dominant and that seems to cause problems, which is what they also learned from this article. I’m still going to the Rheumatologist to get answers."
"I had ridiculously low testosterone levels...wonder if this may be a connection? Also diagnosed young, at 23."
"I’ve thought this for a long time. My symptoms for Sjögren’s occurred within six months of weaning off of HRT (Estrogen only). I went from active and healthy to barely being able to walk. I’m doing better now, but to this day my rheumy is dubious about the connection."
"This is so interesting. My cycles are all kinds of messed up. My progesterone is low and of course the balance is totally out of whack too, with estrogens also being on the low side. I don't have a sjogrens diagnosis and am due to go to the rheum in October. The analytical side of me is interested in how this plays out."
"I was just diagnosed at 28, so I’m curious about this as well. I have always had a healthy menstrual cycle with no issues. I guess there are multiple factors that can cause Sjogrens, but maybe this is the reason it is more common in older women."
I was just diagnosed at 19 and they switched me to a no estrogen birth control and my symptoms got so much worse.
">I’m still experiencing severe hand weakness -can’t hold things well, have a hard time driving as clutching the steering wheel causes pain in my finger knuckles, bending my hands feels like I have rubber bands I’m fighting & hand aches."

"I used to have *severe* weakness in my hands and arms while chronically sick - was absolutely convinced it was a symptom of the disease that wouldn't go away, until I started getting panic attacks and ended up in the ER - turned out my back muscles were tight af from the stress of it all and that was the reason for my hand weakness. I got muscle relaxants (that I didn't take because their side effects were terryfying) and started going to a massage therapist - it took a while for my muscles to ""reset"", the first few months they'd just go right back to their usual setting and the only time I had some relief was while getting the massage, but now the problem is pretty much gone as long as I do a few minutes of yoga before sleep."

"I also took (and still take) 600-800 mg of magnesium daily as recommended by a neurologist, she said your muscles go tense when you're stressed and that causes anxiety by itself, it'a a vicious cycle. Chronic stress (and alcohol and caffeine consumption, btw) deplete your magnesium stores, and magnesium deificiency causes anxiety, insomnia, depression, panic attacks... and tense muscles. I honestly didn't even know how bad my back was until the therapist started to work on my back and I almost puked from the pain the first few massages. She said my back was like a rock."

"tl;dr: read up on magnesium deficiency, visit a massage therapist, get a magnesium supplement. Magnesium oxide is the cheapest but useless, magesium citrate and lactate for example are well absorbed."

"I haven't taken steroids, but I take gabapentin and plaquenil. I have a pain, stiffness and weakness in my hands. Rheumatologist doesn't seem to care. I have no advice but wanted to share!"
I get the numbness and pain in my hands. I once dropped dinner cause I couldn't hold it so my hand just released it. This was before the found I have RA and secondary Sjogren's. Talk to your rhuemy and see if you could see a neurologist to see if its a pinched nerve or something else. Also be careful with the Aleve. I was on daily prescription dose of naproxen and it gave me ulcers. I now have severe anemia and have to watch my iron levels. I've already had 1 transfusion and was really close to having another.
Did your doctor xray your hands?
"You're not crazy. No matter what, just keep remembering that."
"When I take prednisone I get unusually happy. I'm sorry you don't seem to be ""suffering"" from that side effect :)"
"My doctors think anxiety is the cause of most of my problems too so in on Cymbalta now to prove them wrong. My physical symptoms haven't improved but my depression has. I think I would be having a much more difficult time dealing with all the stress of my illness if I wasn't on an anti-anxiety antidepressant.  So if you're not currently on one, I obviously can't recommend getting on one. But do consider asking your doctor about it. Like I said, I'm still really sick. But at least I'm not overly depressed and I've proven to my doctors that my other symptoms aren't caused by anxiety."
To add on to what others have said you have to acknowledge there will be a lifestyle change with this diagnosis. I can't really carve wood as much as id like (it hurts my hands) and I had to change my diet. I get tired more. Il capitalize on my energy when I have it but I have to listen to my body
"I went to my doctor because of joint (hand pain) and carpal tunnel like symptoms. Then my toes, foot and ankle started hurting. Didn't even put a ton of other symptoms together until after I started researching. Had the swollen jaw glands (blamed first on wisdom teeth then just oncoming illness), stomach cramping and digestive issues (had my gallbladder removed in 2014, obviously my body is still adjusting), dry eyes and mouth (I wear contacts and live in az no surprise)."

"Though everything I've read, everybodys case is different and sjogrens is so hard to diagnosis because it mimics ra. I started on 200mg/day plaquenil then increased to 400mg/day. And it's almost night and day, the carpel tunnel symptoms are non existent. I get some flares, a random joint will hurt, my knees seem to be carrying extra fluid. But last appointment i told my rheumatologist I felt 99% like my old self."

"Ultimately if you aren't getting relief from your symptoms, your doctor should be trying different options. My next appointment in a few months well decided to either stick to plaquenil or switch to methotrexate."

"Hopefully another opinion, especially a specialist in sjogrens can help you get back to your old self!"
"Sjogrens or not, sounds like a good plan! Hope it's helping you. Thanks."
"Very interesting info, thank you for your input!"
"Thanks! Just knowing others seem to have similar symptoms makes it not so lonely. Most SS ppl in person I’ve spoken with say they have no pain, just fatigue and dryness etc. I’ve started feeling like the pain was truly in my head."
"I’ll keep that on the back burner in case, thanks!"
"Yes, no joint damage- there was some white/bone calcification from living my life (probably poor choices as well hahaha) but overall my hands looked fine from both what the xray tech said and the doc didn’t even say anything just no damage."
Really glad that’s helping! I didn’t get any really bad effects from pred except being thirsty all the damn time and severely sun sensitive. Id go out for five minutes and come in with what felt like a burn.
What diet changes were helpful for you?
Thank you so much for this!
No problem :) Hope it helps.

Some more things I remembered now:
"magnesium deficiency won't show up in blood tests as the blood levels are controlled independently, and things have to be really bad everywhere else for the blood levels to go down. 95% of the magnesium stores is in muscles, brain and other tissues, only a tiny percentage of it is in the blood. My neuro said blood tests are not reliable to diagnose magnesium deficiency."

"If you take a supplement, split it into a few doses - 600 mg at once might have a laxative effect, I usually take 400 at once tops. Don't wash it down with coffee or booze as they mess with magnesium absorption."

"Oh and check your vitamin D levels too, its deficiency is a freaking plague and it has a huge effect on muscles too,plus is important when dealing with autoimmune diseases. If you supplement vitamin D, you need to up your magnesium dosage as it's necessary to process vitamin D. Supplementing vitamin D without magnesium might actually cause magnesium deficiency symptoms in some people that they misinterpret as vitamin D overdose, because your body suddenly uses up all the magnesium you have to process the vitamin D."

Oh yes! That is hard... I am super sensitive to the sun without it so I'm glad that wasn't one of my side effects!

"Everyone is different. I cut down/out refined and process sugars and foods with hfcs and chemical sounding ingredients. I cut back on bread, I cut back on meat, I cut back on sugar in general. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating fast food as much. I've upped my vegetable intake (still working on fruits) and grains. I pay attention to fiber, iron, and vitamins like b12 and c/d. I recognized tomatoes and heavy dairy fuck me up so I avoid those. High acid foods are a no go. I try to drink a ton of water"
Being on the prednisone I’ve definitely noticed an uptick in my anxiety attacks. The withdrawals are no joke holy crap...

"I’ve finally gotten an appointment w/ a rheumatologist at a medical college that specializes in Sjogrens, I’m hopeful but still have to make it a couple more weeks with my current doc."
You too!
Best of luck with your new provider. I hope that it's the change that you need.
Thanks!
"It could be. I had no idea I even had a Sjogren's until I went to see my rheumatologist for my Hashimoto's and she went ""and what are you doing about your Sjogren's?"""

"""Sorry my what?"""

I guess she could tell just by looking at me. We did blood tests and a lip biopsy and it came back that I have it.

"Now that I'm on meds it's really obvious how dry my mouth and eyes and skin are, but I had no idea back then."
"My doc estimated that I had SS as a teen (wasn’t diagnosed till 30). Sadly, I always had dry mouth, but just never knew that “my normal” was not normal."

I’m glad your doctor is actively trying to get a diagnosis. Men are often overlooked when it comes to SS.

There are prescriptions that increase saliva flow - I take Salagen (generic is pilocarpine).  I couldn’t believe the difference.

Please let us know how it goes!
"My bloodwork showed I had it though the dryness was not that bad compared to other symptoms at the time. I belong to a Facebook support group, and many of them needed the lip biopsy to be diagnosed.  Ask for that."
"You certainly could have Sjogren's Syndrome. From my anecdotal experience, men, especially young men, are more likely to have negative blood markers. I was in a similar situation in my early 30s with a low white blood cell count being my only unusual blood test. Fatigue is certainly common in SS patients, as are stress-related flares. Are your eyes or sinuses dry as well?"
Male here.  Diagnosed around 40.

"You very well could.  I had an ANA test done which indicated autoimmune, but it wasn't until I had taken the test a few times that it actually showed up as positive for SS-A."

Look into LDN for fatigue. (Low dose naltrexone).  Life changer for me.
"Thanks so much!  I’ve read a few articles, but never came across anyone on it. I’m definitely talking to my doctor about it next week!"
Thanks for that! Did your dry mouth (or anything!) improve with treatment?
Thank you!
> pilocarpine

"Did you have a dry throat too? I'm wondering if meds that increase saliva flow help with dry throat too, as that's my main (huge) problem. I'm in the process of getting diagnosed still."
That’s really helpful — thank you. I wear contacts and i dont think my eyes are dry at all. Really its just a dry mouth which really affects the quality of my life.
Will do! Thanks v much!
How long did it take for LDN help?  I was reading SS-A positive people have more intense/ frequent fatigue. I’d love to get any energy back!  Thanks for giving me some hope!
"Not op, but mine did a bit.  Unfortunately I'm also allergic to dust mites, which was causing daily inflammation and for which my allergist put me on two daily antihistimines, which has me back to dry again.  Biotene wash and gel as well as xylitol based hard candies help.  My glands get swollen a lot, and when they do its like trying to swallow phlem in the back of your throat that won't go away, which is annoying."
Dry mouth is definitely better since starting hydroxychloroquine.

Skin and eyes are still really bad. I use Thera Tears and CeraVe like my life depends on them. 😅 Both are excellent products and I definitely recommend them.

Looking at getting punctal plugs but they terrify me.
💛
LP;DR

Salagen helps me (worth it). Generic version pilocarpine works as well and is less expensive. Dosing is usually 5mg - 2-4x day. I’m on 3x a day. There is also another med called Evocax (also increases saliva).

"For dry mouth/throat, you can also try:"
Hot teas/broths
Sugar free xylitol gum*
Sugar Free cough drops*
Caffeine/Sugar Free drinks*
"Sugar Free ice pops, iced, ice cream*"
Room humidifier
Personal face steamer
Nebulizer

Omega supplements (?-have to check with my doc next visit)

* Sugar Free - the lack of saliva + sugar = lots of cavities

*Caffeine Free - caffeine is dehydrating

There are other products out there; would be glad to help you find others

"I’m sorry you’re having a hard time!  I hope you get some relief with the care plan you doctor provides. Please let me know how you are doing, and if you need any other ideas/suggestions. I wish I knew about reddit when I was diagnosed - there’s a lot of great info!"

Take care! 💛

Long Ass Post Details:
"Oh yeah, dry throat, sinuses, ears, and of course eyes and mouth!!!  The Salagen does seem to help improve the throat and sinuses to a degree. Chewing sugar free xylitol gum helps the saliva flow, which also helps my throat - especially when speaking!  Some people use sugar free candy or cough drops too."

"I regularly use saline spray and nasal irrigation for the sinuses, but haven’t found a whole lot for the throat specifically."

"Hot tea is one thing I use; I heard there’s a tea called Throat Coat that many singers use. It’s sold in health food stores and some places like Whole Foods. I think that’s going to be my next experiment!  Humidifiers help, and I have a small personal steamer (like holding your head over a pot of hot water with a towel over your head, but much more convenient!).  I’m also going to get a nebulizer, which is a machine that people with asthma use. They mix a medication with saline, and then breathe in the steam, so the meds go into the lungs. I will just inhale saline steam (no meds)."

"And of course, drink plenty of fluids throughout the day (which I’m not always great at remembering till I’m coughing in the middle of a sentence).  Water , decaf iced tea and sugar free drinks are my beverages of choice.  I also have an addiction to Coke Zero, but the caffeine is counterproductive.  So I’ve cut back to a few a week."
——
"EDIT:  I just realized you said no meds, but will leave up in case it helps other)"
——
"There are a lot of medications that can cause dry mouth, etc.   if you take any meds, you can ask your pharmacist which could be contributing to your dry symptoms, and if there’s an option that might be better. Side note:  people never think about your pharmacist playing a part in your healthcare team, but I’ve found they are so knowledgeable. My Pharm suggested I ask my doc about omega vitamins for Sjogren’s, so that’s on my list for the next visit."
"What contacts do you use?  I think my contacts may actually help keep moisture/drops in.  My ophthalmologist just prescribed Acuvue Oasys for daily use. I was using Biofinity, but the protein buildup on the lens had me tossing them after a few uses (they were suppose to be monthly)."
"So I started off at 4.5mg and noticed the effect the next day.  After a few months, I did have some minor headaches so cut back to 3mg where I've been for a few years."

My wife can tell by looking at me if I forgot to take it the night before.

"It's cheap (<$1 a pill), extremely safe and the biggest side effect is ""vivid dreams"" and those go away pretty quickly."

"While I recommend the pills, you can also dissolve a 50mg pill in 50 ml of water and figure out your dosage. (e.g. 3 mil = 3 mg)"

"The advantage of getting 50mg pills is you can get 30 of them (a month's supply) for pretty cheap.  50mg is the standard dose for opiate addicts, etc. so that is the standard dose for them, but one 50mg pill is good for at least 15 doses for people with Auto-Immune.  If you think about it, 30 pills is good enough for 450 days of treatment, so WAAAY cheaper than $1 a pill.  I guess I'm just saying, price won't be a factor with this drug."


"That said, I like the convenience of the pills."


There are some good facebook groups with thousands of members.  Just search for LDN.
"Punctal plugs was weird bit not terrifying to me.  Numbed me up first, but it was odd lying there while they were put.  Long story, but thanks to toxic conjunctivitis I was tearing very excessively (constantly) for 3 months and had to have them removed after having been in for over 15 years to see if it would help drain the tears.  Nope.  Turns out they sealed themselves up from lack of use.   Always use preservative free eye drops.  I reacted horribly from preservative in Tobradex."
Thank you!
"That tea sounds interesting, I'll look into it. I drink a ton but that doesn't help at all... I've been chewing tons of gums but didn't think of xylitol ones."

"Omega 3s are important in autoimmune disease, as is reducing the amount of omega 6s (vegetable oils, basically) as they have the opposite effect to omega 3s - they promote inflammation. I've dropped vegetable oils pretty much, and have started to take 1000 mg of omega 3 daily (maybe it's 1500 actually), as I ate zero omega 3s for years and tons of omega 6s."

"I might also start taking white peony as I've read it helps people with autoimmune disease, and read a post from someone with Sjogren's who had big improvement on it"

"It's an immunomudolator, there are other herbs that work this way apparently, I haven't researched it yet."

"As for dry mucous membranes in general, sea buckthorn is apparently helpful - I just found a study yesterday where they tested its efectiveness in women with vaginal drynes who had sjogren's and it worked. The full stody is behind a paywall but they mention its results in another one that tried to see if it'd work for another group fo women"

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512214002394#bib0055

">Sea buckthorn (Hippophaë rhamnoides) oil has in the Central Asia traditionally been used for the treatment of inflammations in the genital organs and uterus [6]. Intake of sea buckthorn (SB) oil produced with a supercritical carbon dioxide extraction process has in clinical studies shown beneficial effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins [7], dry eye [8], markers of endothelial inflammation [9], and platelet aggregation [10]. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study in women suffering from Sjögren's syndrome, SB oil relieved the dryness-associated symptoms of genital mucous membranes [11]."

"from what I've read, you should take oil from the fruit as opposed to seeds for dry mucosa, although it seems like in this study (and therefore I'm assuming the Sjogren's one too) they used a combination of the two. I've scrolled through reviews of various sea buckthorn products on amazon and it seems like people use it for Sjogren's with success."
Thanks so much for the info!  I’ll check out the links. Cutting pro-inflammatories is a great first approach.   Take care! 💛
likewise :)
I never thought an illness could come like that but it happened to me. I had had some sort of pains and tiredness since being a teenager but it wasn’t anything I couldn’t manage.

Then in january of 2011 I just woke up one day with eyes so dry I couldn’t comprehend it. Dry mouth was followed about a week after that. When months went by I got overwhelmingly tired and started getting more and more pains.

I didn’t get diagnosed until the year 2016 because doctors can be jerks and they don’t believe you.

"But I gotta add I think it’s probably very rare to get it like this so your eye thing might be something else also, if that lasts for months then yeah it can be an autoimmune stuff. But couple of days? Don’t jump into conclusions so early."
It can indeed. Apparently parotid swelling from sjigrens is rare? but does happen. I have a friend who has exactly this. Diagnosed Sjogrens with sudden random parotid swelling (usually on one side). Docs and specialists dont have any answers but put it down to the Sjogrens. She has found what works for her are steroid tablets during flare ups limited dose and duration.  She is yet to be put on other meds. She is reluctant and looking into alternative therapies.
"Mine came on suddenly with the gland issue, too. I had tingling in my extremities, too. They didn't connect the dots since the tingling wasn't MS according to nerve conduction, spinal tap, and MRI results. Even after repeated incidents of gland troubles (like 4 times in as many months), it still took years for someone to diagnose Sjogren's. After each time a gland swelled up and hurt so terribly, I'd be told things like ""suck on small bits of lemon"" or ""drink/eat pickles"" and given antibiotics. Still though, do go to a doctor so you can discuss all possibilities. I wish I had known what Sjogren's was then because I could have advocated better for myself. I hope you feel empowered to ask the questions when you see a doctor."
"Yeah, it was mostly the parotid swelling and ridiculously dry eyes showing up at the same time, with no explanation, that had me concerned. Hopefully I'm worrying unnecessarily."

Sorry for your struggles. :(
"I'm pretty good at being pushy with docs after years of advocating for myself re chronic migraines, so I'm not afraid to ask the questions. I'm so sad to see how many people have suffered for years or decades with this, and hope to find answers sooner. Thank you for your input, and sorry for your suffering!"
"Yeah, let’s hope it’s not sjögren’s but just some passing thing in your case. :)"
Dry mouth and thirst are different. Were you tested for diabetes mellitus?I have both diabetes and Sjögren's Syndrome. There's a stark difference between thirst and dry mouth.
I don't know.

"Anecdotally, I was diagnosed with a lip biopsy and I do have quite the appetite for beverages. It doesn't feel like typical thirst most of the time, but I am medicated now. It feels more like my mouth is dry and it's nice to keep my mouth hydrated. I never really let it get to the point where my mouth or throat hurts like it does with extreme thirst. I also find that keeping hydrated generally just helps me feel less tired, helps my skin look better, my eyes are less dry, and I don't have as much of the GI issues."

"I easily drink 1.5-2 gallons of beverages (mostly water, but also coffee, and things like coconut water, or a light juice like Bai) a day without even forcing myself to. And I'm not obsessed with water, that's just how much I needed to feel ""right"". I really like coconut water and aloe vera juice, they seem to give me more benefit than just water."
Yes! I feel like I've been stranded on a deserted island 24/7. I use lozenges for dry mouth and oral sprays but they dont do much.
For me my dry mouth causes me to feel thirsty all the time.
I'll go through periods where I feel like I can't get enough liquid in. I'll chug a bottle of water then another. My stomach will scream NO MORE but my mouth will be saying I'm thirsty. It's more than just a dry mouth thing. It's an actual thirst feeling.

"I do have horrible dry eyes and dry mouth too. They put in plugs in my eyes and I'm on restasis, and that combo seemed to help a tiny bit. But nothing really helps my mouth. It's hard to suck on a lozenge when you have no saliva to 'melt' it. The gels and rinses only seem help while in my mouth and for about 30 seconds after."
Dry mouth & dry eyes were my initial symptoms.
"Absolutely. I found relief from biotene mouthwash and increasing good fats like avocado, coconut oil, fish oil and sea buckthorn."
Interesting.

"I tested positive for SS-A and -B Ab, but that revelation came about by chance.  We were looking for the possibility of rheumatoid arthritis, which ended up being negative."

"So the bloodwork points to Sjogrens, but aside from that, I have none of the classic Sjogrens symptoms.  (Long time Raynaud's sufferer however.)"

Until...it dawned on me one day that perhaps my constant thirst is a precursor to Sjogrens.  Have no idea if it truly is.  I drink much more water than anyone I know.  Not just out of habit -- I feel parched if I don't. I easily down 2 litres of fluids by mid-morning.  Probably 6 - 8 litres over the whole day.  I used to think it was because I talked  a lot at work and exercise/sweat a lot.  Mentioned this to my specialist; she didn't make a big deal about it.
"My dry mouth forces me to drink a lot of water which means I rarely get thirsty. So I would say no, Sjogren's doesn't cause thirst for me."
"If you are younger, note that a lot of the time Sjogren's sicca symptoms show up after others like neurological issues. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4493630/) describes it. I think its still worth getting ANA full panel but  it could definitely be something else worth exploring."
"If I am reading correctly, diabetes mellitus is what we hear as type 1 or type 2 diabetes."
"I’ve had full bloodwork, where I asked the doctor to include diabetes tests, once a year for the last 3 years - I am a few points below the prediabetic range, but the doc said no need for medications."
Thanks for the response.
">sts, once a year for the last 3 years - I am a few points below the prediabetic range, but the doc said no need for medications. Thanks for the response."

what is the. prediabteic range?
[deleted]
"I did it and it helped a little bit but not enough for me to continue it because it was way too hard. Like I didn’t have the energy nor money to sustain it, so I stopped."
"i’ve been AIP for a year- have so far successfully reintroduced several foods without issue, but it’s taught me what makes me itchy, what makes my stomach unhappy, what makes my joints hurt, what makes me tired, what gives me brainfog. i had no insurance for three years, and this was the only thing that helped mitigate symptoms that i didn’t have many resources to check into. finally have insurance, a positive ANA, and a referral to the rheumatologist. after a flare up of peripheral neuropathy, angular chelitis, and two years of severe neck and hip joint pain, in eyeing sjögrens. i’ve been thirsty for ten years. i say GO FOR IT. it changed my life."
"So far, I think it really helps the dysautonomic symptoms and helps me mitigate flares. It's funny to try to figure out what I ate/drank that might be giving me troubles. But certain symptoms really diminished, like reflux and some fatigue. I wouldn't say it touches the dryness yet, but I'm hopeful."
My doc just suggested that I give the Keto diet a try. It sounds similar to the paleo diet. Anyone here have experience with the keto diet to minimize symptoms?
"I have a Lupus cookbook that my husband bought for me. I love it and most of the recipes are really good : ) it’s helped a lot with my symptoms. I’ve been eating it since my last flare and missed the seasonal change flare! Yay! It’s been about 3 months and I’m down 14 pounds (I was never overweight) and I feel good, keeping my fingers crossed"
Why keto? Weight loss?
"Well Weight Loss not my reason for choosing) to start it but he said it would help give my adrenal glands a break with the whole insulin needing to be released in response to every meal, etc. since adrenal insufficiency is a big hyuugqproblem for me (and anyone else I imagine, lol 😂"

And a second reason:
"My hives are back again and my doc thinks it’s something I’m eating and I agree with him mostly. I have issues when I eat sugar I know that sugar pisses off my rashes as well, so keto (and paleo diet) might help me out."
"Yes. First I tried Salagen, but it made me quite queasy and pee a lot. Switched to Evoxac and it works wonders for me. Can’t live without it"
Do they reduce the swellings?
Salagan made me sick also.  I have been doing Evoxac and have had few side effects.  Sometimes get a little dizzy and blurred vision but works well.  I have high deductible plan so do not file insurance and use GoodRX card for $84.
"I don’t live in the states, so I’m not familiar with that type of insurance"
"I just started Salagen a few weeks ago and so far, I dig it. I wish the effects lasted longer, but I think I'll ask my doctor to increase the dose. I can feel the effects wear off after just a couple of hours. But I haven't gotten sick from it at all. Occasionally, I get blurred vision though."
Are they expensive? I have good insurance
I have good insurance and they are about $30 for 90 day supply (you take 3pills a day) from CVS.
That’s a relief. Thank you!
"Yes, and it happens in several places on me and I've had no explanation for it.  In the shower if I twist to wash my backside, then one side will cramp up.  If I need to brush snow off a car, my thumb and index finger will cramp instantly.  The shoulder/upper arm thing too, it just happens for no reason.  It's bizarre."
"Wow - this was so interesting for me to read, because my right shoulder is the location of greatest chronic pain for me. It was so bad for awhile that I went to my rheum and asked for x-rays. Thought something was majorly wrong in there. She felt around and said just lots of inflammation. She also recommended pilates, too, and I started it that week. Less than a year later and I'm not icing, heating, and rubbing magnesium lotion on my shoulder every single day anymore. I'm down to maybe a few times a month of nagging shoulder pain. Good luck!"
Not sure if it's me pulling a muscle or me overusing my muscle because of joint pain but usually on the weekends my right bicep will be weak and sore (like I did an extreme arm workout). makes it nearly impossible to lift my arm above my head.

Im assuming from me picking up and wearing my purse.
Yes. I had my calf pop out of place the other day. I also have a gland near my windpipe that sometimes will pop out of place if I move a certain way and it's painful! It eventually pops back in. Not even sure it's a lymph node. Has anyone had this happen?
"Also: my shoulders are what originally hurt me the worst. The muscles would get inflamed, and hot. They were also so so so sore and I lived like that for almost 5-6 years thinking it was just fibromyalgia. Sometimes it was so bad that I would just sleep all day because my body hurt SO bad! I was getting short of breath during these flare ups too. Who knew a little prednisone and Plaquenil would make it better? I haven't had that kind of muscle pain in so long. Im thankful!"
I didn't even know that's what my pain was until just now. Thank you!
"I haven't been officially diagnosed yet... as many know, it's been an interesting and sometimes painful road."
"I just tested positive for SSA and while Sjogrens wasn’t on my radar, now a lot makes sense. I went to GP for a host of weird symptoms and since I have a cousin with MS, she called in a complete ANA panel."
"It took 17 years for my diagnosis. I didn't even know what Sjögren's Syndrome was at the time. More than anything, I felt cruddy, as if I had the flu."
Five years for me
"I am the same age, had the exact same symptoms as you with the same “idiopathic” reasoning since April of 2017. I finally met a rheum in November, had negative bloodwork in December but then went for a lip biopsy, got diagnosed in January."
"about 3 years. 34 yo male ( i'm the 1 in 10!). the dehydrated feeling sucks for sure. I have lots of joint pain, fatigue, arthritis, depression. all that fun stuff It's still nice to finally put a name to the madness. Hopefully we all find treatment that works"
12 yrs ish
"1 year, but it took nearly 100 dr visits and almost every test / scan out there. what a nightmare that year was."
"It took me over 17 years to finally be properly diagnosed with Sjögren’s. All (or most) of the normal bloodwork done to test for autoimmune disorders were within normal range- INCLUDING MY ANA, SSA, etc. According to my Rheumatologist at Mayo, bloodwork can only rest for about 2 of about 7 known markers for Sjögren’s. So as of right now, Sjögren’s is probably being way under-diagnosis’s. Because of having ALL the classic symptoms, along with a diagnosis of Hyperadrenergic POTS and Orthostatic Intolerance, Hypothyroidism, and a suspicion of being “Immunologically A-Typical” my Rheumatologist did a lip biopsy and found what he described as “Profound evidence of Sjögren’s.” He immediately started me on Plaquenil and IVIG treatment as I was also experiencing severe neuropathy in my hands and arms. Within 3 months, I started to feel like a totally different human being. BE YOUR BEST ADVOCATE AND DON’T GIVE UP! It took countless PCPs and Specialists to find a doctor who took the time to sit and listen to every symptom, every previous diagnosis or misdiagnosis, what doctors had tried, tested, etc. But once I found that one doctor who was willing to listen- it changed my life. Be sure to take notes with you to every appointment. Some doctors will think it’s all in your head or do the typical “idiopathic” diagnosis because they can’t handle not knowing what’s really going on. (This coming from a doctors daughter). Just keep pushing. Also, sometimes the biggest and best doctors in your area are the worst to go to because they are SO busy they don’t have the time to listen. It’s a challenge to find the right doctor- and even then, it’s a challenging diagnosis, but it’s something I think everyone on this site can relate to. This site has saved me from going to some pretty dark places while I’m the midst of not having a diagnosis. Wondering if I WAS crazy....? Maybe it wasn’t real fatigue, maybe I’m just lazy...? Am I just being overly dramatic? Maybe everyone with allergies feels this way (dry eyes, throat, etc). It’s so incredible to have a place to go with questions or just to read to know that you’re far from alone and that there is actually hope and light at the end of the tunnel!"
"It took at least 3 years to find a doctor who believed me when I said something was wrong. My joint pain was so bad I could barely do anything but most doctors dismissed me because I was “too young” to have joint pain. Or, because I have depression and anxiety, they would attribute it to that."
"I’m glad that you have an answer to your symptoms. Did you happen to test positive for ANA? I recently had my blood tested for ANA and it was negative. I’m going to push for further testing specifically the SSA, SSB and possibly a lip biopsy to make sure."
I’m sorry to hear that and I hope you are managing well now. I also feel like I have the flu most of the time.
"That seems to be the average, 5-7 years. I hope now that you have been diagnosed you are able to manage your symptoms better!"
"I tested negative for ANA recently, but I have heard about the lip biopsy. Im going to ask for it as well as more antibody testing."
I’m happy to hear you were given a diagnosis from that and finally have an answer.
"Thanks for sharing, I’m always interested to hear from younger people with chronic illness."
I also hope everyone finds a treatment or in the least a good way to manage.
"Thank you so much for this post! I’m going to my rhuematologist tomorrow again and this gave me more confidence to really push for testing. He dismissed me months ago because I only had the GI symptoms, but now I have dryness, dysautonomia and numb/tingling limbs."

I’m sorry you went through 17 years of that and were dismissed for so long. I often think “is it all in my head?” and “am I just being lazy?”.  Those are not good thoughts nor are they constructive. I’m glad you are getting the treatment you need now.
"Also, my symptoms that were the issue for me was not dry eyes and mouth, although I have them. I went to my doctor for tingling in my hands, cold feet, sudden reflux and likely gastroparesis to a degree. But I did have bad hives and eye swelling last fall. I had a baby last year so I chalked a lot up to that until the tingling and bad reflux started. Seemed like a cascade of symptoms - because it was! I don't know if mine is a combo of SS and lupus, or something else. I also have hypermobility so likely will ask about other connective tissue issues."
"Actually, no. My ANA was negative; my GP had just requested a full panel. Apparently my results are NOT normal by many clinical standards but the more research I do the more it seems to pop up. Both my SSA and DS-DNA was positive. It's worth pushing for more! Obviously I've got something going on and if I'd only used my ANA results I would not be heading to the rheumatologist! I'm not sure what all I've got going on, lol, except the positive SSA is diagnostic of Sjogren's and in retrospect I see a lot of symptoms."
"I needed the diagnosis mostly so that I can get benefits from the government, I knew I wouldn’t get any proper help since there is no cure and doctors here where I live don’t know too much about autoimmune disorders in general."

"Anyways, in your post you say you drink seven liters of water in a day. It sounds like you’re drinking way too much. Have you ever discussed about drinking so much with your doctor? Feeling thirsty in your case is not because you would be dehydrated, it’s because your mouth is dry. There are gels in pharmacies that will help with that. :)"
"I am hoping to get the diagnosis for benefits as well. I am somewhat able to work a full-time job right now, but things just seem to be getting worse and I don’t know if I can keep up this pace."

"I have spoken to my doctor about water consumption and I was told to make sure I’m drinking plenty of fluids to help with my dysautonomia. It’s raises my blood volume and blood pressure, which relieves my OH symptoms. I didn’t realize that my “thirst” could be just dry mouth. I will look into those gels, thank you!"
I have sjögrens and endometriosis. Endometriosis can cause infertility. I would consider looking into it even if you think you have normal periods because I thought I did but only considered it after experiencing period type pain when not on my period.
I have lupus and Sjogrens.  I've had a few miscarriages (Not not quite infertility but...).

"Anyway, i get all the blood tests confused but I think I had a blood marker for antiphospholipid syndrome. Or maybe just a Anti ssa or ssb.  It was never really explained to me but I had a couple later than normal miscarriages, and I had to have my last child's heart monitored in vitro because of it."

"May want to ask your Dr about it, to see if you have it and if it could be an issue for you."
"I’ve been concerned about endometriosis, but my OBGYN dismissed my concerns because I don’t have the typical symptoms and “you’re still young.” I’m in the process of finding a new provider now."
"I believe it’s very common for someone with lupus to have the antibodies for antiphospholipid syndrome. None of my recent labs have hinted towards lupus. I’ve had so much blood work between the Rheumatologist and my RE, but I’ll look back and check to see if that was ever checked. Thank you!"
Yes look for an Endometriosis specialist if you can!
"Yeah, again, not sure I can explain it or even understand it correctly but search ""Neonatal Lupus and Sjogrens""."

"I always understood it to be my Sjogrens blood markers (I'm not sure what % of patients have them) that could cause neonatal lupus, not necessarily the fact that I have lupus."
My right eye is always worse. But my issue is just severe dryness which irritates the blood vessels on my eyeball
I’ve had this and for me it was environment allergies adding inflammation to my sjögrens. Since moving to a state without those allergies I don’t have swollen eyelids anymore while using prescription drops.
Were your meibomius glands checked out? It’s likely one of your eyes has more atrophied meibomius glands than the others.
"It’s my right one too, for some reason"
What kind of allergens? This could be my problem but I’d need to know for sure before I up and leave ha
Very very interesting. I’ll check into this.
They can’t refuse you if you ask for a referral.

"Go in with a clear list of your symptoms , how it affects your daily life (inability to thrive) and how it would give you piece of mind to know how to manage it."

"I don’t know your personal case but definitely reiterate the reasons WHY you need this referral, how the symptoms affect you and the impact they have on your day to day life. A referral to a specialist can help narrow any other disorders that may have overlapping symptoms."

"Best of luck, be persistent."

Edit for clarity

Also add a timeline if that helps. Possibly book a 20 minute slot if you can
My GP did a blood test after we'd both discussed the possibility of Sjogren's being my diagnosis. The Consultant Rheumatologist needed the positive blood test before he would see me.
also if you have dry mouth push for lip biopsy if you do not have Postive antibodies. Very few people test positive for Sjoggrens antibodies but you have a better chance of capturing it with  biopsy
"Thank you, I really appreciate it"
"I did exactly this (also UK-based) and I'm currently waiting on the results of a blood test. I have previously been tested for low vitamin D and things like that, but this panel is apparently supposed to test to check if there are any autoimmune-related issues."
"I put Vaseline on a q-tip and coat the inside of my nostrils. It feels amazing when your nose is super dry. Also try to always have a humidifier going in your house. My doctor recommends keeping the air humidity between 50-60% for sjogrens patients to help with eye, nose, and skin dryness."
"Try Ponaris drops. Work great. Tilt head back, couple of drops coat mucosal lining. Amazon carries product."
they make a saline nasal gel that works better for me then the sprays

Sleeping with a humidifier pointed at me and taking steamy showers (waiting until after shower to turn exhaust fan on) has helped me some
I got nasal oil :I but im not really satisfied with it. I might ask for gel the next time
thanks so much for this advice!
Alternative to steamy showers is a personal steam inhaler. https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vicks-personal-steam-inhaler-vih200/ID=prod6363056-product
I don't have antibodies. A lip biopsy confirmed my diagnosis.
"If you're lucky enough to have options for Rheumatologists, I would definitely get a second opinion."
"Also male, also (relatively) young too. No antibodies, had to get diagnosed via lip biopsy."
[deleted]
Male here tested 4x and SS-A only showed up once...  I think it is far from a  conclusive test...
It could be as high as 50% false negatives according to some estimates.
&#x200B;

Tool to see recommendations depending on blood test.

Sjogrens's diagnoise is rough to get.  Neg tests are very common.

There is also a lot of controversy in the field about causes and effects for Sjogrens.

My Neuro-ophtomigiest is the one that first brought up Sjogrens.  He said it was because I mentioned I always seemed to get better when taking antibitoics.

There are doctors and research that indicate that Sjogrens is due to bacteria messing with vitamin d.  Other doctors dismiss them as quacks.

&#x200B;

"I've done a crazy amount of research on the topics.  I've learned, that you need to get as many data points as possible.  There are a lot of specialized blood tests for Sjogren's, beyond the normal ANA ones.     If you can, try and find a neruo-ophtomigiest that is familiar with Sjogrens."

&#x200B;

I had positive ANA 1:320 with speckled pattern. Negative on every other blood test.  Had Lip Biopsy last week. I get results Thursday.

I think its like only 30% actually have the antibodies. If you have sicca symptoms u need a biopsy. See a plastic surgeon for it for a better outcome IMO.
"Might have to chase one of those up, you had any issues with yours? (The lip after biopsy)"
Same
Thanks alot!
"Thanks mate will look into this, good luck for Thursday! Let me know how it goes if you remember"
I don think it is necessarily one cause. But I 100% believe infections are a cause of autoimmunity in many cases. Lyme Mycoplasma and others stealth pathogens do cause autoimmunity but can be hard to eradicate with short courses of ABX. Check out [Roadback.org](https://Roadback.org)   I also think mercury and other heavy metals   like high copper are notorious fo this as well but good luck getting an allopathic dr to help you detox from this.
"I have not had any long term issues. It healed quickly, but I had a lump in my mouth (they take a saliva gland, so lip means inside your mouth below your lower lip in my case) for a long time. One day I noticed it was gone."
My issues were triggered when I had a viral ear infection a few years back which is what makes me think it's autoimmune related
"could be - they are findig  autoimmunity seems to start with some damage to the autonomic center in. the brain which of course governs immune system. All kinds of things can cause brain damage. - emotional and physical trauma, infections like Lyme, toxins and viruses maybe like yours Certainly possible!"
I am dealing right now with the raised anxiety level (I've had issues with anxiety long before I was diagnosed though) and also very much not motivated lately.

"I wish I had advice for you, because I really want to try to work through these issues. For me, I feel like it's a vicious cycle with the anxiety and motivation. I'm anxious, so I don't want to do things, but then I'm not doing things which stresses me out and makes me anxious, which makes me not want to do things......"

"Anyway, that probably wasn't much help, but just letting you know I'm going through it as well and here if you need anything :)"
"100% know what this feels like. I started getting anxiety not long after my diagnosis (I was about 19) and I think a lot of it had to do with having a chronic condition. I find it difficult to have such an invisible illness, not only are the symptoms not clear to on-lookers, but when considered individually, a lot of the day-to-day symptoms we get seem quite minor - eg when i was first diagnosed I thought ""this isnt really an illness, its just an inconvenience"". It took 2 years of constant fatigue and missing work for me to realise that maybe its a little more than that. Headaches can be caused by dry eyes and fatigue, especially under fluorescent lights. The fatigue fuels anxiety and mood problems too, but it doesn't help that you have an invisible chronic illness hanging over your head either."

"I would recommend vitamin d/MCT oil/omega oil supplements. I've been taking them regularly of late and it has really helped with my motivation and mood, especially getting up in the mornings which is the worst part for me. CBD is also helpful for this and comes in a range of applications, from e-cig liquid to topical creams which can be great for dry skin and painful areas."
"Another thing I would recommend is that you try to practice non-judgement a lot more and set your expectations according to how you're feeling. When I get too tired to do anything the first thing I tend to do is beat myself up for all the tasks I'm not managing to complete as a result, be that in work, at home, social events etc. Go easy on yourself. Celebrate every tiny thing you do manage to do, even if it means writing a little list of everything that you've done in a day, eg; I got out of bed, I had a healthy breakfast, I had a shower, I collected the mail, etc. It also works the other way, where you can write yourself a list like this, with easy-to-manage tasks on it, and as you cross each one off you might just feel like you've accomplished something. As you get better at this you can always add things to your list or make the tasks more complex. The important thing to remember with keeping these lists is that you don't have to do EVERYTHING on there - even if you do 2 things on the list, that's still 2 more than if you hadn't bothered. Keeping lists (although it may seem quite boring) has really helped me with my mood immensely over the last few years. Between brain fog, fatigue and mood problems it really is the best way to still get something done."
"Sorry I ended up ranting a bit there haha I do feel quite passionate about lists, as sad as it may seem. Long story short - yes I totally get you, you are not alone in this :)"
"Headaches could be occipital neuralgia (ON), sjogren’s neuropathy causes cranial neuropathies - specifically ON. See a pain mgmt Dr and ask about a bi-lateral arterial block, not a greater occipital nerve block (not as effective)."
Definitely know what this feels like. Handled it on my own for a very long time. Can only suggest to go talk to your doctor about it. I was finally just medicated and it’s a night and day difference.
"I wake up with particularly bad headaches a couple of times a week. I assume that they're caused by lack of water while I sleep. I started on CBD oil a month ago & the difference has been amazing, wish I'd tried it years ago."
"I’ve been going through this exact thing lately too. I mean in general I have anxiety/depression issues but headaches and dizziness too on top of my usual symptoms. I’m trying to drink tons of water but still always feel cotton mouthed and eye-tired from straining them, which may be a contributing cause of the headaches."

I think its the weather. Winter sucks.
This was really insightful advice and I too will take it into consideration. I’m pretty sure i’m vitamin D deficient too which probably doesn’t help at all
"I got my levels checked by my doctors, all levels including iron, vit d, b vit complex etc.. they all came back ""normal""! But I do find that when I take supplements i just feel so much better. Not sure if its the fact that vitamin d supps are normally fat based and have some kind of cod liver oil/something omega-filled in them too, but either way its a difference of night and day when i take them regularly."

"I'm glad I could help :) after about 7 years with this condition I'm finally starting to feel like I'm on top of things and able to deal with it. Although, every time I say that I tend to get hit with a new symptom or problem that may or may not be sjogrens related and it puts my motivation levels right back to 0. It sure is an up-hill battle and not one that really goes away :( I just tell myself that its ok to not fight it sometimes and just let your body tell you what it needs."
"I also do hella yoga and i think this has helped shape my mindset, but it could be multiple factors."
I’m joining a weekly yoga class starting in March so hopefully it will help! Thanks again.
Had horrible flu like symptoms for a week anytime I exercised. Possibly fibromyalgia.

Getting past this was my biggest hurdle.   Adderrel is what worked for me.  Was prescribed for adhd.  But even more useful was fixing my fatigue.   Doesn't work as well as it once did.  But still helps for now.

&#x200B;
Interesting. So with the Adderral you're able to work out?
"Yea, it fixes the long recovery problem."

"In past I could work out well enough, but recovery time was 1-2 weeks."

"Now I'm usually good the next day, or at worst the day after."

"I suspect I have fibromyalgia, which often accompanies Sjogren.  But this is just my thought.  Still waiting on biopsy for actual conformation of Sjogren."

[https://www.redorbit.com/adhd-medication/](https://www.redorbit.com/adhd-medication/)
"My family doesn't try to tell me I don't have something but, in general, they act like I can just ignore it or work through things if I try hard enough or if I really wanted too. Especially sad, because I also have Lupus.  Lack of support, care, concern and understanding is one of my hardest obstacles.  (Even from doctors). I find for the most part, the only people that seem to understand are those going through serious chronic illnesses themselves."

"Try not to take your family's ignorance personally, and shop around for doctors who will truly listen."
"My mom did. She was watching Dr. Oz & he had a segment about mold. I was living in SF at the time & she felt that I was probably suffering from mold infestation & didn’t really have Sjögrens - even though my bloodwork was positive (both SSA & SSB) & I had swollen salivary glands, brain fog, etc. She’s since changed her mind; especially after one of her sisters was diagnosed."

"It’s hard for people to understand what we go through unless they have something similar. I feel like a flaming bag of garbage 97% of the time, but I “look okay”so obviously nothing is wrong with me . 😕"





Yes.  My wife suffered for years with undiagnosed Sjogrens and they accused her of hypochondria.

"With the diagnosis, she had her mother get tested and she's also positive.  She's not symptomatic, but it's something she has to watch."

"But, the relationship between them is ruined."

I think the stress of the relationship helped bring on the first full flair up.
"In no uncertain terms, yes, in regards to both my Sjogren's and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Both my mother and mother in law repeat the same stories."
"MIL: Doctors don't know everything, it took me 9 doctors to get diagnosed with Lyme Disease. You probably have Lyme."
"Mom: Ask your uncle about his misdiagnosed Multiple Sclerosis, it took years for the doctors to admit it was just normal aging pain!"

"There's a lot of innate doubt about invisible illnesses, at least with my parents generation."

"If my diseases had been diagnosed strictly on complaint of pains, or dryness, I would have question or doubt still also. However I have objective evidence via blood work and x-rays."

"I have learned it is useless and THANKLESS to try to convince your family of something I know to be real. It was a HUGE relief to be diagnosed for me, and treatment is a HUGE step. End of story."
"Not so much tell me, just act like I can keep going and going and going. I also have a mitochondrial deficiency so if I just keep going for days I crash and hard. If it lines up with a flare up I’m basically done for 3-4 days.  As I became more aware of the pattern I became more sensitive to how hard I go and focus on resting when my body wants to. My family is not so tolerant of that."


I took pictures of my stitched up lip after my lip biopsy. I just show people those when they try to give me crap about it.
Same here. They don’t acknowledge my limitations even though I’ve had the worst time accepting my new “”life” after diagnosis and having to learn to not push myself too hard like I used to do before I got really sick.
"They seem to notice that my sister is sick with her type 1 diabetes, but not me with my Endometriosis (multiple surgeries), Sjögren’s / lupus (my grandmother also had lupus), POTS, hives and rashes always, adrenal gland insufficiency (parents do not understand that I rely on a medication now to stay alive, Cortef because my adrenals no longer make cortisol), my thyroid is shot as I have Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism."

My family seems to think that I have none of these conditions . It hurts and it caused me so much stress anxiety and depression.

"I grieved the loss of my old self so much,"
"As I used to be such an over achiever and go getter, social and always working on something and seems destined to succeed in life. Now? It’s pathetic when I look at my life at age 34 and see nothing accomplished, nothing to show for these 34 years and I feel like a huge disappointment to not only my family but to myself."
"Sometimes, RARELY, but sometimes, dental problems may be covered under medical insurance if it's medically related.  Sjogren's is one such disease where depending on your insurance, State, specific medical situation, and how hard your dentist will work with insurance, some coverage may be available."

"My wife suffers from Sjorgren's, used to be an RN, at one time worked for an insurance company doing chart reviews, so had seen this during her career."

"We were unable to convince our medical insurance company, though.  But, it's worth investigating."
"I can't offer much advice except that if I need to drink after using mouth gel I find that using a straw helps preserve the gel around my teeth quite a bit.  It's a silly tip but might help.  Otherwise, I also chew a lot of xylitol gum throughout the day, and use Act brand kid's fruit mouthwash and toothpaste.  The fruit flavor doesn't irritate my tongue or dry my mouth and the Act brand has a higher fluoride content than the dry mouth specific products I was using."
Try dental schools or there is always Mexico. I know a ton of people who cross the border for dental care and they do just as good as a job and 1/3 of the price than in the US. I fortunately have replaced all my teeth with veneers. Best money I’ve ever spent.
"Try the therabreath line in conjunction with what you're using? I use them and can't stop talking them up, my dry mouth is relatively mild and can be managed with otc medications for now though. My dentist turned me onto them after we noted that my teeth are not doing so hot at avoiding cavities and they've been doing wonders to help so far."

"As for the dentist, call around and explain your situation, I've never had issues with having more than one cavity taken care of at the same time unless they were on opposite sides of the mouth. A dental school might be a really good place to try getting into, we do have more interesting mouths than the average patient!"

Edit: I forgot a word
"Out of curiosity, how long was it between your Sjogren's diagnosis and your RA diagnosis?  The reason I ask is because I was diagnosed with Sjogrens at 27, and was told that because of how advanced my Sjogren's was at that age that it was likely that we would need to keep an eye out for other autoimmunities.  Still nothing thus far, but we test every year."
"I was in for a cleaning today and my dentist suggested Biotene products (but forgot to give me a sample, sigh). You could also ask your rheumatologist about pilocarpine to increase saliva production."
[deleted]
"Unfortunately, I don’t have dental insurance, so copays don’t apply. However, my dentist has done two fillings and a crown in one visit."

"My teeth have literally been falling apart for the last 10 years. I had to have two front teeth replaced with veneers, tops of my bottom front teeth have cracked, one needed a filling on the top of the tooth, a filling in the tooth next to the front ones. The stuff in this paragraph was in the last two years alone."

"I’ve also been prescribed Restasis, and didn’t like it. I use Xiidra now, and it’s helped more. I could use new glasses every year, but no vision insurance, either."
Ugh I know what you mean my teeth crumble and decay at the just thought too. All we can do is try to slow the decay by keeping some moisture in there. Do you use mouth sprays? I go through so many bottles of the biotene spray I love that stuff. And I’d say drink water before brushing and try to go as long as you can without drinking so it can sit on your teeth for a bit! You should stay very well hydrated of course but it’s actually bad to sip water constantly because it washes away any saliva which is more moisturizing and has minerals our teeth need and yadda yadda.

But even though I’m sooo careful and brush after eating sugar and try to keep my mouth from being too dry I still have had like 15 root canals....ridiculous. (Though I’m sure the years of not knowing I had it did a lot of damage). Thank god my dad has been able to help me with my dental bills or I would be screwed. :( hope you can find something that helps!
"That is a good thought. I have my doubts as my employer is now officially self-insured and cutting corners to reduce costs. Furthermore the previous insurance provider would not fill a script for Xiidra, a common eye drop for Sjogren's."

"I'll investigate regardless, thank you."
"I have heard of that happening, but since I'm in Pennsylvania, the travel and time off costs would definitely offset the value of Mexico."

"I'll look into dental schools, I had never considered that."

Unfortunately with poor enamel veneers are out of the question... I'm looking into crowns for my front teeth though. I already have 5 near or at the front! It's insane!
Yeah I’ve even had two root canals done on one side before. They should definitely be able to do more than one tooth a visit!
"Simultaneous, actually, though Sjogren's is still primary. It was determined through blood work done. Ive had 8 different types of analyses done on my blood. Even though many of the tests point a vague finger at one autoimmune disease or the other, my results were so high above the high end of all the normal ranges, that he and my general practitioner had no doubt. An opthalmologist also weighed in, giving a lot of insight to the severe eye symptoms I have. I also had X-rays of my hands and feet, the bones near my knuckles are such a way that suggests early onset RA."

"Interestingly enough, I'm 27. It did take 6 or 7 months to have everything done though."
"They’re at Walmart! They have a mouth wash, mouth spray, mouth gel, and lozenges. I use the biotene mouth spray all the time I love it. It’s really nice to have at night. I don’t use lozenges that often (I don’t know why I probably should) but I really like the ACT brand ones."
"Prevident 5000. It was difficult to pick up, as in not readily available at my typical pharmacies."
"Same, have had four of my front teeth crowned or bridged in the last year and a half. Two more are veneers but that was many years ago. The Christmas before last while I was on my way to visit family in another state one of my front teeth broke in half...what a fun autoimmune disease we have lol"
"Don't take this the wrong way but, I'm so glad to hear of someone else with the same struggle!! Tooth aesthetics are so important in the world I (we?) live in so it actually feels shameful to have bad looking teeth! I'll get some Biotene products this week."
"Yeah that makes since, you definitely should look into dental schools, my dad goes the the university in our city all the time and has never had a problem: ) good luck"
Thanks! I'll check for it.
"I get it from my dentist.  I keep it at work and use it only after lunch to make it last.  Remember not to rinse after brushing with it.  I use a  Sonicare toothbrush at home with sensitive brush head and keep a Quip brush for using at work.   It’s a bit obsessive I know, but you can have brain surgery cheaper than a lot of dental work.   I work at a medical university with a dental college and have good insurance, so I’ve been lucky...so far."
I broke my front tooth on Christmas Eve on a Swedish fish. It was mortifying.
"Hot showers. Heating pads. Yoga/stretches and walking really help, too. I also use an electric blanket on the bed and start it up a good 30 minutes before I get into bed. It heats the mattress up and really helps ease my muscles before falling asleep."
CBD bath salt has made a huge difference on bad days for me!
"Daily Stretching, Stretch those things out and ensure proper hydration replacing electrolytes."
"I like magnesium ""oil"" (it's actually a magnesium-rich salt dissolved in water). I put it on my arms and legs, neck and shoulders, rub it in a bit and let it dry. Super relaxing. It feels a bit like getting out of the ocean, but the magnesium makes me a little sleepy - so I only do it before bed or when I don't have anything to do for a few hours."
magnesium works wonders.

"For me, a around of antibiotics also helped a lot."
Magnesium glycinate. Kal and Doctor's Best are good brands. Bed Buddy microwavable rice heater (you can make your own). Massage. Foam rolling. Occasionally ibuprofen.
Also I fasted for a month.  Resets the immune system.  plus lost 30 pounds.
I had two strokes (a CVA and a TIA) that are believed to have been caused by autoimmune related inflammation. Both happened in the year leading up to my Sjogren's diagnosis. The consensus among my medical team is that the undiagnosed autoimmune disease was causing such severe flare ups and elevated levels of inflammation that it triggered bouts of vasculitis extreme enough to impede my blood flow enough to allow tiny clots to form.
Sorry that happened to you.  May I ask what your prognosis is?

"Oh great. I have the DVT gene, too. I can't take Plaquenil, so being diagnosed won't really affect that for me."
My doctor thinks that my stroke risk is being well managed. I'm on an aspirin and plavix regimen to prevent blood clots should I have more vasculitis episodes. The Plaquenil is helping reduce the frequency and duration of flare ups so that helps decrease risk too.
> I get terrible tingling and burning in my hands and feet

Sjogrens can often come with neuropathy. You'll want to see a neurologist to determine how bad it is.

The biggest thing I found is that you'll need to be prepared to start noticing symptoms you never noticed before and wonder if you're making it up or not.  You're not. Its crazy what you notice when you start understanding that what you thought was normal isn't.

&#x200B;
Try eating an anti inflammatory diet : )
"Check out ""Sjogrens Strong"" Lupe shares her 10 years of experience with Sjogren's. they have a website, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and you can subscribe to the show in iTunes or google play, NO COST."

It is a strong growing community for those with Sjogren's
I completely agree about the symptoms that you never noticed before. I had complete weakness on my left side for a week. My muscles felt like they were being shredded like the way you would do to chicken. Now they have me on gabapentin and its definitely helping. I was so used to the other autoimmune diseases that this once just took me by surprise. I never imagined something else could arise that would make me miss the other diseases. The fatigue alone is enough without all of the other symptoms.
"So, for fatigue you'll probably have to do some trial and error.  Some people find that dietary irritants (sugar, gluten, dairy, etc.) can cause issues.  If you're up for it try cutting them out one by one and see how it goes.  I find that while I'm able to manage on a ""normal"" diet I do way better on a low carb diet."
"I had severe weakness, too, at two different times, two years apart. My GP didn't behave as if he believe me."
"Me too, and I fucking love carbs. But my focus and concentration and pain are way better when I am making a few ketos. I'm not drastically keto, but keeping to 60-150 grams a day makes me feel a whole lot better."
That’s amazing!  We’re all curious what drops are working for you?
"That is a key detail I didn't include, sorry. PolyVisc lubricating eye ointment."
"A plastic surgeon did mine. It seemed like forever for the lump inside where it healed to go away. One day I just noticed it wasn't there. I have not had any long term complications, and my mouth dryness didn't get worse as a result. My antibodies are persistently negative - the lip biopsy is the only way I was diagnosed. It was an outpatient procedure."

I don't personally know of any other tests. Good luck.
Seronegative Sjogren's is a thing.
"I see a research rheumatologist and she did salivary gland ultrasound as well as testing spit volume and flow. (I was previously diagnosed via blood work.) While they aren't diagnostic, someone experienced with these tests could use them to help build a case based on the symptoms. According to her, the ultrasound will likely become a future method of diagnosis, so if your glands are infiltrated, it should be evident."
What is the benefit of the biopsy if the treatment is the same?  It’s not like there’s a cure so why take the risk?
"I did mine two weeks ago today and still a little sore but not too bad, btw they sent my sample to a different lab for a second opinion and I haven’t gotten the results yet, anyone experienced the same thing?"
My rheumatologist recommended against any biopsies since the treatment would be the same for me either way. IDK if an official diagnosis would mean something to your insurance or treatment. For me it didn't matter so I opted for no further testing.
Thanks for your responses. Well the treatment will be IVIG. I will not go on Methotrexate and friends but IVIG i would consider b/c it does seem to reverse symptoms in some. I have autonomic and small fiber neuropathy with POTS - i have disabling fatigue. I have been trying to reverse this disease. Been autoimmune paleo and now keto for a long time 7 + yrs.  It helps to avoid certain foods but hasnt been curative. My Sjogrens symptoms are getting worse. So if IVIG were to help me it is something I might consider if insurance covers it  I think that is why he wants the biopsy b/c he can usually make a case since i'll have 2 AI conditions.  I don't know if insurance will consider ultrasound - that would be great. Ill ask him. My neuro runs and autonomic lab and follows Cleveland and mayo clinc's protocols for dx so I doubt he will waiver and I don't want to piss him off too much but Im also not sure I dont want to try other things first before IVIG. I just dont know if I dont get IVIG soon I may have irreparable damage so hard to decide. I feel our bits and pieces are precious and needed so I like to hold on to as much of me as possible.    haha Thanks again for your insights.
Biopsy was done by plastic surgeon and was not bad. No pain from injection or even after and I took nothing not even Advil.no long term numbness. I just miss my poor sweet glands.
Same!
good to know - he runs and autonomic lab and is pretty by the books so Ill pray he will consider - i think he needs to make an insurance case for IVIG - but not sure i even want that. I know I dont want methotrexate
I felt the same way. Decided against the biopsy as what exactly is the end game?  Immunosuppressive drugs?  I won't take them so 🤷‍♀️

"I did an elimination diet and found that if I don't eat nuts I'm 90+% better.  I already don't eat grains, but was OD-ing on the peanut butter and almond flour stuff probably to try to compensate.  I know I have lucked out.  Fingers crossed it stays dormant."
"☝🏼 THIS. How is this even still a thing?! Why, tho?"

"I just got my ANA test after testing positive for RF, that was pretty much it."

"The only sort of ‘invasive’ test I’ve taken is the Schirmer’s test (which is kind of silly because I cried from the pain the first time, so the results were inconclusive LOL). Last time my rheumatologist ordered the Schirmer’s test from the hospital ophthalmologist just to make sure everything was in order before I switched from Imuran to another medication, Hydroxychloroquine (which side-effects’ include colour-blindedness, although cases are rare). I agreed to it because it was necessary."

"The only thing I get done now is my quarterly bloodwork, but I’m so used to needles by now, not that it’s ever scared me really, so meh. Biopsies creep me out, tho."

How is this lip biopsy necessary for you? It sounds risky and nerves are precious! Don’t let people mess around with your nerves for no good reason. ✨
what did they recommend to you? My neuro likes IVIG if its approved by insurance. Thats all Id consider from a immune modulating point of view
what is your treatment?
"hey, do you have any more info on the elimination diet?"
I have Pernicious anemia which exacerbates the dryness when my b12 is low. So for that I take b12 shots and supplement with vit d and methylated folate. For the Sjogrens I have fresh kote eye drops I put in before I go to sleep and other eye drops during the day. I use eucerin intense healing lotion every day and I use xylemelts for dry mouth. Sometimes I go to sleep with them in my mouth.
"I was low carb so already no grains, legumes, sugars, etc. but started getting dryer and dryer mouth and just living on Biotene.  As I wrote above, I realized my issues coincided with my nut intake dramatically increasing (everything low carb seems to be made of almonds) so I ate only meat and greens for a few weeks and the dryness went away (!) so I started adding things back and found that sadly almonds and peanuts were the culprit for me.  There's a book called ""Plant Paradox"" by Dr Gundry ... It really explains how lectins can wreak havoc on your immune system, so it makes sense to me that they could cause an autoimmune reaction."

I hope that helps and best of luck in your healing process!
"That helps a lot, I'll check out the book. Thank you!"
"My name is Denise. I was diagnosed with Sjögren’s eleven years ago. The rheumatologist that oversaw my care put me on steroids for five years. When I stopped that course of treatment, both of my hips and a vertebrae in my spine crumbled. I am 55 years old, and now have two artificial hips, as well as rods and screws in my back. I have changed rheumatologists, but the damage of poor medicine cannot be undone."

"My name is Shay. When I was diagnosed with Sjogrens I had a lot of complaints, but the first thing that my doctor sent me for was the last thing on my mind - my hands."

"They hurt often and I'd taken to rubbing at them when I was anxious, but I worked with my hands a lot and was a dedicated crafter so I figured it was just normal soreness from overuse. I've never been very coordinated so the decrease in functionality didn't send up any red flags.  Apparently they were quite swollen the day I saw her because she was extremely concerned.  She sent me for an X-ray and a MRI as well as some neuropathy testing.  We found out that I have periarticular osteopenia, which is a fancy way of saying bone loss in my hands.  My very low bone density coupled with the loss of much of my cartilage in my hands from inflammation had deteriorated things to the point that you could see the bone loss and whiskering cracks on the X-ray very visibly.  I also have neuropathy in my hands such that I can only barely feel temperature changes and pressure."

"After being diagnosed I had to relearn what ""normal"" function looked like in my hands, and I had to learn how to protect them.  When my Sjogren's inflammation flares up I fumble and drop things more often.  My hands sometimes feel like they are overstimulated and it becomes very unpleasant to hold things like wood and metal.  I have to wear gloves even while just cleaning the house because the stress on my hands from sweeping or mopping too long will make it difficult to use my hands for a while.  I have arthritis in both hands which flares up from time to time even without any particular triggering event. I often pick up very hot things without realizing I'm burning myself."

"I've needed to make choices about what activities I would and would not allow myself to do.  I used to very much enjoy knitting and adult coloring books, but both of those things trigger my arthritis so I decided to focus on other hobbies.  I'll not pretend that I used to enjoy mowing my lawn, so it wasn't a hard choice to pay a service to do my yard-work for me.  Everything has an associated cost/risk analysis.  If I carry in the heavy groceries is that going to mean that I don't have the hand strength to chop the vegetables for dinner?  Every chronic illness patient probably sees this type of assessment mirrored in their own day to day decisions."

"I guess what really gets me about hands is that their every function feels so very physical and the idea of a life without hands makes me feel helpless.  I already see myself having to sit on the sidelines of my life to save myself pain.  Having to stand around and watch while my SO helps a friend move, having to wait until my SO gets home to retrieve something from the attic because I don't trust my hands to keep me securely on the ladder, having to let someone else do all the little fiddly work that pops up in every day life over and over, and so on. Its maddening and infuriating and victimizing all at once."

"It worries me, how much more decline in my dexterity I might see in 10+ years and what that might mean for the choices I have to make for myself. But then the same thoughts occur to me when I think about my bad knees and my decreasing saliva production and my brain fog and fatigue. We can only try make the best decisions for ourselves in the now and hope for the best futures possible."

&#x200B;
"My name is Jocelyn. I should have been diagnosed 15 years ago but the doctors I visited thought that I was just ""an stressed teenager"". I wonder if being diagnosed earlier would have save me the pain I am feeling today. There is always a bright sight, though, and I have learned to listen to my body and not trust blindly in doctors. They are as human as we are."

Thank you so much for sharing! I will send you the link to the series when it’s posted next Tuesday 😊
"Thank you so much for sharing! I will send you the link to the series when it’s posted next Tuesday. I love how open you were, this will really give people awareness."
Thank you for sharing Jocelyn 😊 I will post the video as soon as it’s up.
Thank you Ashley for sharing. I really do appreciate you being open. I will be posting your story on December 11th cuz my stories are full for December 4th. Thank you again 🙏🏼
I look forward to reading it!
"Just wondering if your looking for participants world wide? You ask for contact information, not sure whither to start it or not, I live in Scotland?"
I tried to but the link doesn't work
Yes I am looking for participants world wide!
Hi there! Unfortunately that happens when used on certain devices! Go ahead and try this: https://unlcba.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0k8HddILaao9HkV

I stick tampons in my nose. I am also a male
"What I do is probably not medically recommended, but it works for me. I find breathing deeply through my nose stops a nosebleed pretty quick. I figure the air moving quickly over the small cut causes it to scab over faster. YMMV, proceed at your own risk."
"I would suggest going to a good rheumy but definitely go on local boards etc for your area and try to find one that is knowledgeable. Sjogren's is serious but can be well-managed. Many rheumys don't know enough or don't take it as seriously as they should. If you ever need online resources I love the Hopkins Sjogrens site. Very reputable. If you are local to there, go there."
"That’s a crappy doctor. Do you have medical insurance? Call them and ask for a recommendation for a rheumatologist.  Also, check out [The Sjogren’s Syndrome Foundation](https://www.sjogrens.org/) for a ton of information."
If ur GP won't give u a recommendation you might try getting your test results and calling rheumatologist and explaining your situation and sending over the results.

"Also urgent care could probably give u one if u go, I would also have test results in hand when u visit them."
"See anew doctor. My doctor doesn't know anything about it, and doesn't even bother trying but still disagrees with me when I mention my symptoms might be related to the sjogren's and not say, anxiety. My rheumatologist is great though."
PM me if you want more info.
I do have insurance. I am gonna do that actually
"Definitely possible to test positive and not notice the symptoms. It happened to me. Like you, I had testing done while pregnant. I’m now 4 years from diagnosis. I didn’t really notice much at first, but as time has gone on I’ve started noticing the dry eyes and mouth. I can’t talk long without moistening my mouth. I’m also starting to get to the point where it’s a challenge to swallow dryer foods. Crackers are the worst. At my last eye exam, my tears cleared in 8 sec and normal is 12. It’s a slow progression but for now I treat with over the counter mouthwash and eye drops. I suspect that will change over time."
Two things.

"One, lupus and Sjogren's look the same on the ""tests"" in the fact that they share the same markers and the presence of antibodies can mean either/or/or both."

"That said, symptoms of lupus and Sjogren's are not fully documented and vary wildly from individual to individual. Dry eyes and dry mouth weren't even on my radar when I was diagnosed in my thirties; those are just starting to hit me up right now (mid-forties). You can have the disease and be asymptomatic or have vastly different symptoms than what the literature says can happen. My biggest symptoms until recently have been chronic low back problems, random joint and bone craziness, liver pain/swelling, and some hair thinning. There are a lot of symptoms that most doctors don't associate with Sjogren's that are starting to work their way into the literature, and will take some time to work into the doctors' radars."
"Diagnosed this year, March-ish, 38 male, no symptoms until a couple months ago when the dry eyes started and mainly at night. Waking up in the middle of the night with eyes so dry you HAVE to get up to put eye drops in.  As far as I know/can tell, that's my only symptom. More annoying right now than painful... For now."

"Develop a plan with your rheum, focus on what you can control."
"I'm asymptomatic most of the time unless I have a ""flare"" and unless it's super bad, like I have a lot of pain, I wouldnt even notice, because a mild flare for me is just a little more eye and mouth dryness. If you keep the inflammation in your body down it may never be an issue."
Disclaimer: doctors still disagree about my diagnosis- I definitely have autoimmune something and I’m somewhere on the lupus-Sjögren’s spectrum and I also have positive Antiphospholipid antibodies...

Back when I first started seeing a rheumatologist I didn’t really think about my dry eye/dry mouth because it wasn’t my main symptom by far. Main complaints were soul-crushing fatigue and joint pain. Then when they brought up Sjögren’s I started to realize things I thought were just normal because they came on gradually were not actually normal. Like I could never wear contacts but I never really thought about why (extreme dry eyes) and at 29 I have 2 dental implants and more fillings than I can count (dry mouth). I had chronic “vaginitis” that doctors couldn’t figure out (no yeast or BV) (extreme vaginal dryness). It just took a rheumatologist to put it all together.
"When my blood tested positive for the antibodies I had dry eyes, but I never had dry mouth at all.  Most of my symptoms where joint pain, fatigue, and extreme brain fog.  When we did objective testing, however, my Schrimer's tear test came back normal while my salivary gland testing came back abnormal."

"Now, about a year and a half after my diagnosis I'm noticing the dry mouth a lot more often and have started using Biotene (mouth wash) before bed and when I wake up  to help with the dryness in my throat after sleeping.  I've also been doing water aerobics and water yoga since before I was officially diagnosed."

"Everyone is just a little bit different in what symptoms express themselves and the severity.  For me, fatigue and joint pain are still the #1 symptoms I contend with, but because I was diagnosed so early (27) I had a chance to start treating the dry mouth and dry eye as soon as I started seeing them become a problem and I started on Plaquenil, which has helped slow the progression."
"Thank you so much for responding, I appreciate it. And I'll have to edit my post, I'm not currently pregnant even though I don't think that's relevant at the moment, lol"
"Wow, this was very helpful, thank you!"
"For the night-time dry eyes, the nighttime ointment has been a godsend."
It does matter! There are some concerns with Sjogren's and pregnancy that I never committed to memory because I was already done with kid making. I'll see if I can find some info.
You're welcome!
I’m very curious about that and would love some information if you have some...
I just went through all this. There’s a higher risk for a heart block. It basically means the timing is off and could mean surgery or pacemaker once born. I had to see a Maternal Fetal doc (aka high risk). They did ultrasounds weekly from week 26-32 or something. There’s also a smaller chance that the baby could have Neonatal Lupus. My daughter had that. It showed up about week 6-8. It was just the Lupus spots with no other lupus complications. She did end up having hydrocephalus which is an extremely rare complication of Neonatal Lupus. Everything was resolved by 6 mo.
I can't recall everything but please check with your Dr if you are planning on getting pregnant. I think there's an anti phospholipid antibody blood marker thing that's related to some autoimmune diseases that can cause miscarriages (that may be preventable with meds). So please do run stuff by your dr.
"I asked my Rheum this question a couple years ago. His explanation was something along the lines of: Plaquenil, when taken consistently and growing over time, changes the pH in the cell organelles where proteins are broken down which trigger immune responses' This retards the ability of the immune system to define those proteins for further attack, dampening the impacts of an overactive immune response- most specifically reducing the fatigue associated with that overreaction. I am sure I misremember some of this. I am also sure that I am not qualified to judge the accuracy of this. But by Rheum has been great and I respect all he has done for me. And I also believe that my fatigue has abated since taking Plaquenil. If it's a placebo effect, I'm fine with that."

"If I'm not mistaken and some new study has proven otherwise very recently, Plaquenil is not known to be effective at doing anything to help Sjögren's Syndrome patients. Doctors often say that it ""may"" improve fatigue after three to six months on the medication, though nothing to support that."

"> Four trials with totals of 215 SS patients, including two randomized controlled trials, one double blind crossover trial and one retrospective open-label study, were analyzed in this review. For dry mouth and dry eyes, the effectiveness of HCQ treatment was essentially the same as placebo treatment. For fatigue, the effectiveness of HCQ was lower than placebo. The efficacy of HCQ in treating pain associated with pSS was superior to that of the placebo. There was no significant difference between HCQ-treated groups and controls in terms of Schirmer test results, but HCQ could reduce the erythrocyte sedimentation rate compare with placebo."

"[From this Plaquenil review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5427554/). As you can see, the only tangible improvement was the possibility of a reduction in one's ESR."

"I have a terribly advanced case of SS. My personal experience with Plaquenil, which I took for four years starting at diagnosis, was that it did nothing to improve any aspect of the disease. The progression of SS, if anything, amplified during this time. I'm also left with [permanent hyperpigmentation](https://imgur.com/jUc37nS) on my forearms. I apologize; That's a crummy image and it's difficult to see the spots, but one is the size of a penny."
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5427554/


I take anyway because I don't have may negative side effects and I for some reason have it in my head that I'll end up with RA eventually on top of the others and this can help slow its progression.
It’s supposed to slow the progression of the disease. To prevent organ involvement. But I read this on a Facebook page....

"Personally though since taking hydroxychloriquine sulfate, no return of vasculitis in my feet and an improvement of my fatigue. No help with dry eyes. I take Xiidra for that."
Thank you for addressing this for me. I’ve taken Plaquinil for years with no understanding of its benefit to me regarding my Sjögren’s.
I have terrible hyperpigmentation on my forearms too.
I'm sold.
This is the best explanation i've heard / read about the drug. thanks!
Could you tell me what other treatment or medication you tried instead? Thanks in advance

Yes. My rheumatologist said it does. I’ve been on it for 6 years. 🙁
My wife has had something similar that was diagnosed as Costochondritis.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costochondritis
**Costochondritis**

"Costochondritis, also known as chest wall pain, costosternal syndrome, or costosternal chondrodynia is an acute and often temporary inflammation of the costal cartilage, the structure that connects each rib to the sternum at the costosternal joint. The condition is a common cause of chest pain. Though costochondritis often resolves on its own, it can be a recurring condition that has little or no signs of onset."

Costochondritis symptoms can be similar to the chest pain associated with a heart attack.

"That's what they said it was, which is just inflammation in the joints in your chest. Could that be caused by sjogrens"
"Yup. Went to the hospital with chest pain, came out with costochondritis."
"Yes.  Since it's essentially an arthritis type condition, it's one of the many things sjogren's can do at least in my wife's situation."

"I would not say it's ""just"" inflammation.  It's very painful.  My wife described it as having all of your ribs broken and it hurts every breath."
"Oh trust me, yeah, I'm not dismissing that pain. I was out of commission for about a week"
It felt to me like I had a plate pressing hard against the middle of my chest.
"This is a good sub, though a little slow, and there's also Sjogren's World forum with people who can relate. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=ae219a27c76c35bf21616c0ea01cf51f&board=1.0"

"Is anyone interested in starting a spoonie community on Slack (a free chat app)? It is a wonderful support group system that has an easy interface and chatroom aspect makes it easy to talk with each other all day long.

33 F diagnosed in '16. I just wanted to say my heart goes out to you and you are so not alone.
"I would really much like to chat with OP and you too! I’m 25 y old female (26 next month) and was diagnosed four years ago also. What do you people think about making a group chat for the three of us? Obviously other people could join if they wanted, but this idea just came to my head!"

"Hey! I made a chat and added you both, can you see it?🙃"
I have this problem. I also randomly choke on my own saliva or the air or something.

I drink a lot of water while eating and there are some foods I just don't eat. Steak or smoked sausage with skin is a no go.  I can eat steak if it is cooked in the crock pot and shredded.

I take a lot of herbal supplements and have sometimes gotten them stuck in my throat making me throw up. Not sure if it's just due to dry mouth but since it only happens some of the time I have always wondered if there is swelling that I have just gotten used to so It doesn't feel any different until time to swallow.


"This happens to me, too. I can't eat without lots of water."

"Besides dryness, fatigue has been my most debilitating symptom. Sometimes it's more mild. Sometimes it's bone crushing and debilitating. I also have started to have some damage to my teeth. I used to have a lot of muscle and joint pain but I started cymbalta and that has helped. My heart goes out to you and I hope you can see someone soon to get some help."
I get muscle aches and pain in my calves and forearms. It's really weird and my rheumy hasn't had any of his other patients with that symptom. It happens the most when I've had a stressful day. I'll wake up the next day and it will feel like I climbed a mountain the day before. Most of the time it will be really bad for one day and quickly taper off.

Medical bills are the #1 reason for filing for bankruptcy.
Are they painful?
"The average time it takes to get diagnosed is measured in years, not days, unfortunately. You have to be in the middle of a flare up for it to appear positive on tests, which is why people don't get diagnosed for a long time. Hang in there."

In the meantime you can switch to an anti-inflammatory diet and begin taking vitamins and supplements as if you had been diagnosed.
"Yes, you could still have Sjogren's despite negative bloods. It's called seronegative Sjogren's syndrome."
"There is an ""early"" Sjogren's test that is only done by 1 lab in the country.  Your insurance may not pay for it."
I have no Sjogrens markers in my bloodwork. diagnosed in '16 with a lip biopsy. Personally I didn't think the lip biopsy was bad. It hurt afterwards but I wanted to know for sure.
"Seconding this. I was nervous for the biopsy, but I found it to be on par with a cavity filling. After anaesthetics the procedure only took a few minutes. Let me know if you would like any more details!"
"So far my rheumatologist has discouraged my getting a biopsy, but I’d really like to be able to get a solid diabnosis and perhaps on SSDI."

Why has your rheumy discouraged it?
"I don't really know. When she said one of my last tests was borderline pos. (all former tests were neg.), I said ""Well, I guess it's time for the lip biopsy?"""

"She said, ""No, let's try Plaquinil and see how that goes. The treatment's going to be the same either way."""

But I need to have a firm diagnosis. I want to apply for disability. I'm worried that any day my insurance and health care options could vanish (U.S.er here).
Curcumin for joint pain. It's an anti-inflammatory and active ingredient in turmeric. I like NatureWise brand.

Magnesium glycinate for muscle pain. KAL and Doctor's Best are good brands.

Plaquenil can also help with joint and muscle pain if you want to go the prescription route.
[deleted]
"I use Salon Pas with lidocaine for muscle spasms in my back and shoulders, and I take epsom salts baths which actually raised my magnesium levels into the normal range! The magnesium citrate in epsom salts is absorbed through the skin and has an immediate effect that is magnified by the relaxing warm bath."

"I use an herbal comfrey root/arnica blend for sore muscles and bruises. I don't know why, but it works really well if I have the energy to rub it in when I need it. Some of this herbal stuff is crap, but some things, like this stuff, works great. I'm trying just arnica and it also is effective."

"Also, don't underestimate the moaning/grunt-emitting relief of a good heating pad. It's give you that mommed feeling even if your mother was Joan Crawford. It should come infused with ""Aroma of Chicken Soup You Wish She'd Made."""
How are you with anxiety?
My rheumy recommended turmeric and fish oil.
"I was prescribed cymbalta for my anxiety/depression and it has actually done wonders for my muscle pain as well. For whatever reason, my psychiatrist told me it helps with chronic pain and she was right. Also hot baths with Epson salt is great and very relaxing."
"awesome, thank you I'll have to check them out"
"I got anti inflammation steroids, but I want to try out celebrex. The Dr is concerned about my blood pressure going up though."
"I not much of a anxious person, it hasn't really changed"
"I've tried turmeric for a few weeks I really didn't notice much, and I've heard fish oil from a few people."
"Im taking Blood pressure medicines and it looks like it negatively reacts to BP, plus I don't have any anxiety or depression so I doubt they would prescribe it to me. But doesn't hurt to ask."
"Be careful with the steroids. A lot of negative side effects, and some permanent, especially with long term use."
[deleted]
"I'm hoping to get her input for the steroids anti inflammation. I wouldn't want to take them all the time just when the pain really is bad. Like right she doesn't really want me take nsaids for it cause it raises my BP. But I'm also going to ask her about celebrex and see what my options are. I would hate to gain all the weight I've lost with the steroids, and I certainly don't want anything to shrink."
"I hope I do, if I do I'll update it and hopefully it'll help others to deal with the pain."
[deleted]
Name Brand plaquenil really helped with certain joint pain. Think of it like this: with generic I had 5 places that join/muscle pain with the name brand its down to 2 places. not 100% better but better none the less. And prednisone takes all the pain away for at least 15hours 40mg.
"Yes, prednisone makes everything better. :) Unfortunately the longterm side effects can be brutal. So I'm glad you found another option!"
I only use it when it's unbearable or do a day trip.

I just hope it'll help someone else do they don't have to go through what I have already
Sjogrens and lupus are very similar. I actually have a friend who has both. I've been diagnosed since I was 25 (after 12+ years of trying to get diagnosed. I'm now 26).

It does depend on the severity of the Sjogrens you have.
"There is a ""good""  and a ""bad"" severity of Sjogrens. Personally mine is the severe or ""bad"" one so much to the point I have had to get on disability. I also have had similar ear problems like you have mentioned,ever since I was a kid. If I remember right it is connected to Sjogrens. Along with nose bleeds, chronic fatigue, etc...."

There is a really good website the Sjogrens Foundation has that explains a lot of the symptoms and has articles about how to manage your symptoms that you might be interested in looking at. Also there is a research place in Oklahoma called the OMRF (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) that is actually performing a case study on Sjogrens that might help you out with testing. That's where I had mine done and they did it all for free.

Hope some of that helps you. 😊. God bless.
I get pain in-front of my ears that is actually my saliva glands. They get swollen and hurt tons. I take Evoxac that helps me produce saliva and cuts back on this greatly.

I was diagnosed with sjogrens at 25 myself. 29 now.
"On the ear/jaw pain note, if your parotids are swollen, prednisone should take it down."

"I was diagnosed w sjogrens at 11, doc is wondering about lupus now due to fevers and severe joint pain."

"I will say I have had it pretty severely and I doubt I feel any worse than you do with Lupus. It's all about not taxing yourself, resting when needed, staying on top of meds."
Does it hurt and swell up when you eat/salivate?
"Check if you have intestine stuck or strangled in between abdominal muscles. Everytime my intestines get stuck, i have to push them back in when  It causes my symptoms. Once the intestine gets free back inside my body, my symptoms go away."
"There is a painless bulge. Once i push it back in, my symptoms go away until it gets stuck or tangled in another area later."
Thank you! I started doing a little research but then started freaking myself out with all of the different opinions. I didn’t realize there is a Sjogrens foundation. I appreciate you responding to my message. I’ve been in a haze since my doctor called. It’s comforting to know that there are people out there who understand.
Did you have trouble getting onto disability with sjogrens? Did you have another diagnosis? Some days are really hard. 😞
"Honest question, did you encounter any difficulty when attempting to get on disability? I've had Sjogrens progressing since I was about 6 or so and about 11 years ago it started to effect my joints so badly I'm lucky if I can walk more than 15 min. without falling down, but my state is giving me the run around about obtaining disability so some insight on the matter might help me."

Edit: My phone resolution is small and I didn't see your other posts regarding disability. I fear I cannot afford a lawyer though so now I'm dreading the situation even more.
I have that right now! It’s so bad on my left side currently that I have an obvious bulge. Is Evoxac a prescription? Or can I get it over the counter?
Oh yes. So much! Sometimes the pain is so bad the food doesn’t stick.
How can you tell? Do you have abdominal pain? Or is there an obvious bulge?
I have never heard of this before. Are there any pictures you can link to online that show this phenomenon? I would like to learn about it.
Hmmm... I don’t think I know my body well enough. I haven’t noticed any abnormal bulges. I’ll have to pay closer attention.
"Your welcome! I totally understand, when my Dr called me about Sjogrens my first thought was “what on earth is that?!?” There are also some good support groups on Facebook as well."
"I did have a hard time. I appealed twice and got denied then it went to court but I got a lawyer for that. It was finally approved I am now waiting for the award letter that will tell me how much I will get from disability and whatnot. I’m not aware of being diagnosed with anything other than primary Sjogrens, but I do have the beginning of RA I think. They say it’s hard to get disability with Sjogrens unless you have a lawyer and in my case it’s true."

"I know what you mean I dread going to work. I have been at my job 6yrs but the unrelenting pain and fatigue is so bad I can only work 19-20 hours a week. Those days are without a doubt the worst of the worst days of my entire week. However, I’m trying Dr.Combra’s vit d protocol and am hoping it’ll help with the symptoms."
The only difficulty I had was getting approved. I had both my primary care and my rheumatologist send letters in that helped a lot I believe because when I went to court even the medical examiner agreed that I was disabled with Sjogrens well that and I’ve been all over to mayo hospital and Scott &white trying to figure out what causes the swelling in my neck that’s the main area of pain in my body. All they were able to tell me was that Sjogrens was attacking some fat pads.

I’m not sure if it’s all lawyers or not but the one I have will get paid when I’m paid my back pay. The SSI has to back pay you from your first filing date for disability. The lawyer typically takes out a percentage so you don’t have to worry about paying them I know because I get $600 a month and there’s no way I could have afforded one myself.

Hope some of that helps you 🙂

"Edit: I forgot to mention that the SSI has what is called SGA limit per month  for how much you make a month. In order to also get approved you have to make under this limit (I think it’s $1700 this year, it changes from year to year) and you also have to work under 24 hours a week."
"It’s prescription. But honestly I couldn’t deal without it. I also find CBD lotion helps a lot, specially the ones with menthol, the combo is a wonder."
"It happened ever since i got a hernia and was provided a mesh surgery. Just look at types of hernia, and the pictures from google. Thats whats happening inside for me, but its not enough presure to pop through."
"For me i get severe dry mouth when my intestines get stuck in the lower abdominal pelvic muscle pockets. Once i push it free, the dry mouth goes away."
I have som CBD oil.... maybe I should put some on to try for some relief.
"I have primary sjorgrens - nerve damage is common, mine’s particularly bad (I have ‘small fiber neuropathy’ diagnosed via skin biopsy). I also developed dizziness, that’s gotten pretty bad too, but it’s managed for me with florinef (a horomone that makes my body retain salt), and eating a *lot* of salt (and probably not enough)."

"My understanding is that when dysautonomia is caused by something autoimmune like sjorgrens, it’s similar to the sensory neuropathy I’m also experiencing: the problem is that my body is attacking the ‘small’ nerve fibers - there are a, b, and c types of nerve fibers in your body. b and c types are partially and non “myelinated”, or covered by a lipid sheath."

Sensory nerves and autonomic nerves are made up of b and c type of fibers.

"If your body attacks those nerves, you can have trouble with pain and sensations (sensitivity, “over reactions” to stimulation, lightning, pins and needles, aching, fibromyalgia, etc), problems with digestion (constipation, acid reflux) , and problems with maintaining your blood pressure."

"The good news is that the un-myelinated fibers can recover once the cause of the damage is controlled - this is why it will cycle sometimes, along with flare ups."

Disclaimer: not a neurologist :)
"I would look into Dysautonomia, common problem in patients with sjogrens. There are lifestyle changes such as increasing salt and fluids, as well as medications to help manage symptoms."
Very helpful ty. I've also had blood pressure issues so I guess that's related as well.
"Hi there, I was diagnosed last October, was a year ago this week.  It all started due to rashes that would not go away.  This past August I had the extreme pain in my solar plexus area, which was crazy radiating depending on movement.  It ended up being costochondritis."
"Just wanted to say hey, and take care."
I hope you find a great rheumatologist. I looked for a good one after I moved for 5 years--finally have a fantastic doc who takes me seriously. Please make sure yours does.
Thank you!
"There are a couple of drugs that I have tried that helped me with dry eyes. One was pilocarpine and the other was cevimeline. Pilocarpine has works better for me, but I don't like the side effects. Cevimeline wasn't as effective for me, but it I tolerated it better. You could talk with your doctor and see if either of these might be useful for you."

"As for drops, there is an OTC drop that you can get from a pharmacy in the U.S. You have to go to the pharmacist because it isn't supposed to be kept out with other OTC eye drops. It's called Fresh Kote. It's a bit spendy though, about $35 for a vial, but I have found that it really helps. My main issue with it is it has preservatives and I don't tolerate them very well. Otherwise, keep trying various gels and drops to see what works for you. I really like GenTeal Tears Gel for Severe Dry Eye. Refresh is good. I've also had really good luck with Systane Ultra."



"Sorry to hear about it. I developed a bit of a closed-eyes routine in the morning that helps me get up and going even if I have no drops or gel. After a while of using it, I no longer need to use the nighttime gel because it was mostly to try to help with my morning eye problems. Definitely don't miss the gel. In the morning as I wake up, with my eyelids closed I found that rolling my eyes very slowly downward (moving my hands along in the air as a guide somehow helps) so I'm looking all the way down helps a lot--in that position I can very slowly open my eyelids with zero risk of injury. Just prior to opening my eyes I try to yawn and do some gentle massaging around my eyes to get some moisture. I also found that the eyedrops work their way in just fine with my eyes closed, but you may already know this."

"If I get any kind of corneal erosion, I find that a no-delays, 1-2 hour eyes-shut-in-dark-room session allows a relatively quick healing process to take place."

"Regarding the mouth, I use Xylimelts at night and during e.g. meetings in the daytime, and I try to stay hydrated to the tune of at least 100 oz. of fluids per day. This has helped quite a bit. As I'm on a very slight caloric deficit as part of weight management, ketosis symptoms also help out because they cause my mouth to water (and with a pleasant sweet taste as well). My friend also has sjogren's and swears by sauerkraut, saying a serving or two a day will keep her mouth from getting dry. I tried it but didn't notice much."

"Generally speaking, I can highly recommend any fitness goals you can start on. I lost a lot of weight and it has really helped me feel more on top of things."

"Also, keeping a log can really help--what works, what to try next, where to get ideas, etc. I'm writing a web page about Sjogren's right now so I can share & also teach myself as much as possible. Again just to feel more on top of things and get a bit more dopamine as a result."

"Personally my biggest issue is constantly being asked about my red face (""wow did you get sunburn? I want to hear about it!""), especially if I had a shower that day. I have to shower and exfoliate at least 3x weekly due to dry/dead skin buildup, but try to do it no more often because it exacerbates my facial redness."

I'm also concerned about other possible follow-ons like the--was it blood cancer / NHL? Can't remember.
Thanks. I'll look into the drug side effects to see how much they're going to affect my Diabetes.
"I appreciate the long response.  It's enlightening to hear about symptoms I haven't considered because this is all so new to me, such as the red face.  It's not something I've experienced yet, but things seem to be deteriorating quickly, so we shall see."

"As far as the corneal abrasion is concerned, what can be done once the damage has already set in?  I'm going month 2 of my eyes being injured."

"Diet and exercise are already a priority to me for the diabetes management.  I'm actually on the opposite end of the spectrum where I'm usually significantly underweight unless I put a lot of effort in to working out and a heavy caloric surplus. With my diabetes, I tend to keep to a low carb/high fat diet. Are there specific foods/food groups that should be avoided with regards to Sjogren's management?"
"> As far as the corneal abrasion is concerned, what can be done once the damage has already set in? I'm going month 2 of my eyes being injured."

"So it sounds like this is an abraded / bumpy portion of your cornea, right? Has anyone taken a look at it with something like a confocal microscope? I had that done by an opthamologist once and received some OK advice (Systane Ultra drops are good; here are some coupons; use drops 4x per day) because the abrasion in question was not extreme. In your case I'm curious to know which layers of the cornea may have been affected; for example, was Bowman's layer somehow pierced or otherwise abraded? Or just: Is there a chance this will heal up over time?"

Do you still get erosions?

> Are there specific foods/food groups that should be avoided with regards to Sjogren's management?

"I've tried various diets like AIP (very hard in my experience), dairy-free, gluten-free (still doing that one) with no results where the Sjogren's was concerned, even though I saw lots of people proclaiming those among others. However my general attitude is that I will try & track almost anything. I am currently on a high-protein, gluten-free diet where I sometimes integrate gluten foods to test my tolerance, but really I haven't noticed any Sjogren's changes related to that."

"If you tend to lose weight, you are probably also losing muscle; in this case I can recommend high protein unless you can't do it for some other reason. Personally I aim for my lean body-mass weight in grams of protein, and I'm usually anywhere from 120-150 grams of protein a day usually. I have read that high protein diets prevent muscle loss during caloric deficits, and with a syndrome that is correlated with fatigue, I'd guess that retaining compensatory muscle would eventually be more and more important."

"With regard to specific symptoms, you might have more luck: If you need tears or moisture now, eating salsa and cutting onions can help, of course--things like that."

I'm scraping the bottom of the bowl here where your question is concerned so I went on some tangents; just in case any of it's useful.

"I am super, totally new to this, so there is no amount of information you can provide at this point that isn't useful. I haven't even really had much of a talk with my doctor about it beyond super basics. If I'm putting too much pressure on you to answer these questions, is there a resource you'd recommend for me to do some reading?"

"re: confocal microscope;  Not to my knowledge.  Up until recently, I've seen a series of eye doctors of all types that just shrugged and sent me to other eye doctors.  It was only through finding a thread on reddit about corneal abrasions that I asked about Sjogren's to start with, so I'm just glad I'll be asking to correct questions at this point. Do I still get erosions?  I don't know.  What signs am I looking for?"

"I ask about diet because it's already so strict and structured due to my diabetes management. If there was something to add or remove, it would be incredibly easy for me to do so. And if it was the opposite of my diabetes diet, I'd just straight up cry. If it's not something that's really applicable, then that's great news.  re: gluten, I intend to get tested for Celiac's on my next quarterly blood test, because why not at this point."
I'm afraid I can't recommend a specific resource to read more; I'd probably recommend academic journals and goverment websites like NIH:

https://medlineplus.gov/sjogrenssyndrome.html

"I have found one or two business schemes dressed up in academic clothing, like a Ph.D. who published a study on Sjogren's that found _maybe_ positive results from diet X, and of course he's actively putting together a website and commercial materials to sell and promote the diet. I have no problems with the commercialization but the study results didn't seem to justify a full diet change _with the expectation_ of good results for a Sjogren's sufferer."

"Please have an eye doc take a look at your corneal scarring / abrasion with a microscope as soon as possible, unless they can give you a good reason why they shouldn't. You'll want to rule out something like [corneal dystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel%E2%80%93Behnke_dystrophy), since based on your symptoms it seems like it could have affected more than the surface layer of your cornea."

"For erosion symptoms, please take a look here:"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_corneal_erosion

"The symptom description includes things that only an eye doctor would be able to see through a medical device. Also, this is just for RCE, which is only one way in which your eyes may be affected by Sjogren's."

"Personally I used to wake up in the morning (or in the middle of the night if e.g. I heard one of my kids crying) and open my eyes, and a bit of my cornea would be torn away by my dry eyelid. I would usually yell out loud because the pain was severe. It started out pretty low on the pain scale at the very beginning though. I thought I had some small irritant in my eye, and it hurt only a little bit at first, but over the course of a couple years it got really bad. I bought an eye patch, tried just about every product out there, etc."

"I haven't had a serious erosion now for over a year, so I'd guess that in most cases this is very much treatable. Rarely does a day go by when I do not put eye drops in my eyes before opening them, and this has been key for me--building up a track record of days over which I've kept my eyes well-lubricated. This seems to make it less likely that a new erosion will make the last one worse."

Good idea on the blood test.

"If I can offer one more thing out of left field: Your individual psychology will have a huge impact on the way you cope with and confront health issues. I personally found it useful to apply what I knew about my personal psychology to my illnesses. For example, research is a huge interest of mine, so I include lots of research in my treatment plan. I write down everything the various doctors say and do my own follow-up research (whether confirming or not) as a way of feeling more confident and lowering stress levels. I'm also a big planner, so I put together a plan, or a theory, and I test it and record my results. Keeping a journal and writing my thoughts about my health is also very helpful. Others may find that group support sessions, even if online, will be very helpful. Still others may get great results from art therapy, counseling, and so on. This is really depressing and anxiety-producing stuff and it's important to develop a personal method that reduces exposure to both depression and anxiety."
"Please forgive my ignorance but what is an MS hug? I'm sorry you are hurting so much, that sounds so awful. I hope you get some relief soon."
Yes. I didn't have a word for it before!

"Its pretty constant for me. Like my ribs want to crack. I've been through so many tests and had doctors looking at me like I'm nuts, I just stopped mentioning it. (I do have a definitive diagnosis for Sjorgrens, but nobody told me about this!)"

Muscle relaxers help me a little bit - I've tried most of the main ones and don't tolerate them well. They make my fatigue way worse. Been trying zanaflex with slightly more success (fyi).

"It sucks that you are hurting, but thank you so much for posting about this."
I’ve had this coupled with muscle weakness before. It was seriously hard to breathe.

"This is a multiple sclerosis specific website, but it can happen in many disorders (including autoimmune)."
"Welcome to our shitty little club, maybe  Widespread pain was my problem, too. I hope whatever it is, a resolution is found, and that you find a decent pain management regimen. I like yoga because my pain is primarily in joints."
"To be fair, you could easily have both fibromyalgia and Sjogren's Syndrome. There is considerable overlap between the two disorders and their symptoms. It is also very common to have both. I'm not saying you do, but it would definitely not be unusual. Even if you don't have both, some of the symptoms you have written about are actually common in either Sjogren's or fibro. For example, a fever with no other symptoms is a common fibro symptom as is the swelling of glands. These are also common symptoms in Sjogren's. This is what makes getting properly diagnosed so difficult."


"I can sympathize with the uncertainty though. I started having symptoms of Sjogren's when I was 17 and symptoms of fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome since I was 21.  I wasn't diagnosed with fibro until I was 34 and I wasn't diagnosed with Sjogren's until I was 36. Some of my doctors have even suggested that I also have chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy, but they have decided that a formal diagnosis is not necessary to treat the issue. Then, on top of all that, I developed an autoimmune form of arthritis when I was 37; I'm now in my mid 40s."

"Even if you're not diagnosed yet, there are some things you can do now to try and relieve some of the symptoms. Warm baths with or without Epsom salt can help with muscle soreness and achy joints. Getting adequate rest is very important. Try to maintain or improve your level of fitness. There are also many over the counter things you can try to relieve dry eyes and dry mouth (gum with xylitol, products like Biotene specifically made to try to relieve dry mouth, eye drops, saline nasal sprays because dry nasal passages is also a thing)."
"thank you <3 I like yoga too. The endorphins from exercise seem to help me a lot. The rheumy put me on a small course of steroids to see if they helped, unfortunately I don't think they did. I am back with him in December so we can review that then."
"Funnily enough after making this post on Friday night I had a horrible flare starting on Saturday morning. And that has made me think that I could have both - because I feel like the flare was triggered from pressure caused by lying in the one position in bed for too long, and I don't think Sjogren's patients have that sensitivity to pressure? I dunno. It's hard to know what causes flares. That is one of the most frustrating things about this pain stuff. Sometimes you don't have to do anything at all and you're in bits."

"Looking back, I think my Sjogren's symptoms began in 2012. I woke up one morning, my tongue and face were very sore and swollen. I couldn't talk or eat anything except soup. The doctor was totally puzzled and sent me on my way with some antibiotics. I don't think they did anything, I think the swelling went down naturally over the next few days. From that point, my face, jaw and tongue would randomly swell and be sore and uncomfortable. there was a time where I could barely open my jaw."

"What were things like for you while you were waiting that long for a diagnosis? Because woah that is a long time. I decided a long time ago that I wasn't going to wait for the doctors to tell me what I had and *then* help myself. I figured out things that helped and I just did them. Baths are amazing. Heatpads are amazing. Rest is a must. Lip balm and eyedrops are a must. Lozenges are a must too. I carry painkillers with me everywhere I go, and Deep Heat. It's very nice to have a space like this where I can talk to others who are going through the same thing. :)"
"Part of the reasons why it took so long in my case is because way back then (1990), neither disorder was very well known. So, I just muddled through the best I could using heat, ice, eye drops, etc. I was basically going from being an insanely physically active person  to barely able to walk for 10 minutes. Every so often the fatigue and/or pain would be too much and I would go back and my docs would try to figure it out and just end up stumped. We would treat the symptoms, of course, but it was frustrating not to know what was going on. When I was finally diagnosed with fibro, I went to a rheumatologist for a second opinion (not that I thought the first doctor was wrong, I just wanted to make sure) and she immediately confirmed the fibro. But then she also wanted to check just to make sure there wasn't anything else going on which is how I was eventually diagnosed with Sjogren's and severe vitamin D deficiency. I have since tried all kinds of other therapies in addition to what I was already doing and either I couldn't tolerate them at all or the benefit just wasn't good enough to compensate for some of the more minor side effects. Physical therapy really helps me, but it is expensive, incredibly time consuming, and most insurance strictly limit how often one can have PT."

My favorite way of dealing with it is distraction: I have lots of hobbies and they are all good for taking my mind off the symptoms as well as maintaining my mental well being.
"I haven't found anything that helps with eyes or mouth. I wasn't a fan of bio.  I just keep artificial tears with me at all times although relief seems short lived, and I ALWAYS have a drink with me. Good luck with the clinical trial. I hope you are accepted! I know what a relief it must be to have a diagnosis."
What is the name of the new drug in clinical trial? I hope it works for you!

"In the meantime, it sounds like you're off to a good start. Here are a few suggestions for things to add:"

#NAME?

- omega 3 via fish oil

#NAME?

"- when artificial tears aren't enough, my favorite eye drops are Soothe XP and Theratears"

#NAME?

#NAME?

#NAME?

#NAME?

- it can take up to 6 months before you notice Plaquenil working. Ask your doctor if a steroid burst would help with your joint pain while you're waiting for the Plaquenil to take effect.

"- if you feel like to Evoxac isn't working for you, ask your doctor if you can try Salagen instead. Also, if you are using generic Evoxac that has numbers on the capsules, I and others have found that to be ineffective. The generic Evoxac made by Ranbaxy that says Evoxac on the side works, though."

"Restasis is expensive. If you're in the US, hopefully your eye doctor told you about the savings program. If not, here's information: https://www.restasis.com/Savings-and-Support/Get-Savings/Enroll"

"Also, hopefully your doctor told you to go to an ophthalmologist for baseline screening before or soon after starting Plaquenil."

"I've posted my [full treatment regimen](http://www.whatyousjo.com/treatments/my-treatment-regimen/) on my website. I use a variety of vitamins and supplements, a strict diet, regular exercise, low-dose Naltrexone, and helminthic therapy in addition to Plaquenil and Restasis."

"I am also interested to know what clinical trial you would be joining. Most clinical trials require positive results for either SS-A or SS-B antibodies, which you don't seem to have. Perhaps this trial is comfortable with just a positive salivary gland biopsy. I hope you are able to participate."
"I can't remember the name of the clinical trial drug, but I'll let y'all know when I find out. My rheumatologist wasn't 100% positive he can get me in without the antibodies, but he's thinking just the biopsy may be enough. We shall see!"
"Couple days late, but wanted to add I hope you're using the preservative free artificial tears. If you're using them every two hours, that's quite a lot and the preservatives can build up/hurt you. A lot of the daily ones come in single use vials you can get."

"Also I've seen some mouth sprays at CVS for dry mouth. It doesn't help for long, but it's nice for a bit. I keep one in my purse."
"I've tried pretty much everything you've mention so try adding these things - Borage oil supplement with GLA, vit B12 every day even if you're not deficient, and Avenova eye scrub. I've done Restasis, Evoxac, etc and these three methods are the only ones that have given me noticeable relief and not all doctors know about them. It took me three different specialists to figure out the borage oil and b12. good luck"
"Thank you! My MD didn't tell me about the restasis savings thing- you just saved me 20 bucks last night! I'm not sure what the name of the drug is but I'll update y'all when I find out. My Rheumy is hopeful that just a salivary gland biopsy will be enough, but he mentioned that I might not qualify due to lack of antibodies."
Thanks for posting the link- very helpful!

My Rheumy is hopeful that the salivary gland biopsy will be enough but he let me know that there is a possibility I'll be excluded for lack of blood work evidence. We'll see!
"I have that same issue and it lasted for weeks at a time. I was given steroid cream but did nothing for me., got some novacaine (sp?) Then my obgyn told me to start using coconut oil for intercourse and just as therapy. I started doing that and i dont have thay problem anymore! I'm also on plaquenil, BTW."
"It seems like the Coconut Oil is the best direction for you to go as far as treating this symptom, judging from others' responses.  From my experience with the academic literature concerning Plaquenil, the variability in treatment and side effects is quite large.  It seems like pretty consistently it will reduce some symptoms and worsen others so it could very easily just be a symptom of your pSS that wasn't bad enough to notice before which has been exacerbated.  That said, if you're not also noticing a concurrent increase in dryness elsewhere that's somewhat less likely."

You might want to see a Urogeinocologist who specialize with that kind of stuff.

"I've been struggling with itchiness and burning for years. It finally dawned on me it could be dryness, so I started applying coconut oil after every shower."

Holy crap. I didn't even realize how much of a burden it was to deal with it! It totally feels like a major weight was lifted from me.
"I'm going to try coconut oil, thanks!"
"Hmm good points all around. Unfortunately my insurance is a pain in the ass (I require a PCP referral for all specialists) and my PCP is extremely skeptical of all the referral requests I'm sending her way (I'm trying to go to a ophthalmologist and a gastroenterologist). She's been skeptical from the start and gave me a very hard time about seeing a rheumatologist and an orthopedist in the first place. I've had to do all the research myself and set a hardline with her. Guess I need  to go back and talk again. She thinks I'm a hypochondriac, will bounce back, I'm only 26, etc."
"Oh my god. Pardon my french but your endo is a DICK. You should not have to ""live with it"". I'm personally trying to find a new OBGYN that is familiar with autoimmune diseases because my MD was not helpful either- she just said try KY. I'm allergic to glycerin soooo no thanks!"

"I started taking Exovac for dry mouth recently and a nice side effect was that it has really seemed to help a lot with vaginal dryness and itching. I still start feeling itchy and dry before my period still but not as dramatically as before. Another thing that has helped is oatmeal baths (I use my ninja blender to chop up oats into a course powder so they ""infuse"" with the water more easily. I put them in a mesh bag meant for making almond milk so they don't make a huge mess in the bath tub) and then I apply coconut oil when I get out of the bath and any time it feels too itchy to handle. After my period it seems to go away on it's own for the most part but I still use some coconut oil to help everything calm down."

"My rheumatologist said it's completely normal to flare really bad before and during our periods- though they don't know how or why, SS and other autoimmune diseases are definitely linked to hormones. So as if horrible cramps and bleeding out of my nether regions wasn't bad enough, now I get crazy itchy vag and horrendous joint pain to go with it! Okay, end rant but you get the idea."

"Keep me updated if you find anything else that helps, I hope you feel better soon. :("
"Just make sure it's organic and extra virgin. Hope you feel better soon... Of all my symptoms, that has been one of the worst. *hugs*"
"Yes unfortunately many people with AI diseases are treated as hypochondriacs :(  It's an unfortunate side effect of having a systemic illness.  As odd as it may strike some people, Planned Parenthood is generally a good place to go for Women's Health without all the complications of setting up a new PCP who might also be able to refer you in a way that is satisfactory to  your insurance.  Might be a stretch but worth looking into I think."
"Are you asked to change PCP's?  Getting an internist instead of a GP was so helpful for me.  I'm getting ready to change because of new insurance placing me with a witch.  But whoever it is, must be internist. Seem to have less issues with hypochondria labels and more help getting to specialists I need."
"I live in Texas so PP is a sad, sad, underfunded place :( Such a shame. I'm asking around for a new PCP at this time. I saw your other post with research articles about PSS- do you have any specific to gynecological manifestations of the disease that I could show my PCP or rheumy?"
"Yeah, of course!  The articles aren't super detailed...they basically conclude ""the primary gynecological manifestation of SS is vaginal dryness because duh, what part of attack the moisture producing mucus membranes don't you get?"""

Here's a [classic paper](http://stevenlehrer.com/images/sjogren.pdf) available online which may also give you some piece of mind that there was no relationship found between SS and miscarriages or infertility.

"Most of the books on SS also talk about it in some depth.  Unfortunately, a fair number of studies have shown that while complaints of vaginal dryness and Dyspareunia (dryness syndrome) were higher in pSS patients compared to controls but the gynecological exams didn't show marked differences beyond normal controls."

Here are two important caveats to that last statement:

"1. Those studies are STUPIDLY underpowered, in other words, they do not have large enough sample sizes to reliably and consistently detect effects that may actually exist."

"2. This wasn't because the rates weren't high in SS patients, its because they WERE high in normal healthy women.  That is to say, as a woman, regardless of your other health conditions, it is completely within the realm of expectation (In one sample 61% of all participants, regardless of diagnosis, reported active problems with vaginal dryness).  If you say you're having vaginal dryness you shouldn't have to get approval from your PCP to validate it for you to see a specialist."

"[This book chapter section](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-85729-947-5_24#page-1) sums it up pretty nicely.   (for this link, click the ""look inside"" button on the right)"

"Hmm, this is tough to answer. For demographics' sake, I'm 31, female, diagnosed at 24, so the way Sjogren's affects my body will likely be different from yours. Most days I feel pretty ok and normalish, it's only when it's flaring that I ever feel really terrible. It's funny that you mention that you didn't really notice your dry eyes and mouth until being diagnosed- I didn't either. It never occurred to me that it wasn't normal, I didn't even use eye drops until my ophthalmologist gave me some systane drops and my eyes were properly lubricated for the first time in many years. I just thought everyone was like I was. Over time it has gotten worse overall but still isn't terrible- I used to wear contacts every day but can't anymore (still can every once in a while, but I do need to keep drops handy) and unless I'm in a flare, dry eyes only disturb me during the night when I'm trying to sleep. The same can be said for the other symptoms- fatigue, joint pain, etc- when I am flaring it's pretty bad, and strange joint pain is usually the first clue for me that flare is coming on, but for the most part I think I feel ok otherwise.  I do have a lot of dryness and pain in my sinuses that I haven't been able to manage very well no matter what I try.  If you have allergies you may want to ask your rheumatologist about that. My allergist seemed to be pretty ill-equipped to deal with sjogrens."


"I think that attitude and lifestyle will have a big effect on how you manage sjogren's. I started having a lot less joint pain and fatigue once I started exercising regularly, so if you're active already that's probably helping you.  Also, having a positive attitude about it on the days when you do feel terrible will help you crawl out from under it and carry on. I used to feel a lot worse when I felt sjogren's symptoms and sorry for myself at the same time."

"As for Plaquenil, I took it for a few months when I was first diagnosed but didn't really notice any changes, other than that my hair starting growing out as a different color (I know that sounds crazy but it's a real possible side effect).  I have known other people who went on it and it helped them a lot. Don't know about prednisone, but I was prescribed a pack of prednisolone for some sinus problems I was having, and let me tell you I hadn't felt that good in years as I did when I was taking it. It was only for 5 days or something like that, but man, I felt like a new person. I had energy, I wasn't in any pain, I wore contacts all day without needing drops. I blew my nose and could actually blow stuff out of it and it was such a relief that I honestly got emotional cried tears of joy. So if they think the prednisone will help, I say give it a try."

Best of luck to you! I hope you and your doctor are able to figure out a care plan that works for you.
"You mentioned you're prepping for your follow up appointment with your rheum, so wanted to pass along this blog post on preparing for an appointment: http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/bid/213972/Sjogren-s-and-Preparing-for-a-New-Doctor-Visit"
"I'm 28F with primary Sjogren's, diagnosed one year ago. I never noticed my symptoms of dry eyes and mouth until I learned what Sjogrens is, and I've heard that before. The symptoms I DID notice were things like a mental fog, chronic fatigue, and holy-shit-are-you-serious-right-now joint pain. I was 25 when I started seeking answers because of the pain in my knees, hips and back - I limped worse than my 65 year old mom. I've never met anyone else IRL with Sjogrens, and I don't see chronic joint pain mentioned here too often, but it's awful and constant. Yay."

"On the plus side, prednisone was a game changer for me. It helped a ton with the joint pain and foggy feeling."
"I would say avoid steroid use long term unless it's absolutely necessary. The side effects run the gamut from mildly annoying to terrible.  HCQ has helped me greatly, but I feel like you really have to stick with it. It wasn't until about 4.5 months of taking it I felt a difference. My nerve pain went from debilitating to barely there, and it actually gave me some tears/spit back. The effect on fatigue has been negligible but oh well, it's waaaaaay better than it was."
"Hello there, I'm a friend of pSS and I have quite a deep knowledge of the academic literature on the disease, especially when it comes to Plaquenil.  Generally speaking, Plaquenil is by far the most common treatment and is most consistently helpful."

"That being said, here is my semi-professional opinion (as a neuroscience researcher): Plauqenil is a very unpredictable drug.  The mechanism of action in how it helps people with various AI diseases is not well understood at all and the side effects list is long.  In many cases Plaquenil will decrease some symptoms and increase others.  Most consistently it is pretty good at relieving inflamation based symptoms as well as fatigue.  If your symptoms aren't invasive and do not disrupt your everyday life much I would suggest that you delay a drug therapy for as long as possible.  There is no such thing as a drug without side effects (whether you can detect them directly or not) and no such thing as a drug that your body won't adapt to (gaining tolerance is like a reverse balancing act), therefore delaying such interventions is almost always in your best interest if possible."

"If you are going to try a drug-based intervention, i would recommend you talk with your doctor about a simple NSAID regimen to help with the inflammation.  Your central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, the ""brain fog"", are not well understood and are completely underresearched but I've read all the work on it and I'm relatively confident that they are, at minimum, inflammation based and can be helped with basic low dose NSAIDs, like advil."

Hope this helps.
Check out this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/32wdwc/some_scientific_articles_on_ss_and_chronic_illness/) I did last year which has some good scientific resources.
Thank for for the thoughtful response. All I can hear is useful to me and much appreciated.
"Super helpful, thank you for taking the time. Lots of googling here and had not found that."

"Thanks. I've been reticent to consider the prednisone due to side effects, but maybe t will help me see what I've become accustomed to versus how I should be feeling. Much appreciated."
Thank you. The HCQ feedback has been mixed so this is very useful.
"Thank you. Secondary opinion in process (treatment, not diagnosis) at well regarded Boston hospital, so timing is perfect. Thank you."
"Definitely! I don't take meds all the time, generally only during a flair, which annoys my rheum, but works best for me because of the side effects."

Other non-medicinal things: stay out of the sun when possible and wear a wide brimmed hat when you can't avoid it. I realized the worst of the pain happened when I was out in the sun a lot the day before.

"As hard and tragic as it may seem, give up coffee. I'm down to one cup a day and the loss of caffeine helped too. Similarly, quit smoking if you're a smoker and the dry mouth improves dramatically."

Not eating large meals but eating small amounts every few hours helped me too. I didn't feel as tired and beat down when I switched to that schedule.

"And finally, if you wear glasses, get the screen glare coating. It made a huge difference in my work performance! My eyes are less gritty feely and don't strain as much."
LifeExtension brand Super Bio-Curcumin has really helped me with joint pain - 400 mg in the morning and again in the evening.  You might want to give it a try.

edited to correct brand name
Hugs I got diagnosed last year. It way more than just dry mouth. It sucks. I wake up with aches everywhere and my hands and feet always hurt. :( stay strong. You seem to have a lot going on
"I've lost my my vision in 1 eye, I've been on chemo, knee surgeries,  GI issues, the list goes on.  I see so many specialist.  It's so overwhelming."
"It's not a cure, but have you tried the autoimmune paleo diet? It really helps reduce the severity of my symptoms, and it might help you too."
helminthic therapy. read about it. works wonders. and of course paleo diet. if you're not paleo by now you must be a zombie. I couldnt function on a normal diet.
"I know I'm late on the uptake here but I totally get it. I had RA from when I was about 9~16 when i hit puberty and the RA disappeared, but left me with sjogrens. trying to cope with adult life when you're a young person with an AI issue is impossible, no one understands and everyone expects you to act like everyone else your age. I'm 23 now but feel 83 most days. feel your pain, pm me if you ever need to talk :)"
"I started using LifeExtensions Super Bio-Curcumin last month and it has been great for alleviating aches in my hands, feet and elbows. I take 400 mg capsule in the morning and another in the evening. Just reordered from luckyvitamin.com. I don't work for LifeExtensions or luckyvitamin."
"I don't even think ""alot"" covers it lol, but thank you"
"Sorry to hear you've been experiencing so many medical issues. Sjogren's is definitely more than just dryness, and the dryness issues can cause a lot of other problems in the body (especially the digestive system due to low saliva). I recently read somewhere that depression may be associated with inflammation which explains why depression is common in people with AI problems. I hope things get better for you soon."
Thank you
Male with SS is pretty unusual to begin with. 1 in 10.  So we're a pretty small group.

You are probably okay as long as the chronic fatigue isn't wiping you out yet.  There's a good chance that will come.

"Also, plaquenil is known to cause retinal toxicity.  Keep an eye on your eyes, especially since you've already had eye problems."

"Jury is out on effectiveness of plaquenil.  (I've been on it 2 years and hard to say if it's helped) that said, look into LDN Low Dose Naltrexone if you start experiencing brain fog or fatigue.  It is like a miracle drug for some people, myself included."
"If/When the fatigue hits you, you can try getting a diagnosis of Shift-Work disorder so they'll give you Nuvigil/Provigil. If your indigestion is something you can suck up, you might ride that out, but if it develops into a genuine motility issue, that's curtains for active duty. Fortunately that's rare. Likewise your vision problems may stabilize for a long time, if they don't then that's bad. Generally the eye problems hit older people much harder, so it's more likely to be after 50 or so that that gets worse than it is."

"Since you have joint pain, it is quite likely you have a co-morbidity, as autoimmune diseases are anecdotally said to travel in threes; We see a lot of Ankylosing Spondylitis, Arthritis, and Cryoglobulinemia along with a Sjogren's diagnosis...especially in our male patients. Neurological issues also can appear, but tend to happen to women more."

"You should know that if you are already autoimmune compromised this greatly increases your risks regarding trauma; a bad injury often triggers a new set of symptoms and sometimes a new diagnosis. You'll also be at risk for opportunistic later infections, you may not respond as well to antibiotics and if you start a course of steroids you will likely have trouble tapering off of them."

"The other general thing is that men are far less likely to get AI diagnoses, but those that do often get the diseases with much stronger symptoms."

"You should probably be following up with an Ophthalmologist quarterly for a couple years, especially if you get on Plaquenil. If you're overseas the good news is a lot of drugs that are super expensive or discontinued in the US are cheap and readily available in Europe/South America/Canada, such as Oramoist(dry mouth) and Voltaren(Topical anti-inflammatory)."
"1 in 10? Damn, I didn't realise it was that rare. I'm 24 and have had it for the past few years. My Gran, who also has Sjogrens and was the reason I got tested, said a small percentage of folk with Sjogrens were male but I didn't think it was as low as 10%."
"Looking back at the past six months or so, now knowing that I have Sjogren's, I have become noticeably more tired to the point where I feel completely spent by the end of the work day and very rarely feel up for working out."

"I figured this was just due to my work schedule as I wake up around 5:15 a.m. every day. I just don't know how much of that is attributable to Sjogrens, how much is due to my work schedule and how much is me just being a pansy."

"Can you explain your fatigue and how it came on after you developed SS? Also, what do you mean by brain fog?"

"I'll be going to see my ophthalmologist on a regular basis now that I've been diagnosed. The good news was the last time I went, which was about a month ago, my eyes looked healthy with no more hemorrhages. If you start to develop retinal toxicity, will you be able to tell at all?"
"There are tests they can do to check for retinal toxicity at your regular eye check ups. One involves taking a photo of the inside of your eye which is done in just a few minutes unless you're like me and your eyes don't dilate (even with dilation drops). My rheumatologist and eye doctor require those tests at least once a year, but your doctors may require it more or less often. It is rare to develop retinal toxicity, but it is important to be aware of it. There are symptoms of toxicity, but you might not notice them until it is more severe. My eye doctor told me what the signs and symptoms were just in case I noticed them, but the annual checks would be better at catching it early."


"Brain fog is common with many chronic disorders that have chronic fatigue and chronic pain as well as some mental health disorders. Ever been so tired you just can't think straight? It's kind of like that, just worse. Multitasking is difficult, doing math is difficult, you may have problems recalling names, events, or words. You may forget things. But, it is important to know, that it isn't progressive. It isn't a disease like Alzheimer's. It is basically your brain being too overwhelmed to think straight because of chronic pain and chronic fatigue. Not everyone experiences it and even if you do, it will usually wax and wane: it will be worse when your other symptoms are flaring up and will diminish as other symptoms lessen."


"Try to continue working out, but maybe choose more of a moderate workout - walking instead of running, lighter weights/fewer reps instead of working to failure. The fatigue makes it very difficult to work out, but not working out can be even worse. It gets tricky. In my case, I have to make sure I have extra rest time set aside because of the extra fatigue I will develop from working out. I have also found out that working out for a half hour is doable for me, but working out longer than that is not."
"Yeah, your eye doc can detect retinal toxicity.  Get an eye check once a year, tell them you are on plaquenil and rake note of any changes in vision. Retinal toxicity is pretty rare, but something to be aware of."

"Behind dry eyes and dry mouth, fatigue is the most reported symptom. Your body gets worn out attacking itself all day!  Stress and lack of sleep make things worse."

Brain fog is another common symptom.  Have you ever had allergies or a cold to where you can't think straight?  It's basically like that.  You just feel dumb at times and can't come up with answers that are easy for you at other times.

"Not sure if you are on Facebook,  but there are a number of closed groups you can join.  Lots of good info.  There's even a men with Sjogrens group, though it only has a handful of folks."

"It's a weird disease that affects everyone a bit differently.  What's interesting to me is how after I was diagnosed, all the weird symptoms I had made sense... (Raynauds, numb tongue, tingling neuropathy, etc...)"

Thanks for the tips.

"As a writer by trade, this brain fog sounds pretty crummy. There have been quite a few times over the past several years where I have difficulty recalling words to use in my stories. Most of the time I know the word I want to use, but my brain, for whatever reason, just can't pinpoint what it is. I've always chalked this up to writer's block, but it's good to know that it could be stemming from SS."

"I'm still hesitant on blaming everything that's been happening to me to this disease, though. I'm still learning about it, and a lot of the health-related issues I've had now begin to make a lot more sense. I'm just worried that reading too much into every other person's symptoms will increase my chances of falling into a ""group think"" mentality where I start attributing those symptoms to myself, if that makes any sense."

"For instance, like I said before, I get tired so easy nowadays. I don't remember being that way several years ago, but by the time I'm halfway through my work day, I feel rundown, and if I'm on my feet for awhile, my legs and knees get really sore and achy. By the time I get home at the end of the day, I'm usually exhausted to the point where I have to force myself to do homework with the kids, let alone all the other responsibilities I have at home."

"There are days where I wake up, and my whole body feels sore, like I just had an intense workout the day before, but I didn't really do anything all that strenuous. I'm in pretty good shape and was working out nearly every day up until a couple months ago, when it became increasingly hard to finish a workout and muster the energy to get in the gym. I used to spend at least an hour in the gym working out, but then, after 30 minutes or so, I'd feel spent and just couldn't push myself any farther."

"Sjogren's seems like a very odd disease and one that effects a lot of people differently. It's been difficult for me to accept that this is from Sjogren's. Being that I've been in the military for so long and how I was raised, I feel the urge to suck it up and keep pushing myself harder. I'm just not sure if that's the smart move anymore."
"I have always been a ""suck it up and deal with it"" kind of overachiever so developing several disorders that cause chronic pain and fatigue was a bit of a kick in the teeth. There are a lot of good tips out there for dealing with a lot of the issues of Sjogren's. One of the hardest things for me to get used to was not overdoing it on a good day. Taking it easy on a bad day is, well easy. But sometimes the symptoms won't flare up for a day or two after I have done too much or pushed myself too hard. It took me a long time to realize that I don't always have immediate feedback to tell me I'm doing too much. I started using an app called My Pain Diary and started keeping track of the symptoms.  I can track meds, sleep, activities, weather, and create reports for my doctor. I can even track more than one condition. The app allowed me to find out exactly what things make my symptoms worse/better and has really helped me better manage my health problems. I am fond of My Pain Diary, but there are other apps out there that do similar tasks. Just find one that suits your needs. I don't use it now as much, but for about 6 months I did and it made a significant difference in helping me to understand the cause and effect of my actions on my symptoms."
"You could always try a lower dose, but if you have a reaction that's *not* GI that is really, really rare."

It stays in your system for 4-6 weeks(less if you've only been on it <2months.)
"I researched the drug a lot lately because I started taking it about 4 months ago. Most of the symptoms you describe never came up. I just pulled out the leaflet from my hydroxy pack, and the only things that kind of match are ""muscle weakness, cramps, stiffness or spasms or changes in sensitisation after long term use"" and ""tired, faint dizzy and pale could be symptoms of something called anaemia - frequency unknown."" Correlation doesn't equal causation, but if all that stopped once you stopped the hydroxy, then who knows."

"I will say when I first got diagnosed with SS, and even still, all the symptoms came at different stages, I didn't just get everything all at once. So the fatigue and the pains could be from the SS itself. Peripheral neuropathy is super common (and super shitty) with SS. Mostly it happens in the limbs, but it can happen anywhere."

"I would say maybe try the hydroxy again at a lower dose, and bear in mind you have to keep at it for at least 3 months. I'm just at the point where it's started to work for me and it makes a world of difference. Then again I am an internet stranger and not a doctor and you probably shouldn't listen to anything I say."

Good luck


"I've done a good deal of research into Plaquenil, read all of the major clinical trial write-ups and such.  As someone else suggested, your symptoms almost sounds more like typical SS symptoms then side effects of Plaquenil.  That being said, the side-effects documented have been wide-spread and some people are just intolerant to it.  THAT being said, you don't want to jump to conclusions about the effect of the Plaquenil, it could be a number of other things (beware of false correlations!) and Plaquenil is by far the most effective drug for SS that has been widely studied.  It also tends to regularly take 3 months or more to have a noticeable improvement effect."

"Do you know if you have neurological complications?  Do you have ""brain fog""?  Or extreme headaches/migraines from dehydration?  Plaquenil tends to react a little worse with those complications."

"What would you say is your worst/most concerning symptom(s)?  There are some alternatives that are in varying stages of testing.  Some are better at treating certain symptoms than others.  I can probably point you in a direction for more research/asking you rheumy/doctor about.  Also, if you're open to it, you should look into local drug trials for SS as that gets you potentially helpful medication for free."
I haven't taken that as my doctor put me on Gababentin.... not sure if that would help you but it's worth a shot asking about it?
I can't write much because I'm on my phone but ill add more later...I completely understand. The pain I get in my joints when I am over tired is unparalleled. I can't even open my toothpaste or wash my hands or get out of bed. Hang in there and feel free to PM me until I can get to a comp.
"First *hugs*. Second, you need to find a way to be honest to the people around you. I know it's tough, it sucks and it isn't fair, but you're going to end up alienating people who would otherwise help you. I think one of the biggest misconceptions about SS is it's just dry eyes or whatever. Some people are fortunate enough to only deal with some of the smaller symptoms. The rest of us, not so much."

"How are you honest to your friends? First you need to be honest with yourself. Your body is different than it used to be and changing. It can be changing for the better or worse, but you need to realize what you used to be able to do may not be the same anymore and get a realistic idea of what you can do. Could you go every other round for three or four rounds and extend how many bouts you can participate in? Do you need to conserve your energy a day or two before to help with your energy levels? Once you figure that out go in knowing that and share you limits. ""I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and I'm trying to learn how to manage my fatigue and pain so I'm only going to ___."" Try to set that line when you can still enjoy people when you're done."

Have you ever been on prednisone before?
"Welcome to our little group.  I am sorry you have to join it.  Soft hugs.  You will get the dry eyes/dry mouth a lot.  That is when people have even heard of it.  It is so much more.  For me, I have a multitude of AI issues plus neck damage so I don't even try to identify which symptom goes with which disease.  One thing I do is note any new ones.  If they continue, I research (through co-sufferers a lot) to see if it needs mentioning to my doctor."

The FB page Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation includes a great bunch of people living with SS.  I have learned more there than any doctor or book. It is also a great place to rant without feeling guilty.

Treat yourself as you would a sick friend.  Do what you can but don't feel bad when you can't do anymore.  Rest when able.  Drink lots of fluids.
"I haven't had it that bad yet, but I couldn't use my one hand at all to drive about 3 minutes yesterday, and that freaked me out."

"I feel mostly scared because I don't know if this is going to get better (Plaquenil will take effect in 3 months) or if it's just going to get steadily worse throughout my life. Yesterday, there were veteran fencers (40+, oldest in 70s) and they seemed limited, but moving without pain. I guess I feel that when I get to that age, I'm not going to be able to do what they're doing."

"My other anxiety is that since I've gotten diagnosis, I've been much better at verbally telling friends, who now know, when I'm in pain. Before, I mostly kept it to myself because I didn't know what was going on and would 'power through' the situation. Verbally telling them helps me stop what I'm doing, but I've heard one or two comments about 'how I seem to be in pain' a lot. I feel guilty from that because I don't want to complain, I don't want to be a downer, and I know that the situation isn't as bad as it could be."
"I have told most of my friends by writing a brief note on Facebook explaining Sjogren's and saying how it has and will impact my life, mostly because I'd like to get involved with awareness and autoimmune disease research. More important friends already knew I was struggling and going through some type of diagnoses process, and my fencing clubs are also aware because I have let my coaches know that I just can't do everything every time they ask. My family knows, and I've talked a bit with my cousin who has some different chronic pain problems which has helped a lot."

"I think I don't know how to talk about it with people who notice but I've only just met, which is what had happened yesterday. Saying 'Sjogren's' is not nearly as recognizable as saying other autoimmune diseases, so I was struggling with how to do it. I did end up telling that particular coach that I had 'joint issues' later in the day when he accused me of looking disgusted, although I was in pain, but then later he made some dismissive comment about how 'it must just be climate change.' Thank you so much for that line (""I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and I'm trying to learn how to manage my fatigue and pain so I'm only going to ___."") because I think it sums up how I'm feeling and is a concise, non-attention bringing way to deal with it."

"I'm having trouble setting limits on what I should do because some days, everything is fine! And that's awesome. Other days, I wake up feeling bad and slow and I know it's just not going to work. Then yesterday, I was 'aware' of my joints when I woke up, bu they didn't hurt until after I attempted to do things."

"I haven't been on prednisone, and from the sounds of it it isn't a daily medication, but reserved for single-use on days that are 'really bad'. Looks like it has some pretty nasty side effects if taken regularly..."
I'm glad that phrase is helpful. :)

The sometimes wild swings in day-to-day energy levels and pain is the most frustrating aspect of SS for me.  Sometimes I think it makes people take it less seriously too because they can't understand how I can be so sick one day and almost normal a day or two later.

I think as you get used to having SS you'll probably be able to do a self-assessment each morning and get an idea of what you'll be able to do. Journaling might help figure that out if it's a problem.

Prednisone is great short term.  It's a very nasty medicine long term.

"As far as the global warming comment, which made me laugh, people react in all sorts of really weird ways. Sometimes they're pretty unbelievable."
"Again, thank you for all of the advice & listening."

"A few days later, I have prednisone, but I'm wary to use it although my wrists/fingers still are very tender because I know it can be awful."

> Sometimes I think it makes people take it less seriously too because they can't understand how I can be so sick one day and almost normal a day or two later.

"A friend jokingly called it Schroedinger's syndrome based on how Sjogren's is pronounced, but I think that works as a metaphor too: sick or not sick in the box, outside looks the same!"
"Well, diagnosis isn't completely official yet, I see the rheumatologist for the first time in a week or so, but main doctor has already done blood tests and thinks it Sjogren's."

"Currently kind of in a bad mood because this seems to have been affecting my joints and I can't fence properly when they're inflamed. I'm a very restless person and do not like being unable to participate. Fatigue also sucks in that area since sometimes I just feel really, really slow. These are the reasons I originally went to the doctor, although the dry mouth/eyes are also true for me! Just never thought of that as a problem."

"Salivary pain I can relate. The glands in the back of your mouth, under the ears, tend to painfully swell for me. Especially if I'm eating something sour- no more ShockTarts, goodbye childhood candy favorites!"
"Welcome! I haven't had the same issues with the salivary glands, but the fatigue is seriously kicking my butt.  I hadn't had an issue with depression, but I've had a couple of hard knocks with SS and I'm just not bouncing back like I had before. No it isn't very big, but there are more resources on the sidebar to talk to more people."
I find fatigue and depression hard to judge as I also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and psoriasis. But for ages I had pain in my salvia glands that I had no idea what it was till I was diagnosed with Sjögren's! It affects my jaw I agree and can be so painful! When my rheumatologist first saw me he was shocked at just how swollen they were!
"I just discovered it too!  I'm a 26/f.  My salivary gland issues have caused many cavities so I now use special toothpaste and have to be really careful.  I suffer from fatigue (but I have fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and depression/anxiety which the Fibro is associated with.  I take effexor for it, and it helps however once in a while I will have a very anxious day where I feel like the whole world is crashing down upon me.  Nice talking to you all :)"
I've found the sicker I get the more restless I've become. I've taken to knitting or crocheting almost constantly to help.
"Yeah I hate that feeling of my body going so slow.. and that's the same part of my face that swells up. Does it ever get so bad that you can't eat for several hours? I think that only happens to me when I'm not drinking enough water. It seems like my thirst mechanism doesn't work as well as other peoples, I have to constantly remind myself to drink. And ooh just thinking of shocktarts hurts xD imagine eating those and then laughing or smiling really big, oh the pain!!"
Auto immune illnesses are unpredictable and can affect people very differently. If you're afraid it's a false positive I suggest you get a new test done. It can happen though I don't believe it's often.

"Tbh I think you're lucky to get diagnosed early. This mean you stand a better chance at protecting your eyes and teeth. With less saliva comes more bacteria so you need to take much more care than other people to avoid cavities and oral infections. The same goes for the eyes. If your eyes get too dry it can also damage your sight and give a lot pain. Remember that stress can make autoimmune illnesses worse, so take good care of yourself."
"I didn't even know what Sjögren's was and didn't think I had dry eyes or dry mouth, but a new rheumy said I looked like I had it when she looked at me. Had the blood tests then a lip biopsy, all came back positive. I've felt loads better since starting meds. And now I notice all the symptoms I didn't realize were symptoms."
"Not Sjorgren's, but Celiac's. I was having an EGD (front scope) done for acid reflux issues from scleroderma."


"They got down deep enough that the doctor said, ""Hey, that's not right. Let's get us a biopsy and make him do some serology."" Lo and behold, another autoimmune to add to my collection."


Best advice I can really give is this:
Get these things. They can be the saviors of your fingers. The 6 hour version are really good for closer to 9 and the 12 hour close to 16. [https://www.amazon.com/Zippo-Hand-Warmer-6-Hour-Chrome/dp/B013HLGULG](https://www.amazon.com/Zippo-Hand-Warmer-6-Hour-Chrome/dp/B013HLGULG)
"Thanks for the input.  I'm a little scared and hoping its a misdiagnosis/lab error.  After reading through some threads on here, I'm figuring out that its not too pleasant to deal with.  I agree with you that an early diagnosis might turn out to be beneficial."
"Interesting.  What meds did they put you on?  Do you have any other auto immune disorders?  As I mentioned, I have raynaud's and pernio (or chilblains).  But, so far, neither of those have been to life altering."
"Not all of us get bad symptoms and there are a disproportionate amount of horror stories on the internet. Social medias and blogs are full of bad cases while none writes about the boring ones where people live relatively normal lives.  There's no need to assume the worst. If you can, try to see the diagnosis as a reminder to take care of and pamper your mind and body."
"If anything just take this as a sign to take care of yourself. Regardless of if you have it or not. Drink lots of water (like 2x as much as you think you need) and sleep well, and care for your body. Light Exercise, avoid stress, eat well, and visit your doctor often."

"A lot of my symptoms were exacerbated by living in an unclean home with mold. I didn't know about it at the time. But when I moved I found a significant drop in my symptoms, but I know now to avoid poor air quality and mold/bacteria that could set me off more."
Raynauds is also a symptom of Sjogrens
Yeah I'm on plaquenil. I have hashimoto's as well. I didn't realize how bad I felt until I got on my meds for both.
"Amen to that. If you read all the posts you’ll either think there’s nothing wrong with you, or else that you’re on your last legs. Symptoms vary widely"
Thx for this. :)
"Did you see any signs of mold in your previous house? I’m always looking for it, but don’t see any signs other than some shower ick that gets on the grout from time to time. When I first got really sick with AI problems, when I was much younger, my bedroom was in my parent’s basement and one year it flooded. We cleaned it all up, solved the flooding issue, and there was no visible mold down there...but it’s always made me wonder if there was some hidden mold issue."
I drink a lot. :)  That's why I thought *maybe* I had the dry mouth symptom?  Eyes a little itchy but nothing bad.
"Sometimes the dryness symptoms come years after other symptoms. I looked through your post history, and it looks like you’re in your 50s? Honestly, you may never develop bad Sjogren’s, or it may only start to really effect you in your 70s or 80s. I started getting neurological symptoms of Sjogren’s as a teenager, then they went away, and at almost 40 am now getting the dryness symptoms. There are several people on my Facebook group who were diagnosed via blood work, and did not start showing symptoms until 20 years or so later. You’re very lucky!! Just keep taking care of yourself, go to your rheumatologist when he wants to see you, and don’t worry about it. You don’t need to take medication if you’re not even having symptoms."
"Right now, they seem most concerned about my liver function and if I've got something auto immune going on there.  I appreciate everyone's input today.  I have a feeling I may actually have it and its just part of the auto immune puzzle that I've got going on."
Can you tell me what neurological symptoms you had and how they went away? Did you take medication?
"I’ve never heard of someone having a false positive ssa. A lot of people get false negative, and you could end up testing negative for the ssa at some point too...but I think the fact that it was there means you probably have Sjögren’s? It can be a very slow developing disease, and you may never really experience the effects from it."
"I had drop foot for a couple months, some tingling and numbness in hands and feet that only lasted a week, fatigue, headaches, low back ache, swollen parotid. It went away for a year, and then I started waking up in the middle of the night unable to use one of my thighs, like they were paralyzed, but then the strength would come back after a few minutes. I was getting nerve entrapment in my hips, I’m guessing nerve swelling. I went to an acupuncturist (had been to three neurologists who were of no help) who did a few treatments on me and told me to stop eating wheat. He also told me I had bad circulation and needed to exercise more. I stopped eating wheat, but also stopped eating fast food, drinking alcohol, eating any sweets or sugar, and started doing yoga and walking everyday. Didn’t have any symptoms for 15 years after that other than raynauds, and some minor dry mouth and eyes. No, never took medication. They didn’t even know it was autoimmune. They tested me for MS, and at the time just didn’t know much about AI. I’m sure with my symptoms today, I’d have been sent to a rheumatologist, but I was just sent to neurologists."
Thanks for the reply! I’m planning on starting a new diet soon so it’s good to know it can help!
It means you do not appear to have circulating SS-A or SS-B antibodies that are typically associated with Sjogren's.  The implications of that depend on any other markers/symptoms you have.
Deep breaths!

"While I'm sure it feels like everything in your world is on fire right now between toddler, PhD program, and all those symptoms, stress is going to make your symptoms worse in my experience."

"The good news: now that you have these positive test results, it may help your medical care team come up with a treatment plan. That's a great thing. Sjogrens is still not completely understood, but it could be the root of a lot of your symptoms....and there are medications on the market which can drastically reduce how those symptoms affect your life."

"Question: have you been taking a lot of NSAIDs (like naproxen or ibuprofen) lately? They can cause the acid reflux/problems with the esophagus if you've taken them too often. I only know this because before I was diagnosed, my major presenting symptom was arthritis. For six months that had me on naproxen twice a day and that wrecked hell on my esophagus and stomach."

I know you must be busy- but try to put some time aside before Monday to do something relaxing for you. You're starting to get answers.
"BlueLu has some awesome advice, there are great meds out there and I would advocate for finding dietary triggers, reducing stress (seems impossible now, I know, but you got this) and exercise. I know exercising is the last thing you want to do - it wasn't too long ago I was feeling the same way you are - I remember I would do two minutes on the treadmill, then walk up the block, then walk around the block... It took time but I crawled out of my flare."
If you get a clear diagnosis let me know because we have the exact same symptoms and blood markers except mine were borderline this time. Previously I had positive dsDNA but last AVISE test they were negative with weak positive ANA and borderline SSA.
"Oh, and for the weird roaming headache, try saline and blowing your nose hard enough to pop you ears a bit. I was this close to a CT scan this week with insane face, eyes and neck headache and when I did that - boom, it went away. I guess it was some sort of pressure on nerves? No idea but it sucks. Do you have hypermobility syndrome?"
Hey thanks for replying. Yes bc of the costochondritis they had me taking ibuprofen 3x a day just for a week. It seemed to help so I took it once a day for the next week. After ppcm every doctor told me no nsaids so I literally hadn’t taken them since feb 2018. So yea that definitely could have caused the reflux.
Thank you. yea we actually just ordered a treadmill so that’s good to know exercise could help.
I will let you know what the rheumatologist says and no I don’t have hypermobility. I will give the saline a try!
"CeeLee67 are you a zebra?  I have EDS, this and Hashimoto's.  All of this sucks. But life goes on. Have a great day."
"Yep, Zebra here. My autoimmune issues aren't quite determined - my autoantibodies go up and down (dsDNA and SSA) and my ANA is pretty low. So I'm not sure if the EDS causes the autoimmune stuff, or autoimmune is secondary, or what. I think a lot for me is Mast Cell issues - maybe not full-blown MCAS, but when they do act up it is a real problem and a lot of health issues cascade. Thankfully it doesn't typically last too long before I get a reset. Like last night my SI joint subluxed right before bed and then I had a mast attack with itchy ears, cramping legs, insomnia, joint pain - but I also had a peanut butter sandwich before bed so what that the cause? Ugh, it's exhausting. I took some Tylenol and Zrytec and finally fell asleep at 2 a.m."
"I am always a mess, but on top of the  Hashimoto's and EDS, I have Söjgrins syndrome, another autoimmuneat. Ô disorder and a birth defect that caused a lot of bleeds in my brain that is called an AVM . I don't know if I have any problems with MCAS or not. I need to look into that more. The chances of my having POTS is very high. So I need to be tested for that. I'm just tired of feeling like crap. I have had this burning, itching, like my skin where I itch is on fire. I have had it like a week, they put me on Hydroxyzine, I have taken it for 2 days, now today (yesterday) I have a killer of what feels like a rebound headache, so I haven't taken any today, (well it being 1 am I guess it was yesterday.) So I itch like crazy plus my head hurts.  Back to the Doctor. I hate when new things crop up. It is frustrating."
Sounds a lot like Mast Cell activation - have you tried Zyrtec?
"I used it before, But I can't take it. I had a reaction to it. The only thing I can think of that I ate different was pork. I will have to check with my daughter which day I ate that. They are starting me on prednisone today. That should also knock out my headache. This is the first time I have gotten the itchys like this. Any time in the past it was only my palms, and putting my hands in very cold water made it go away. Thanks for the info. Now I have to talk to talk to my Dr about that too."
Is it blepharitis
I had all of that too.  Numbness was what sent me to the doc originally.

Wouldn’t hurt to see a rheum.
"The Rheumatologist will test for ANA, SSA, SSB and a few others.  Some require a tear test and/or biopsy of salivary glands in the absence of positive labs."
I’d probably start with an internist/general doctor if you haven’t yet.  I would think your symptoms could be a lot of things.
"You would first need to know for sure if it is an actual autoimmune disorder. Then those are symptoms of a lot of autoimmune disorders. Mine looked just like my 2 sisters, they both have MS, but I started reading things you can have other than MS. I came upon this. And I was like, yes this is more like what it is. And just after telling one of my MS sisters this is more like what I have, I had a problem with my eye. I thought I had (conjunctivitis) pink eye, but it wasn't nasty and yucky, it just felt like sand was in my eyes, my eye drops and gel did nothing to help it. When I finally went in my FNP told me then and there I have SS. Because I already have one autoimmune disorder doing some of the tests would have been useless, others she said wouldn't be covered, and could cost me thousands of dollars.  Once she diagnosed me she started treating me worse and worse. I finally had to switch from her to another FNP. And now I just got a letter saying my new fantastic New FNP is leaving, and I will be getting another new one."
"I have white gunk in the side of my eyes, but you can only see it when I pill the eye more open and look into the back of the socket. They look normal other wise."

&#x200B;

"This would show up in a standard blood test for infection, wouldn't it?"
You had every single symptom I Have? No variation?
I got an ANA test will that tell me if I have it?
"I am a female and it hit me in my early 30s, but I had most of those plus some.  I had numbness in my hands and feet (specifically the balls of my feet), random twitches, deep pain down to the bone on the left leg, weird weakness in the left wrist, a bad rash across my face, heavy fatigue.. and even dizziness.  Dry eyes and mouth came later.  Good luck to you."
Also globus sensation and reflux.
"Like I said, that is what this NP said. But who knows with her. At least my eye Doctor who did the test, Shoot I can't remember the name... Where they put the paper in your eyes? Mine came out just kind of wet where it touched my eyeballs. He said oh yeah I will second that diagnosis without a problem. So that is what we are going by. I have had symptoms for years, but it was just no tests, no fighting, just boom one day here you have SS. I was like ok. And others fight for many years for a Doctor to finally say those words."
Is there a sure fire way to diagnose it?

Is it weird that only one eye has trouble producing tears?
"I’d say the primary symptom of Sjögren’s is the dryness of eyes, mouth, nose etc, so if you don’t have those symptoms it might be that you have a different autoimmune condition."
"I’m sorry you are going through this with no answers. There are a few differential diagnosis that can mimic Sjogrens. To me, your symptoms sound very similar to fibromyalgia. Have you looked into that as being a cause? Do you have any dryness?"
"Also, you should be aware that Sjogrens can take years to diagnose and show positive results. I wouldn’t completely rule it out, but be aware of the other conditions that can cause pain and fatigue."
">sleeping problems, fatigue, loss of appetite"

"have you had your thyroid tested? TSH, ft3, ft4?"
"Thank you for taking the time to reply. I did look indeed into it, but it seems that in our health care system (Switzerland) this condition isn't highly thought of among doctors. I haven't had a single doctor voice this. I do have some dryness: in the eyes, it's almost a burning sensation, and my teeth feel as if thy have developed a lot of 'ridges' in the past few years which my dentist was able to confirm. I have dry lips all the time and need to almost constantly sip water. That's what I was also thinking of, that it takes a few years to develop. However, the doctor who performed the lip biopsy said it's highly unlikely that I'd have so many symptoms and not show any antibodies."
"I think I have, but thank you anyway :("
My bloodwork has always been negative for antibodies. For over 3 years I suffered from a range of symptoms and only until my dry mouth and eyes got so unbearable did I push for a lip biopsy. My biopsy was positive for Sjogrens and it shocked my doctor. He told me that even people who have positive antibodies in their bloodwork may never have a positive biopsy. So a negative lip biopsy does not rule Sjogrens out. The diagnosis is made by looking at the whole picture.

I suggest to keep looking for a doctor who will listen and to see an Ophthamologist if you haven’t. If you have dry eyes it may help in your diagnosis to get a Schirmer test done to see if your tear production is low.
Can you post your results with ranges then?

"Because what you described sounds like hashimoto's, and being within range is not enough. My symptoms (what you listed basically, plus a horrible depression) were dismissed because my thyroid tests were ""normal"", only after my thyroid gave out completely and my tests got really bad was I sent to a specialist who looked at my old tests and said I should've been medicated years before. Many people walk around with every hashi symptom under the sun but are not treated because their doctors don't know what they're doing, they look at their tests, see nothing is out of range and dismiss thyroid issues as a possible reason for their health problems."
"I've done all this. I changed to another doctor who was willing to do the lip biopsy, and I also went to an ophthalmologist. I only seem to get doctors that don't really care but just shrug it off as inexplainable. My eye doctor did the Schirmer test, but I think he messed it up. He didn't even have a timer ready, so he had to go find one which all added up to the time. So in the end, I had a somewhat inconclusive result of 8mm in roughly 6 minutes, so that's that. I got a prescription for an eye gel which is supposed to work better that drops, but on some days my eyes just burn like hell no matter what I do."
"Current TSH 2.39 mU/l (ref. 0.10-4.00) - last year, it showed 0.61 and then went up to 4.72 half a year later, I have no idea if this means anything. I have ruled out Hashimotos because I actually struggle to eat and have lost a few kilos, I'd say I'm borderline underweight at the moment. I can't find ft3 and ft4 in my documents but I'm 100 % sure they've been tested - I'll try and find them!"
I wanted to also do the lip biopsy but my ENT told me that even if my biopsy showed mild inflammation that it isn't enough to diagnose me with Sjogren's. So what's next for me?
"Hi, I've been kinda busy but I keep meaning to reply to this."

"TSH of 2,39 is not great - 95% of healthy people have a TSH below 2,5. The ranges are being constantly updated - just 5 years ago the upper limit was 5, these days it's 4,2, some organizations in the US consider anything over 3 a sign of being hypo according to a book I'm currently reading."

"Regarding the up and down pattern of your TSH levels - Our thyroid contains hormones. When our immune system is destroying the gland, it will sometimes release a lot of hormone at once into the bloodstream which will then cause a period of hyperthyroidism, then you go hypo again. Occasional periods of hyperthyroidism between being hypo and ""normal"" (on paper anyway) are very typical of in the early stages of Hashimoto's."

"Having a low appetite was one of my main symptoms before being diagnosed, alongside depression, extreme fatigue and insomnia. I was absolutely disgusted with food. I was not fat though, actually on the lower end of normal for years while having major hypo symptoms, it was only in the last months at the very end that I gained some weight. I think me being skinny was one of the reasons no one suspected I might have hashi."

"All in all, the information you gave in this comment makes me think it's quite likely you have underactive thyroid. I think your best bet right now would be to test your anti-thyroid antibodies (aTPO) and, if you can, also aTG (these are present in Graves which causes hyperthyroidism), repeat the full thyroid panel (TSH, FT3, FT4) and get a thyroid ultrasound, making sure they measure it and give you its measurements that you can then use to calculate its volume"

">Longitudinal and transverse scans are performed allowing the measurements of the depth (d), the width (w) and the length (l) of each lobe. The volume of the lobe is calculated by the formula : V (ml) = 0.479 x d x w x 1 (cm). The thyroid volume is the sum of the volumes of both lobes."

"Then of course I'd advise you to go to a good endocrynologist - one that treats symptoms, not test results. There are a lot of doctors who will dismiss you as long as your TSH is not over the 4,2 or whatever the lab ranges are where you live, and then there are proper endos who know that your hormones can be within range but still too low, and that many people have symptoms way before things get bad enough for the TSH to go over 4,2. My doc keeps me at a TSH around 1, preferably below, somewhere around 0,8 (as long as FT3 and 4 are not showing I'm hyper) because that's where some people feel best, me included. I'm absolutely miserable when my TSH is at 2,3."

"I think I saw something in German in your most recent posts, this book has pretty useful information on hashimoto and has a table showing healthy thyroid volume depending on sex/age, though of course you can find it online too (mine is half the size it should be)"

https://www.amazon.de/Leben-mit-Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis-Ein-Ratgeber/dp/3863711963


At the moment I'm reading this book.

https://www.amazon.com/Hashimotos-Protocol-Reversing-Thyroid-Symptoms/dp/006257129X

"I can't say if the method works yet as I just started reading but if you do have hashi, it might be useful to you as it addresses the cause for autoimmune issues, instead of just its symptoms, and apparently can help reverse thyroid damage and even help people get off meds or seriously lower the dose of hormones. Autoimmune diseases like to travel together so it's important to get to the core of the problem. The author was undiagnosed for years herself and describes the symtoms in the book (for her, it was mostly cognitive and mental health issues, depression, very low energy and feeling cold all the time, which is very common)."

"All in all, virtually every system can be affected as every organ in our body contains thyroid hormone receptors. And just because you don't have ceratin symptoms doesn't mean it's not hashi - it doesn't look the same for everyone, for example I don't sleep when hypo and am very sleepy when hyper, which is the opposite of what most people expercience."

You can also check this site https://stopthethyroidmadness.com/symptoms/
"I really don't know. Have you had an ultrasound of the salivary glands yet? That's all I could think of that's left, so my ENT is willing to do that next week. If that yields no results, I'll give up. I've already signed up for psychotherapy because all my doctors now believe it's psychosomatic but I feel horrible almost every day."
"You get back at me weeks after I even posted. I'm really touched, thank you. That's more effort all of my doctors together have put in, and I appreciate this so much. I've been thinking hormonal issues as well these last days - had my period during the weekend and it felt like going through hell! I've scheduled an appointment with my gyn, hopefully she can refer me somewhere. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"No problem! I lost several years to hypothyroidism and was told it was all in my head because my TSH was 3,5, only to hear from my endo (once my TSH rose to 5,5 and I was diagnosed and referred to a specialist) that my previous tests were bad and I should have been put on meds years ago! I wish someone told me to check my thyroid more thorougly back then."

"As for periods, agan, not everyone has the same symptoms, but typically in hypothyroidism your bleeding will be heavy and your cycles longer (I had cycles nearly 40 days long at the point of diagnosis)."

"One thing I forgot to add, aTPO levels go up and down too (in hashi there are periods where your body will have more inflammation due to stress, diet etc) so if your levels are low, that doesn't necessarily exclude hashimoto. That's why it's important to do all the tests, and have an ultrasound to see what's actually happening."

"Hope that helps, and good luck getting to the root of your problems :)"

"P.S. I might edit those comments later as they're quite personal/identifying if someone knows me, so I'll copy both and send them to you as a PM."
I use xylitol pills that stick to my gum while sleeping. They melt slowly (5-7 hours) and I don't wake up with a dry mouth.
There is a difference - xylitol is supposed to help stimulate saliva flow.

I like ACT lozenges (found them with the toothpaste) but xylitol gum is fine (I like IceBreakers Ice Cubes because they don't have that dry hard shell that a lot of gum does nowadays and there are a lot of great milder flavors).
"I am not a fan of hard candies or lozenges in general (not related to treating dry mouth, I just can't get past feeling like I'm going to choke on them), so I chew xylitol gums.  Those really help me a lot and can also help with dental issues related to dry mouth and potentially reduce the chances of getting cavities.  Be aware, xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and is also in many other dry mouth treatments (also lots of people foods), just fyi."
Does it bother you? I just learned about those but I'm worried I would feel it all night. It would be lovely to not feel like this every morning:

do they have a name? :)
[deleted]
"Hi 'not a fan of hard candies or lozenges in general (not related to treating dry mouth', im DAD."
"No, you'll forget about it."
XyliMelts.
"I like the Trident fruit flavors and the bubblegum flavor ones.  Also, stick with the original gum line, not the layers or splash ones, I don't think those have xylitol in them.  The unwrapped ones are the same as their wrapped version if you want to avoid wrappers (the plastic tubs and bags are probably less recyclable and more wasteful than the paper though).  The other thing I like about gum more than lozenges is that I don't make my tongue sore fiddling with it."

"I forgot to mention, I also switched to only fruity toothpaste and mouthwash.  I have found that mint flavors found in toothpaste and gums irritate my mouth and makes dryness much worse.  Totally use kids toothpaste and mouthwashes!"
thank you
"Naps in a cold, dark room with a cool mist humidifier pointed at your head."

There are some warming pads for your eyes that are supposed to help. I forget what that's called too. I prefer this little ice pack I have for migraines over my eyes. A cold wet washcloth can help a little bit too.

"The steam from a hot shower is good for aches and dryness (at first, but hot water can dry you out too, so be sure to moisturize after)"

A little bit of CeraVe moisturizer on your eyelids can help.

"Water but also consider adding electrolytes. Gatorade is the easiest to find but you might also like Natural Calm (magnesium) with some lite salt (available by the regular table salt, it's salt and potassium). TriOral on Amazon is very good and I've heard good things about Nuun tablets. There are others but I can't remember the names."

I also find coconut water and aloe vera juice very hydrating.

Ice cream or sorbet or something. Something about staying cool helps me feel better.

"Take it easy, try not to do anything that can wait. I take days off from the gym when I'm flaring, the only possible exception would be something very chill like a Zen yoga class."

Fish oil.

Take your meds.
Warm compresses can help with my eyes when they get bad. It doesn't make it all better but it can help with comfort a bit.
"Herbal tea: chamomile and peppermint. Lots of sleep, water, Epsom salt baths, rest."
It’s a struggle huh. I’m having a crap time at the moment too xxxx
"All of this. And just one more time: take it easy. Do only what you need to do. My biggest issue myself is when I think I'm taking it easy but I stay up too late watching tv. Just because I didn't do a lot, doesn't mean I get to lose sleep. That just makes it worse. I have to remind myself all the time."
Thank you so much. I’ve got a tub of electrolyte tablets that I always forget to take when I’m feeling bad. So I’ve already had some right after reading your post.

"I don’t have a gym class for another 4 days, if I still feel crap I will cancel it."

Thanks again for your help. I’ll be picking up a few things tomorrow. Will be referring to this :)
"Seconding the recommendation on the Nuun hydration tablets. I’ve been using them for a few years now and they make the summers more bearable and I also use them in my water bottle to exercise. There’s several flavors that are good, but fruit punch is my favorite, followed by lemon lime."
I keep wondering about the nuun tablets. I think I'll give them a shot next time I'm shopping.
"You mentioned thirst. Sjögren's Syndrome causes dry mouth, not thirst. Were you tested for diabetes?"

"I have both type one diabetes and Sjögren's Syndrome, and there's a very distinct difference between dry mouth and being thirsty."

Edit: Diabetes makes me want to chug water. Sjögren's Syndrome makes me want to dampen my mouth to make it slippery again.
"I just want to add that be careful going to online support groups. I get a lot out of them, but I'm really sick. Most people with these disorders have better things to do than hang out in a disease forum; only those of us who can do little else have the time to spend there. There are lots of helpful people, don't get me wrong, but it's mostly the 10% of us who feel the shittiest."
"I was diagnosed when I was about your age. If your rheumatoid/ANA numbers are high and you also have high SS-A/SS-B, there’s a good chance you have Sjogren’s, especially if you have symptoms already present."

"Your symptoms may never get worse, though. For me personally, the worse I’ve felt is flu-like symptoms during a flare-up and pain in my jaw. Some people also develop additional autoimmune disorders, but you shouldn’t worry about that until a rheumatologist can properly diagnose you."
"Any presence of ANA or specific auto-antibodies is cause for some concern. At the very least, a trip to a rheumatologist to see if further diagnostics are required. I am actually one of the few who doesn't have the antibodies, but received a Sjorens diagnosis for other issues. Chronic, extreme dry mouth, dry eye, and gland issues in my mouth. I will say the dryness from Sjorens is not the same as simply being thirsty; its different. It's a feeling of cottonmouth that cannot be relieved. Your mouth will dry up as you speak, you will constantly feel the need to lick your lips to try to moisten your mouth, but to no avail. I have to drink water while i'm having conversations with people. My voice is typically hoarse, especially when i'm having worsening symptoms. My eyes feel like a vacuum is suctioning up all of the moisture, Gritty, sandpaper feeling. I have a ""mild"" case, so for the most part, you will most likely experience the hallmark signs of dry eyes and mouth. I wish you luck and i'm very sorry you are experiencing this. It's such an uncomfortably annoying disease that makes so little sense."

"Thank you for saying this. It can become such an incredibly dark road for people who may or may not have an autoimmune disease. It's easy to google symptoms and to stumble upon a forum with worst case scenarios, causing anxiety and paranoia. I have Sjorens and I chose to avoid the forums and groups for this reason."
"Yeah, I think that's a problem when patients have to self-report something like dry mouth. I had it for 30 years and didn't realize it was drier than normal. I mean...how would I know?"
"I had a friend join one of my groups just so she can hear the other stories and something might ring a bell for her concerning her own quirky health issues. But man, she had a terrible reaction to all the agony and despair she perceived."
I felt really bad about imposing that on her without knowing her well enough to understand how she'd internalize it.
"The current products seem to be geared towards people with mild dry mouth. With no saliva to protect my oral tissues, the most recommended brand, Biotene, burns tf out of my mouth and isn't at all effective. The gels available to coat the mouth are disgusting and kind of sweet. Mint is used a lot and there's no way that I can tolerate mint in the slightest. Many products are made with xylitol, which leaves something like burn marks in my mouth. I can't tolerate it at all, I assume, because I don't have saliva for protection. I'm not sure if any products address ph changes due to dryness, which would be nice. The one product that I desperately wish to try but have not had the opportunity is Neutrasal. When my mouth is really off and everything is sticking together, I think that it could be mildly beneficial."

"If it helps, the result of my saliva flow and volume testing was zero."
"I haven’t had any success using any of the biotene products. I occasionally use ACT dry mouth spray, which does help but it doesn’t last very long. The only thing I’ve found to actually work is the prescription drug Evoxac. It effectively stimulates salivary gland production within 15-25 minutes. Although it does work well, it’s worth noting that the quality of saliva is more watery and not as lubricating as naturally produced saliva is."
I usually use a spray (biotene brand I think) and like it okay. However it doesn't last long and it would be fantastic if my mouth didn't feel like mentos ad (that mint taste) after using any dry mouth products.
"Best thing on the market for me was Orajel dry mouth gel. They quit making it years ago. Couldn't use Biotene gel so I started making my own with glycerin,  xylitol, and zantham gum. I also use Therabreath dry mouth mints."
"The products like lozenges or mints (Act, Therabreath) don't work for me because with zero saliva in my mouth I can have one in my mouth for well over an hour without it melting at all. Then the mint sort of burns your tongue and roof of mouth where it's been sitting for the last hour."

"I have tried Biotene gel and rinse, which were ok while they were in my mouth, but then the minute they were out of my mouth that was pretty much it. Back to being dry again. Same with the Act spray."

I've used Biotene and Act toothpastes for dry mouth and don't think they do anything at all once I've rinsed and spit.

I've tried gums targeted for dry mouth and gums that contain xylitol (which are much cheaper but same active ingredient). They help for the first ten minutes or so and that's it.

"I wish something worked because since being affected by Sjogrens, my mouth has gotten worse as far as cavities go -- even though I've become more diligent about my oral care routine. It's hard when you have close to zero saliva."
"My best success has been with medication, unfortunately. I take Saligen. Biotene was my go too, mouthwash and gum, but it doesn’t last all day long."
"I've used Biotene products...doesn't last very long. Gum is my go-to but even then...I've just learned to get used to and put up with the dryness. I use a humidifier every night...I'm still very dry, but it's definitely better than not having it."
"My mum has Sjogrens, and recommends sesame oil rubbed around her gums and teeth to help. She does this when she has really bad symptoms. Hopefully that can help you."
What is your recipe - what parts of each do you use? Thanks
"I mix 1/2 cup glycerin, 1 tsp xanthan gum, 3 Tbsp xylitol in a small saucepan. I let this mixture warm till xylitol is melted. I then add a splash of distilled water then it should start to gel. I let this mixture cool completely before putting into 2 plastic containers. I use one in the bathroom and one in my purse."
I’m using low dose naltrexone just started but already helpful. It’s not known for sever sideffects. Research at LDN science. Com or . .Org

"Why do people keep getting the biopsy?  What is the benefit?  You’re still left with the same symptoms, regardless.  Quit letting doctors perform a risky procedure with no benefit."
"It felt like a mouth sore. Whenever I got food around it, it hurt and I needed to drink water to clean the area. Eating hard food that doesn't drip into it was easier. It didn't hurt when I wasn't not eating."
I don't recall it being that bad when I got mine. You should call your doctor.
I would contact the doc considering its impacting you that much.
"I was sore, but not excessively so. Check with the doctor that did the biopsy to see if there's something they can suggest you do."
"holy shit, the drive home, after the meds wore off. i was in so much fucking pain driving :( but the pain was just that night."
Took me over a year to get fully recovered from lip biopsy
"Some people have negative bloodwork, and its the only way to know if they have Sjorgren's."
I've considered getting it just for my own peace of mind. I've spent my life seeing doctors who guess one thing or another or just straight up tell me it's all in my head. Having a real diagnosis feels like something I can shove in doctor's faces (metaphorically) and to prove to myself and my family that I really am sick.
But that's all my own baggage and right now the pros don't outweigh the cons. My bloodwork is all negative but I've got the symptoms. I am fortunate that I think I'll be able to get treatment for the symptoms even without the official diagnosis.
"Yeah it's the next morning now and it's not too bad but fuck me I was in pain after the anaesthetic wore off, migraines and all sorts!"
But what does it matter if you know you have it or not if you’re still having the same symptoms?
Maybe docs won't treat without it? I know I'm having a lot of issues even getting a doc to take my Hashimoto's seriously because bloodwork only shows antibodies out of whack. I have nothing saying sjogrens yet (just symptoms and a doc believing so) so I'd imagine trying to get them to treat me would be an issue.
"Probably because without a formal diagnosis from a doctor, you'll miss out on things like leeway from your employer, access to a rheumatologist/physiotherapist, proper prescription medication etc. There's plenty of reasons to get a biopsy if your bloods come back negative."
"I was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy first, and they did the biopsy after all the other tests that might explain it came back negative."

There are other things that aren't autoimmune that can cause the basic symptoms of Sjorgren's (and even more that can cause neuropathy). Not knowing means you can't treat the underlying cause.

"With a diagnosis of Sjorgren's, I can get disease modifying drugs that might make my neuropathy better. I lost my insurance before I could explore that fully, but without it, my treatment would have been more poking around in the dark treating symptoms without knowing it was autoimmune. Now I have a target."

"Its also useful to know that your body is prone to trying to destroy itself - when you have an autoimmune condition, your healing time is slower, you can be more prone to infection.. stuff I wish I knew before I had surgery (I had a useless spinal cord stimulator implanted). The diagnosis was at a different hospital and they didn't think to look at my chart before they cut me open (I hadn't really dug into what it all meant yet, so I didn't think to raise the issue), so my recovery took way too long and I probably shouldn't have let them do it in the first place. It triggered a major flare up too, and my neuropathy got worse."

"Its also an explanation for the fatigue, the aches and pains - there's more to having an autoimmune disorder than just dry eyes and mouth, and Sjorgren's is an autoimmune disorder."
Where I live I need an official diagnosis to get benefits from the government. You also need the diagnosis to get any kind of possible treatment.
"No treatment without a diagnosis. My blood work is persistently negative, and I was only diagnosed through a lip biopsy."
Exactly drs won’t treat us!!!! I had zero pain with my biopsy. During or after. I’m glad I have it bc I have a chance at feeling better again
I freely admit that the idea of the biopsy is not appealing at all to me. I'm really hoping that something pops up that explains what I experience without that level of testing.
I didn’t want it either but my neurologist refers to a plastic surgeoun only to avoid a lot of these nerve complications. I literally didn’t even need an Advil after. No pain ever and I was worried. My Ana was high but not the sjogrens specific antibodies but it showed up in the biopsy and now I have treatment options. I recommend a plastic surgeoun
My ana was negative but the sjogrens specific bloodwork wasn't completed. Apparently they didn't take enough blood when I was there. They basically said since they were referring me to rheumatology and endocrinology that I should just allow them to do it.
My Rheumatologist put me on Plaquenil and Celebrex. The Plaquenil takes 3 months to build up in your system I'm just starting month 2.  That's all I can get till i6get an accurate diagnosis. This itching is enough to drive you insane though.
"The only thing that ever worked for me is an extreme process of elimination diet.  For best response, at least 90 days of nothing but extreme non-inflammatory diet before adding anything in."
Have you seen your doctor or a dermatologist so they can help get to the root of the problem for you?
Last time I got a rash was when I used a cream called fucidin.
I’m trying to get a diagnosis as I think I have SS and just last week this started happening to me. I thought it was an allergic reaction to an SSRI but it has been 6 days since I stopped taking it and I still broke out with some hives today. I think it may be all related. I have been taking benadryl which knocks me on my ass but it mostly keeps the rashes at bay. I hope you find relief soon
Thank you I will look into it.
I have an appt. on May 15 for a skin biopsy.
"Fuckin'-A, man. I got a rash, man. Fuckin'-A."
"I had a horrible itchy welt at the site of my Humira injection. Raised, hot, and **THE ITCH**. Also had full body redness and hives with Rituxan. The magic relief isn’t just Benadryl. It’s **BENADRYL + ZANTAC**. I had to take the combo for 10 days, morning and night, prior to my infusion to stave off the reaction, and it worked. With Humira, I took it for 2 or 3 days ahead of time and a couple of times after. I eventually stopped reacting, just in time to start a different medication."
"I'm having a skin and lip biopsy in May, so no definite diagnosis as of yet, however I have almost every symptom for Sjogrens. I also eliminated meds but it didn't help.  I'm taking 2 zyrtec a day along with benadryl, it helps a little but still super itchy. It's driving me mad!"
Have you gotten the results yet from your biopsy?
Thank you!! I’ll grab some zantac
"I feel you. I also am going mad. I am seeing an ENT in May to get everything started. My worst/most noticeable symptom is dry mouth hence my PCP referring me to an ENT but I do have dry eyes at times, fatigue, and now these hives. My doctor believes my symptoms are stress/anxiety related (mind you, my anxiety is BAD) but I am not convinced. I just want a damn diagnosis so I can get started on treatment."
"It really was a game changer for me. You need the 150mg, and I do not recommend the mint. It’s supposed to be an acid reducer, but it got me feeling sick. Good luck!"
The Zantac taken with an antihistamine is useful because apparently there’s H1 and H2 histamine receptors or something along those lines and the Zantac works to reduce the “other” histamine type that the Benadryl or Zyrtec doesn’t block. A nurse at my old Rheumie’s office told me about this when I first developed full body itchy hives back in 2009. I’ve been getting them on and off ever since. The only thing that helps is a medication called Hydroxyzine (Atarax) which is an antihistamine an old school one I guess. Benadryl and Zyrtec don’t even make a dent in my hives :(
"I was just recently diagnosed, so my symptoms are not as bad as some.  The two things I found most helpful for dryness were:"

"1. I had blepharitis (oil glands on the eyelid blocked) with my dry eyes.  Warm compresses on the eyes a couple times a day for about a week took care of the blepharitis and resulted in (I presume) increased oil secretion , which in turn helped keep the eyes moisturized for a much longer duration.  I use the compresses regularly now to keep the oil secretions flowing."
"2. My throat was drier than my mouth, and would become very irritated any time I talked a lot or had to breath through my mouth (eg during moderate exercise).  Biotene oral spay is pretty useful to help manage the throat dryness - one spray in the mouth, and one spray to the back of the throat before exercising really helps."
"Warm compresses on the face are great in the morning. I also take a towel and put my face over my cool mist humidifier and it completely moisturizes my eyes and face. It even feels good on the skin! Eye drops before bed. I have been waking up and using the dry mouth rinse because my mouth is so dry at night. The drops and rinse are only temporary. I feel that nothing helps long term! Although Plaquenil has helped my muscles tremendously. I no longer get red, hot, sore muscles in my shoulders and I do not get tendinitis as much. Sunglasses are a must! Q"
"I rub Burt’s Bees on my eyelids to make them water. It works really well. I went to look this up once when a friend told me I was “the only person who did it”. I wasn’t. It turns out to have been a fad in 2014, called “beezin’ “."

I wish I was kidding.
"Biotene, pilocarpine (Saligen)"
"Cevimeline, xylimelts, neti pot, theratears, restasis"
Zolly pops are tasty and have xylitol so I sometimes use at night if my mouth get really dry. I also bought a portable nebulizer for my lungs. I can take a few hits in the car when I’m out and lungs are dry. I’ll prob get pulled over one of these days!
NAC
"I use spry mints, biotene tabs for dry mouth.  Rephresh Mega 3 drops with flaxseed oil, Genteal PM eye gel at nite, and put coconut oil on my eyes and lashes.  I also do yoga regularly and have become a certified Reiki therapist to keep my energy levels up.   Have recently been leaning towards a plant based diet which improves the way i feel."
"Oh yes, my son gets blepharitis, too! Very good suggestions. Thank you!"
"I love this. I run a humidifier, but I am totally going to start sticking my face over it in the morning!! I started plaquenil about 6 months ago and didn't see any change for awhile, until I ran out and decided not to refill it. Then, oh man, I figured out what it was doing REAL fast. Thanks for sharing!"
wow - this is really creative!!
"Yup, just restocked my Biotene supply. Thanks for reminding me :)"
"Okay, the only one here I knew about was TheraTears. Great additions. THANK YOU!"
Brilliant! The nebulizer is a really smart one!
I haven't heard of this - thanks for sharing!
"As in, N Acetyl cysteine? (NAC)?"
"Yes, I am back on biotene and it does help!! I love yoga and pilates. I wrote a whole post about it, because it's helped so much. I've heard about REiki and my BFF is a Reiki Master and says it's transformed her fibro. I want to interview her for the blog!"
"Haha! It's the best I promise. If the humidifier is on the floor, sit in front if it and put your face directly over it, with a towel around the humidifier and over your head. It's great! My grandma used to have us do that over a warm mist humidifier when we were sick, it helps with congestion. My daughter was really sick last month and I had her do this with the humidifier and she loved it, said it made her feel a lot better! Plaquenil is great. Last year at this time I felt like I needed euthanized!"
"Thanks. I also have seborrheic dermatitis, and rubbing minty things on it helps with the itching. It was just a natural progression."
That would be a good idea.  I saw a program on a woman suffering from fibromyalgia and how reike helped her.  I was desperate so i tried it.  Really helps.
I love it! Great tip! I feel you - the ups and downs of this monster make me feel like an alien has taken over my body. Not cool.
"Hey, Assiramama, just a quick heads-up:"
"**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**."
Have a nice day!

"Yes, products with mint, menthol, etc., are so comforting for me, too!"
"If you suspect Sjogrens, I’d ask for an ANA panel. Different labs test it different ways, but my doctor’s lab then automatically tests for indicators of different autoimmune conditions if the ANA is positive. That’s how mine worked. My ANA was positive, and the subsequent tests it ran showed crazy high SSA and SSB levels."
Lip biopsy is the gold standard. My neuro said most do not ever show positive antibodies for sjogrens I did have positive for double stranded dna. try to get a plastic surgeon to do the biopsy for good results.
Thank you for the response. Will I need to be referred to a rheumatologist for the test?
My only symptom is dry mouth. I don’t have dry/red eyes or anything like that. It could be a number of things but I am especially concerned that I have Sjögren’s. I hope I am just overthinking it. I am honestly pretty scared.
"You should be referred to a rheumatologist who might or might not send you for a salivary scan or lip biopsy to verify objective evidence for dry mouth (as opposed to your complaint, which is a subjective evidence).  If you have the choice I'd do the salivary scan first as its less painful."

&#x200B;

Edit: Until then make sure you're being very conscientious about brushing your teeth. Plaque buildup can happen really quickly for people with dry mouth.  And pick up some Biotene mouth rinse for right before bed.
"I’m positive for Sjogrens with just dry eyes and some minor occasional joint pain. So not everyone has all the same symptoms. A hematologist ordered my ANA panel, so I don’t think it’s limited to rheumatologists, but that could vary I suppose."
Okay. I’ll talk to my doctor about it and hopefully he doesn’t shoot down the idea. My anxiety won’t be at ease until I am 100% sure.
"Yep. I don't have the specific bladder/stomach issues (different ones), but dysautonomia, fatigue, pain all over, but particularly in my rib cage (aka 'the MS hug'), on top of the nose/mouth/eye dryness (causes problems breathing and wakes me up at night) and what I guess is common with sjorgren's but not well understood: small fiber neuropathy causing all sorts of problems, mostly pain/numbness/sensitivity in my extremities (but also affects digestion, blood pressure, and other autonomic stuff)."

"It got to the point where I had to stop working too. I had disability insurance through work but it didn't last, and SSDI is still pending (I'm on my last possible appeal, its been almost 4 years since I initially applied). Its definitely the best thing to do if you can, the best remedy I've found for dealing with these complications of Sjorgren's is being very careful about pacing myself. The 'spoon theory' is a great way to think about it. Trying to produce at work and deal with people (I'm also autistic, so the people thing was exhausting even before I was in pain all the time) just takes too much out of me, and I feel worse and worse and get less and less productive. I need to do things on my own time, be able to rest frequently and take days to recover when I've pushed myself too far. Being able to do that increases my quality of life by a huge factor. Its frustrating since I'm naturally pretty high strung and always wanting to be buzzing around doing stuff (a coworker once called me ""a highly productive individual""), but the pacing is so crucial for me."

"Anyway, you're not alone. A lot of people treat Sjorgren's like its no big deal because they think its all ""dry eyes and dry vaginas"" (especially rough given I'm male) and  nothing serious. But there are tones of people like us that have complications from Sjorgren's or our Sjorgren's is complicated by some other autoimmune thing. Its important for us to talk about it so people know! Thank you for posting."
From what I've heard it can really vary. some people will suffer more than others. For me I mostly suffer with dry mouth and eyes - I use aritificial tears often and spent a couple grand fixing my teeth from Sjogren's decay recently.

"I also have tachycardia, diagnosed as POTS at one point but they're now saying my blood pressure doesn't match up with that portion of the syndrome. I use metoprolol which seems to even me out just fine."

Occasionally I have shortness of breath which I described to my doctor as feeling like my lungs were dry to the point of pain. I carry an Albuterol inhaler which seems to help but I'm really not sure if it's the best thing. I also sleep with a humidifier pointed at me when it's especially bad.

"I probably do have something going on with my stomach as I'm constantly having eczema and dry skin issues which I'm not totally convinced don't have a food allergy as part of the cause. I find that following a hybrid autoimmune Paleo and ""lazy keto"" diet really helps to control my symptoms, but my vice is food so I'm often suffering so I can eat comfort foods. I haven't had this checked out because I am pretty sensitive about my weight and also don't like being told what to eat 😛"

Sjogren's doesn't seem to be very well understood. It seems like a lot of doctors I bump into think it's just dry eyes and dry mouth and not systemic. It really can effect just about everything. But I would also look into seeing if you may have any other autoimmune conditions as that's very common and it helps doctors understand better.

"For work, I work a desk job so I just take it easy quite a bit. Overdoing it can really mess me up. I still walk as much as I'm able just to stay active. Pacing is really key."
Here's a pretty comprehensive book about Sjogren's Syndrome and associated issues.
http://www.painful-bladder.org/pbs_ic_ass_dis.html

"Also, Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation's website is a good resource.  https://www.sjogrens.org/"
I was on metoprolol too but my blood pressure was dropping really low. So he put me on corlanor.
"Not at all sure, but I was diagnosed via lip biopsy. My Rhuemtologist prescribed pilocarpine in addition to the 8 other meds for lupus and fibro. If it is sjogrens, get a good dentist and ophthalmologist on your team."
"So, this was the Sjö test? I remember talking to an opthalmologist about that test last hear (I think here on Reddit) and asked him about the test. If I remember correctly, he said it's a pretty spot on test. I'll see if I can find the conversation."
I was dx with lip biopsy my neuro said only 30% ever have positive antibodies for sjogrens but I did have positive Ana this time . I haven’t for years though.
My heart goes out to you. I was diagnosed with a lip biopsy as my bloodwork was negative for all sjogrens antibodies.
"I was just diagnosed in October, about two years prior my test came back negative! But from what I remember she did a isolated Sjogrens test, it was the Lupus panel that was done that showed positive results."
Yea it was. The Sjo specific blood test. Thank you so much! I was just surprised at the results since everything else has come back negative but tbh it would make so much sense.  Would be great to finally know what’s going on.
Very interesting. Thank you for sharing!
Thank you so much. And mine goes out to you as well. Can you tell me a little about the lip biopsy? I’m wondering if that’s the next step for me and it sounds a little scary.

What made them think of doing the biopsy when all your bloodwork came back negative?
That’s so wild! I was reading a lot about the Sjö panel and it looks like there’s a lot of overlap with Lupus. Did you have to get additional tests or a lip biopsy for diagnosis?
It wasn't a big deal for me at all. I was referred to an EMT to do the procedure. It was pretty numbed so I really didn't feel anything. I am not fearful of needles so that made it easier. I think the biopsy is the way to go if you want to know for sure. I know some Dr's will treat for symptoms alone but I personally just wanted to know--to prove it wasn't all in my head.

"The worst part was after the procedure when it started to hurt... enough that I had to cancel my plans for that evening. It throbbed a lot. But I took pain meds and though it was swollen and bruised for a bit, it healed with no complications. I had a small bump I could feel on my lip for awhile but that went away. For me it was well worth it to have a definitive diagnosis."

I wanted it due to my symptoms of debilitating fatigue and dry eye. Good luck!
"No, I did not. My ANA was negative and I only have SSA antibodies and my rheumatoid factor was 114 (normal is less than 14) I also have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. I just found out at my disability hearing that my rheumatologist has not even confirmed SS yet. I have been having alot of chest tightness and shortness of breath and he wants to rule out asthma. He has not yet ruled out Lupus either. So it makes me wonder, does he think this is secondary to something else? Or is it primary and it's the only thing causing the symptoms. My grandma had terrible rheumatoid arthritis. Not sure exactly what the deal is but my PCP gladly accepted the diagnosis. She told me that she thought it was that as soon as I made a connection between red, bloodshot, gritty irritated eyes with light sensitivity and headaches, and fatigue and muscle pain and weankess & and numbness and tingling in my extremities. I had a terrible flare up this summer and could not move for two months. I am bipolar so I thought at first I was just in a depression phase but I feel so weaaaak. Bad headaches and I was treating my eyes as allergies (nothing helped!) Muscles in my back were sore and hot to the touch but my body is always very warm. For two years I suffered with extremely sore muscles in my shoulders. I was living like it was normal, I realized how abnormal it was after feeling better with predinose and I noticed it made my breathing easier too. I honestly think I have Lupus. I have been thinking about switching my doctor because he seems to want to brush things off because of my age (31). Tells me to file for disability but when my hearing came up he wouldn't ""confirm"". I filed four years ago anyway so it wasn't anything new. Guess he has his reasons."
Edit: ENT.  Also other stuff in my bloodwork was weird like I had elevated sed rate which is a marker of inflammation and positive rheumatoid factor  so even though I didn't have antibodies my bloodwork and symptoms were enough to make me decide to go through with the lip biopsy.
Thanks so much for your response. I’m ok with needles too (have had lots of piercings and tattoos) so I think it wouldn’t be too awful for me. I completely agree with you that I just want a definitive diagnosis to confirm it’s not all in my head. My main symptoms are fatigue and dry eyes too.

Do the skin around your eyes get red due to the dryness? That was the first sign where I realized “oh wait maybe something else is going on here.”
"Whoa you sound a lot like me. I’m 32 and also have severe chronic depression (some psychs have thought it was bipolar type 2), so I thought my physical symptoms were manifestations of that. Have even been told as much by several doctors. The first rheumatologist I saw brushed  me off completely due to my negative ANA, CRP, and Rheum Factor results. Also negative SSA and SSB. She didn’t even think to offer me this panel."

My eyes have gotten more dry over the past year - often the skin around them is red and they are itchy and painful. Never really had mouth dryness that I’m aware of. I get a lot of bad headaches which have recently been migraines. My body is so sore it’s hard to do anything physical. And the shoulder and back pain! It is like a painful burning sensation. Really awful. My worst symptom over all is fatigue. I’m so exhausted all the time I can barely function. I’m a grad student and researcher and the brain fog has severely impacted my ability to do my job. I can’t think straight.

I feel for you. You should definitely try to find another doctor if you can who will support your disability claim. I really hope it works out for you.

"We are literally the same people then! I was told by psychiatrist and the rheumatologist, that with depression and anxiety, your body is constantly in ""fight or flight mode"" you get upset, adrenaline rushes, lowers again, then the body is tired. That over time, it is just too much for your body, and your CNS and immune system gets all confused and starts to attack itself. The last time I had a mini nervous breakdown, my conjunctiva in my one eye blew up like a blister. It was so weird! Depression n anxiety can also be due to chemical imbalances from different autoimmune diseases and things like that. Truthfully, when I was a kid I came down with mono, Epstein-Barr virus and I never. f*cking. got better. Researchers have recently linked a relation with Epsteinn Barr and Hashimotos Disease, which I'm glad to hear because my mom always felt Epstein Barr ruined my immune system. It causes a mutation of one of the main immunoglobulins, can't remember which one. I just hope one day there is better treatment. I was told it would be an entire immune system transplant as of now. Ive realized the calmer I stay about things the better I feel. Also watch you eat it that plays a big difference, but sometimes that's hard because I sometimes have poor impulses and eat like a cow. Where are you from if you don't mind me asking? I'm in Pittsburgh, PA and for some reason it's an area with alot of autoimmune diseases. They just opened an entire Autoimmune clinic at one of our hospitals. They say we have the best doctors in the world, but have yet to find one to get to the root problem and eliminate it. It's always take this and this and this, see ya later."
"What you said about Epstein-Barr reminded me that my antibodies for it were super high in my test results too. When I was googling around it looks like EBV can trigger Sjögren’s, but also that having an autoimmune issue can cause EBV to re-activate. So idk if I have a current EBV infection, or if it’s just recurring and making everything worse."

"I’ve always been sick with various symptoms, I started getting REALLY sick last year. Used to be an athlete and now can barely walk around without pain. Maybe it all started with an EBV infection."

"I’ve had bad IBS symptoms for a long time so have to be very conscious of what I eat too. Going vegetarian and exercising seemed to control it for a long time, but now I’m totally sapped of energy and get bad IBS flare ups no matter what I do. I eat lots of fruits, veggies, and whole grains but it doesn’t matter."

I’m in California but I’m from the Midwest originally. I think we have a lot of autoimmune disease here too. I went to a talk the other day where a doctor said 45% of people in the US have a chronic illness - and that’s only the ones who can afford and access medical care!

"I am seeing a really good/famous rheumatologist who supposedly solves everyone’s mystery illnesses and it’s the first place that has taken me seriously and not just assumed it was all in my head. The last rheumatologist I saw hadn’t even heard of some of the tests we are trying and just told me to “come back if it gets worse.” Like it didn’t even matter that my symptoms are making my life and identity fall apart. This new doctor isn’t like that at all - though I’m still a little skeptical of the accuracy or relevance of some of their fancy new tests. After all the bad experiences in the med system it is hard to trust. Hence me wondering if anyone has experiences with this particular “Early Sjögren’s Panel.” I did find a lot of clinical research supporting its usefulness and it has actually been around for at least a decade, but I’m still skeptical and want to know about people’s experiences."

"You are right about the EBV reactivating. My PCP was hesitant to admit it's true, but she does keep mononucleosis as one of my main diagnoses in my medical chart so there's that! Correct me if I'm wrong but it effects the lymphocytes count? I always have abnormal lymphocyte count (can't remember if it's high or low) and abnormal neutrophils. I had alot of problems with IBS symptoms too. It started in my early 20s, excruciating stomach pain, and at one point I went to the ER for that and they said it was pancreatitis! They couldn't figure out why but I believe it had something to do with all of the autoimmune problems as I read Sjogrens can cause pancreatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. It started up again about two years ago and I felt it was my gallbladder. I had tests done and I didn't have gallstones but my gallbladder is sluggish."

"I was in a car accident in 2012, where I was ejected out onto the road, and they found out my potassium was low and my thyroid levels were really low too. I wasn't surprised about the thyroid because although I take synthroid my thyroid has never responded well to synthroid and they are constantly increasing or decreasing my meds. There I am with a terrible concussion, fractured sacrum, completely broken tail bone, torn MCL and they are sending in an endocrinologist to talk to me! She said she thought that my intestines are not absorbing my medication and thought maybe I had Celiac. The test came back negative!"

"Where did you go where you heard the doctor speak? I wish there was more support systems for us folks with severe autoimmune problems. I hope they are researching it and trying to figure out a better solution. Honestly, I sit here and think what could have caused all of this? I wonder if it could be insecticides and the other chemicals they spray onto the food that we eat. All of the food that is supposed to be organic is way more expensive than the regular stuff. That is so a$$ backwards. It should be the other way around. Then they tell you it's healthy to drink alot of water, but what the hell is in our water? My dad is an engineer and was telling me how Pittsburgh has not replaced their water lines at all since back in the 30s, and they use cleaner in the water lines and you never know what you are drinking so do not drink tap water. I never allowed my kids to drink tap water, I never trusted it. That may sound crazy but I do believe there are things in our water that cause us to be sick, and has effects on the brain."

"That mystery doctor you are seeing. I need one of those! My family tells me that there should be an impatient facility where people like us go, and they start at the bottom and they don't discharge you until they have gotten to the bottom of everything. We can only wish :) I used to be a really active person too and now I can barely even stand getting up from a sitting position."

"I hope you find some answers, but you are not alone. I believe that false negatives for Sjogrens are pretty common."

Edit: fixed a few typos

My rheumatologist told me that renal issues are one of the less common side effects of sjogrens. We though it might be relevant to me and it turned out it wasn't.  I'd get a second opinion.
"I’ve been suspecting I have renal problems, especially now after I got my vitamin D levels tested and they were so high it’s called hypervitaminosis, and I haven’t even eaten vitamin D pills in a long time. So I read kidney issues can cause that. Anyways, I think you really should get a second opinion!"
"See a urologist about kidney problems, that's not a rheumy's purview. I had low GFR and high creatinine a couple of times when I had bad muscle weakness. Neither my GP nor my rheumy doesn't seem bothered by it, but I was peeing 13-16 times a day. But we can get valve problems, if I'm not mistaken. Usually all our organ issues have to do with valve issues AFAIK."
Have antibodies for Sjogrens but otherwise none of the typical dryness and joint pain symptoms. Long-time sufferer of Raynaud's though.
Had blood tests today for kidney function and creatinine levels.  First time that the bloodwork indicated kidney dysfunction. Will wait to see what doctor says about this.
"Sorry to hear, the waiting game is inevitable and sucks. Hang in there."
"Hmm...doctors not concerned.  That's good to hear. I had similar results. Gfr too low, creatinine too high.  No muscle weakness though. Pee a lot because I hydrate a lot. Have yet to have follow up appointment with my doc."
"Thanks, I'm not peeing quite as much, but my muscles are really weak and achey."
"Sorry to hear about labs, but stay on top of it and hopefully managed properly. Best of luck."

I had the fatigue and neurological symptoms for years before dryness became a daily issue.

Sjögrens can manifest in myriad ways.
Gluten-free has been helping me a lot!
"I’ve done autoimmune paleo for over 4 years. I have 9 disorders and meds failed me. I dropped 15 symptoms, mostly related to my stomach, skin and pain levels. I was able to thin my biofilm on my teeth with mineral powder toothpaste and have more saliva flow now than I did then. Still have all my teeth whew. Eyes are less dry but still “crusty.” Reducing my other symptoms reduced my stress levels, which reduces inflammation."

"My sensitivities are to food additives, especially gums acids and thickeners and nightshade. It definitely can’t hurt to try. Small differences were noticed with 3 weeks, the 15 symptoms took about 6 months but they’ve stayed gone for the most part the 3.5 years since."

Adding: books put me to sleep. I just got an “allowed”  food list off the internet and only ate those foods.
I do autoimmune paleo and keto it has helped but not cured. My illness has progressed but prob would be worse off if not on this diet. I tried adding dairy back and it was a h to the no 👎
"Yes, Proceed slowly changing just one thing at a time so you give your body time to react and you can judge the effectiveness."
"Keto and then transitioning to KetoCarnivore or Carnivore Diet helped,me tremendously my inflammatory markers are so very low, and helped me manage my 3AIs (Sjogren's, Lupus, and RA) wmfor several years. I just started Plaquenil, to cope with joint pain, swelling, and stiffness along with some other symptoms that I cannot manage simply with diet. While Keto and now CarnivoreDiet won't cure these AIs, my Rheumotologist and PCP (who suggested keto) both agree that I should maintain the CarnivoreDiet since it works very well for me."
Thank you :)

"I think this will be a challenge for me, but I'm going to try it :) I think after the first week, it will be easier to do (hopefully)."
Thank you so much!! I think I will give it a try :)

"Did you just jump right in, or omit things from your diet bit by bit?"
Thank you :) I'm going to research the components of those diets this weekend and give it a try :)
Excellent advice :) thank you very much-- I appreciate it :)
"I watched this ted talk called Minding Your Mitochondria. It’s on YouTube. A doctor, Terry Wahls, did a bunch of research while suffering from MS to the point of choking on her dinner every night in her zero gravity wheelchair, while under the care of the best docs and on the best meds. She discovered MS was “allowed” to exist in her body (along with Parkinson’s and others) due to a shrinkage of the Mitochondria in the brain. She built a diet of micronutrients and foods that reinforce the mitochondria. Within six months she was riding a bicycle!! Lol I was SOLD. but, it’s too much food - like 9 cups of veggies. And I still felt like poop. I was eating bell peppers for my colorful veggie, not knowing nightshade messes me up. Then I tried paleo and felt a little better, then ended up autoimmune paleo and that’s where the magic really happened for me. So, I went “all in” with each of them but really did it bit by bit because each I tried eliminated more lol."
I think one thing we should all get tested for us SIBO and get treated. And then heal the gut. Sibo causes brain issues as well as gut issues. This issue is making sure the gut keeps moving or we get it again and Again. That’s where Tran vagus nerve stim can help not to mention seems to control symptoms like fatigue.
I'm going to check out that Ted talk as well-- thank you very much :)

Also going to look in to autoimmune Paleo. :) Thank you so much for your help :)
"Are you in the US?  Ultimately, you have the ADA to fall back on for all things work protected."

"Explain your diagnosis.  Tell him that your candle has burned at both ends for too long, and you're going to need more accommodations than you have had in the past (as if not working 14 hours is an accommodation?).  Your past work ethic is evidence that you aren't using this as an excuse to slack off. Then, if you get retaliation, you're protected by the ADA."
I spent years trying to power through it. Doesn't work in long run.

My body finally reached the end.  It would do no more.

Had to take months off to heal back up.
"All I can say is good luck. My previous supervisor was also a very close friend—to the point that we spent holidays together—but even she thought I was lying and just trying to slack off during my last flare. After cutting her out of my life and getting a new job, I thought I had found a supportive environment, but as my symptoms stretched on, my previously understanding supervisor ran out of patience. Working with sjogrens is a struggle. But the real problem is finding people who truly understand. It’s easier to just expect people to think you’re lying or lazy and learn to live with that."
There may be someone in

https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/

who can give you some advice.
What is your field of study?

"I am a geologist in the consulting industry and am starting to feel a lot of impact and strain from fieldwork... However I am keeping this from EVERYONE except my partner. I know I am starting to have difficulty fulfilling the job description, which is reason enough to lay me off."


"Secretly, I expect to leave the industry in the next couple years... At least for a hiatus. My partner makes good money and has great health insurance. When we start a family, I want to begin homesteading and embrace control over the energy I DO HAVE. I feel as though a thankless career in consulting isn't worth devoting the physical energy my diseases allow me to have each day."

"However I'd like to stay capable and achieve licensure prior to hiatus, which would enable me to return to work later in life if I choose, provided I maintain credits yearly."
I'm in the UK but I think we have similar legislation.
"You're right, and hopefully there won't be any retaliation. I just need to work up the confidence to go  in and explain it to him. Thanks for the advice, much appreciated 😊"
Sorry you're having these struggles. I find even with good friends there's an element of them them thinking I'm exaggerating. Honestly I wish I was exaggerating and was able to do everything I used to.
"I'm studying climate change impacts in peatlands. I do really like the work but, like you, I'm thinking is it really worth it in the long run when I feel like it's impacting my health?"

"It's great you have the option to take a hiatus but I also understand not wanting to give up work entirely. I feel that, like me, it might be best to keep your employer informed of what's going on. You don't want them thinking you are just slacking off, rather than having a legitimate reason for slowing down."
Here's the link to send him:https://www.sjogrens.org/

"It lists ""profound fatigue."" This is because your body expends a whole lot of energy in attacking and healing itself. That little window also lists the more problematic aspects of the disease."

"It may be helpful to note from a patient perspective that that at it's worse, symptoms and damage are similar to MS combined with lupus, especially if you have autonomic nerve involvement."
"So true. I want to scream at them sometimes, “Trust me, I hate this way more than you do.” This illness forced me to completely reevaluate my life and which dreams and goals are still realistic. I would give anything to go back to the fully capable, burn the candle at both ends overachiever I used to be, but I can’t."
"Also your disability laws will protect you from being fired, but it won’t protect you from people’s opinions about your work ethic or the validity of your illness. Requesting accommodations will likely change your career trajectory and the quality of your work relationships. Be prepared for that."
"""having the option to take a hiatus"" is self invented, as in- I'd have to ""drop out of the work force"" to do so. However, licensure is a perk of being a geologist, once I pass the FG and PG exams I will have a title and a seal. Simply means I can retain value to the industry."

"On paper, you're right to say they should be informed, but in reality I believe being physically incapable to complete the job description is a major fault. Consulting and engineering in America is highly competitive and expectations of achievement are high. I don't think it necessarily matters if this particular firm understands that my health is declining. In generalities I elect to keep them informed, my managers are aware that these diseases exist but I maintain a persona of ""good, fine or dealing with it"". Currently, in truth, my future husband is going to have neurosurgery in a few weeks. My life is focused on having a bit of time off of work for him."
Thanks for the link!
It's good to have something like this to back up what I want to say.
"I understand, it's a really difficult situation and hard to know what to do for the best."
"Best wishes to your future husband for the surgery, hope it all goes well."
"I was diagnosed ANA-positive, Sjogren’s B 2 years ago. I’ve had two ANA tests since and while I still test positive for Sjogren’s, one of my two ANA tests was negative. I’ve been told ANA tests are not that reliable."

"Good luck, whatever you end up doing."
"Sounds like sjogrens to me. I would say the surgery might have triggered an autoimmune response, especially if they blitzed you with some heavy duty antibiotics.  I'm largely asymptomatic now and manage my sjogrens with diet."
"Oddly enough I share the exact same symptoms as you list in the top half of your post (not so much the other ones),and I've also had a septoplasty, and lasic. Dry skin, dry nose, dry throat, I can relate."

"I dont have much advice to offer about whether you do or don't to SS. But I just wanted to chime in about the night-time dry throat, as it was my most uncomfortable symptom. Woke me up every single night for so long, I couldn't get a good night sleep."

"I've been using a dry mouth spray for about 2 years now, and it's made things SO much better.  Three or four sprays right at the back of my throat before bed, then I keep it next to the bed for easy access if needed in my sleep.  Made my life instantly better.  Just a small thing you could try, regardless of whether you get a diagnosis or not. I never knew they existed until I went looking for them, then I found my local Wal-Mart had a good selection."

Good luck and hope you feel better

"Usually when people write posts wondering if they have Sjögren's Syndrome, it's pretty obvious that they likely don't. However, I think that this is worth pursuing in your case. I've noticed that with rheumatologic diseases, the symptoms often begin long before anything shows up in lab work or on xray."

"Frankly, your symptoms remind me of how I was feeling 25 years ago, when I was developing the disease and was about your age."

"I would ask to see a rheumatologist very familiar with Sjögren's Syndrome who can at your visit do a Schirmer's eye test, saliva flow and volume test, and maybe a salivary gland ultrasound. These would provide a good indication of your status, which labs don't show. You may need to seek out a doctor affiliated with a university as they're more likely to have the knowledge as well as the ability to do these tests at your appointment."

"If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up."
Did blood test include SSA/SSB antibodies?
Thanks for the recommendations. Picked up some spray today.
No. Anything related to autoimmune disorders that was tested I listed
"Find a new rheumatologist, if you can! Not being taken seriously is the worst."

"I found that plaquenil really helped my fatigue, but didn't fix it entirely.  I have more energy than I used to, but not as much as I know I had when I was ""healthy""."
"Yes, I'm on plaquenil, 400mg a day. Its helping me a lot with the joint pains but the fatigue hasn't changed much."
"And while I'm happy that the joint pain is clearly much less severe, I'm bummed I'm just as tired as before starting plaq. As you said: it's the fatigue which I can no longer stand..."
"Yes, I started on 200mg a day when first diagnosed and it had some effect. I was told to come off it for a few weeks after 2 years to see if I could get by without it and I had the worst month of my life - serious fatigue, pain, dryness. Now I'm back on it and my dose has increased to 400mg and it improved all symptoms. The fatigue was the main thing that got me when I came off it. I was literally in bed constantly when not at work and even then I was going in late and taking half days as I was just so tired. I found it seriously improved my issues with fatigue especially when I was on the higher dose."
Have taken plaquenil for years for lupus.  Hasn't helped with fatigue.  I started methotrexate a couple of years ago when I was diagnosed with Sjogrens.  That made a big difference in my fatigue.
"I started genetic Plaquenil right after my official diagnosis 6 years ago, helped with my fatigue and my labs started coming back more normal. Sounds like maybe you need to get a new rehumatologist if she doesn't want to address other issues besides pain. Sjogren's has lots of different symptoms that are just as annoying and life affecting as pain. Just my thoughts though, I can't stand doctors who don't take me seriously and have left a few who I thought really didn't listen to me as a person and want to explore other options that might work."
"I was on Plaquenil for the first five years after being diagnosed. It did nothing for me. Last I knew, studies have shown that it does nothing to help those with Sjögren's Syndrome. I now see a rheumatologist that is a researcher and only works with Sjögren's Syndrome patients. She wouldn't even consider prescribing it."
"i’ve been on plaquenil for 7 years. it helps a lot with joint pain and fatigue. i recently took a couple weeks off of it and within a few days i starting having pretty bad joint pain and fatigue again, so i think it really does make a difference."
"if it’s at all possible please consider getting a new rheumatologist. I stuck with a doctor who wasn’t understanding the complaints I gave, but I didn’t want to go through the process and work to find a new doctor and have it happen all over again. I know it sucks but trust me i really regret the amount of time I spent with her. I’m assuming since your doctor is giving plaquenil as an option that you’ve had a lot of blood work done? I find that my fatigue is hella related to vitamin d levels bc I have a deficiency, do you know what your levels are?"
"Plaquenil helped my fatigue tremendously. I'm still fatigued, but I can live normally. No side effects either."
"I’m so sorry to hear that! I used to have insurance that was super strict about referrals too. The easiest way is to get a list of rheumatologists in network in your area and research them online to see if anyone specializes in sjogrens or seems like a good fit. Then when you see your regular doc ask for a referral to that person. You could even ask them for the vitamin d test as well, they would probably do it without an appointment, but that and b12 is super important to get checked if you never have before. I wish you the best!"
"I tried plaquenil, and it did help with the dryness and somewhat with fatigue. But over time the drug made me feel extremely ill, to the point where I wound up in the emergency room feeling like I had been poisoned. Unfortunately I am one of those people who just cannot tolerate this drug."
"I have UCTD-->RA, not Sjogrens, but I've been on Plaquenil for 6 years or so. It has kept my numbers good, but has not helped with joint pain or fatigue."
"I also suffer from chronic migraines which I take medication for on top of having Sjogrens.  Plaquenil caused me more headaches so I took myself off of it.  I canceled my last appointment with my rheumatologist because the appointments are expensive and my health insurance sucks.  Also, Plaquenil is expensive, even the generic brand.  U.S. healthcare sucks.  If money wasn't an issue I would work harder on treating my Sjogrens, but the cost of getting treatment just isn't worth the minimal benefit of relief I have been getting.  :("
"I was prescribed plaquenil but never started it; it comes with a fairly significant risk of retinal damage in the long term, and I don't feel my fatigue is bad enough to take that risk, for myself personally."
What -does- she prescribe? I was under the impression that it didn’t do much for symptoms but it may have a protective effect for organ involvement later in the disease course.
"She isn't giving me any options! She thinks I need a sleep study and to just power through it. I think I need a new rheumatologist but the process is exhausting, I feel like asking if my PSP will help me but she is big into referring out, hopefully she'll refer me to a different rheumatologist."
"Her approach is very conservative as she's found that nothing significantly helps with regard to managing the disease as a whole and instead focuses on treating symptoms instead. If there are complications that warrant a biologic, for instance, she'll elevate care. That said, since she's a Sjögren's Syndrome specialist, she can often determine the patient type and if they're likely a lymphoma candidate or apt to develop organ issues, etc. and individualize treatment. All of her patients get salivary gland ultrasounds in clinic as well as saliva flow and volume testing, etc."

"[This is my doctor](https://youtu.be/MYMQ5Shp2_k) and I highly recommend her, if anyone is located in southcentral Wisconsin."
"You don't mention why you were being tested for SS A/B antibodies, but a positive SS-A  can be found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's and/or other auto-immune diseases.  It alone does not indicate you have a disease - that requires review of clinical symptoms , other laboratory testing  and/or biopsy.  A positive SS-A and negative SS-B is relatively common in these diseases.  Were you also tested for other endpoints: ANA, double strand DNA (dsDNA), anti-Smith (antiSm) , RNP, RF, etc?"
"How is your thyroid,  btw?"
"I went in concerned about thyroid issues. Dr was concerned about autoimmune disease based on my symptoms so she ran some labs. Positive ANA, elevated sed rate, dsDNA ab shows normal, rf shows <10, high total protein, low osmolality calculated, high globulin, low a/g ratio, and vitamin d was on the lower end. Tsh, t4, t3, and tpo all came back normal. Sorry, just found out about the ss-a on my own today even though the labs came back a month ago. I honestly don't know what much of this means. Dr's office hasn't been much help and my February rheumatology appt seems so far away. Any help and advice is appreciated at this point. Thanks!"
Everything checked out fine as far as what they tested.  Depending on symptoms I'll probably ask to have it checked again at a future appointment
"Your elevated ESR would suggest an ongoing inflammatory process, and the positive ANA and SS-A are consistent with, but not proof of an autoimmune process.  Your rheumatologist should be able to put all the information together to come up with potential causes.  Hopefully your symptoms will be manageable until you meet with the doc.  Don't be surprised if the rheumatologist doesn't declare it is disease x or y - formal categorization requires that very specific criteria are met.  That does not mean he/she doesn't think you are sick - just that you don't meet formal criteria at that moment in time.  Good luck!"
"Ok, you have to check your own thyroid tests.  Most docs  just go by the reference range, which is way too wide so has a lot of false negatives if you don't know how to read the test results."

It's wise to read up on thyroid testing and check out your numbers yourself. My son would still be sick if I let his pediatrician have final say. Doctors vary wildly in how they will treat based on tests. Www.thyroidchange.com
"I did a lot of research and went through all my labs on my own. I agree, it's important to be informed and not just take someone else's word for it, doctor or not."
"Here's my results though. Maybe you'll have some insight because I still feel like a thyroid issue makes the most sense with my symptoms. From what I've researched I'm still within ""optimal"" ranges."

Tsh (this has been taken twice) 1.74 & 1.71
T4 free 1.0
T3 total 143
Thyroid peroxidase AB <28

Non-thyroid labs that were abnormal:
ANA-low positive
SS-A-low positive
Vitamin D-34 (low is 30)
Elevated total protein
Elevated globulin
Low A/G ratio


"Reference ranges for the thyroid stuff varies from lab to lab, can you post them? Or message me."
http://imgur.com/gallery/QjzdFZN

Hopefully that works. That's all I have access to as far as the results and reference ranges
"Even the most aggressive doctor won't treat these numbers, but since your doctor has chosen to ask for total T3 rather than Free T3, s/he shows s/he is 20 years out-of-date and I doubt s/he's kept up with the explosion of research that's happened since then. If you're a woman, you might be better off talking to your gyno about thyroid testing. They seem more hip to working to get women to their optimal range. They got tired of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) obstinately dragging their feet on updating protocol in light of newer research, and starting researching themselves on possible problems with the reference range because of its impact on fetuses. I don't really get why it's ok with unpregnant women to be at less than their ideal range, but here we are."

"I've been threatening to write an article on this topic, and seeing that ""total T3"" test kind of has me fired up again, so thanks for that."

"The good news is that these numbers, though not perfectly ideal, aren't much to worry about in themselves. However, if you could arrange to get Free T3 as well as *reverse*T3, as well as TSH and Free T4, it can answer more questions, like, are you converting properly from T4 to T3 (the much more active form of the hormone). You'll likely have to wait a period of time for insurance to pay for more tests, but if you are symptomatic, you should keep looking at your thyroid if only to see whether it's output is swinging up and down or just a little sluggish. Hashimoto's disease, the most common cause of hypothyroidism, is an autoimmune condition and can have periods of varying disease activity. Some Hashi's patients even swing all the way up to hyperthyroidism, so I'm glad he tested to see if your antibodies are okay, which they are."

"Your thyroid can also get thrown off if you are sick or otherwise under physical or emotional stress; this can raise your reverse T3. Or a passing infection can affect your thyroid gland temporarily. At this point, it's better to watch and learn than to jump in with anything drastic, like thyroid supplementation."

"In the meantime, maybe avoid or cook your [crucifers and other goitrogens] (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/goitrogens-in-foods#section3) so they don't inhibit the thyroid processes and be sure to get solid, restorative rest."

"I don't like that your Total T3 is in the bottom half of the range while Free T4 is at the top, but Total T3 is a misleading number because much of that will bound up with protein and inaccessible to conversion to T4. That's why the Free T3 test is preferred."

Could I ask why you thought of thyroid in the first place?
Thanks for all of the info! I'll definitely make sure to look into the tests you suggested when I have future testing done.

Funny story-I went in specifically to talk about my thyroid. Had a whole sheet of symptoms printed out. She agreed to test my thyroid and some additional testing. ANA came back positive and my sed rate was elevated so I was referred to a rheumatologist. Couldn't get in to see the rheumatologist for 3 months so I decided to research my labs on my own. Well I realized she only tested TSH. So I called them and my dr was on vacation so I spoke to a nurse and told her there's more to thyroid testing than TSH so they agreed to have additional thyroid labs done. Then I told them I wanted a thyroid antibody lab done as well since my ANA was positive. The nurse seemed confused and it took awhile to convince her but she finally agreed. Saw the rheumatologist a couple weeks ago and all the inflammation and autoimmune disease labs he ran came back within normal reference ranges so all I know is I have 1:80 low positive ANA with nucleolar pattern and low positive SS-A.

"I've wondered about a thyroid issue for a long time. Some of the main things I've struggled with are fatigue, stubborn weight issues, my normal body temp is generally 96.something, cold hands/feet, irregular periods, digestion issues, and then last year I started having some throat discomfort (not like something was stuck in my throat but more like the front of my neck at the bottom was swollen, sometimes after working out or if my allergies had been acting up, the swollen feeling would be so bad that I was wheezing, other times it was just a noticeable discomfort. I never noticed any actual swelling from the outside), and I started getting little flashes of pain throughout my arms and legs so I decided to go in. I had a great grandma with a thyroid issue, my dad and his dad are both type 1 diabetics, a great aunt with lupus, another great grandma with MS, and a grandpa with menieres disease and gout."

It could be something else totally unrelated to my thyroid but a thyroid issue is what has always made the most sense to me. This week I've had horrible pain and stiffness in my hands and wrists. Never dealt with that before so I called the rheumatologist yesterday and of course he's gone this week so I won't know if he wants me to come in until next week.

You mentioned total t3 and protein. I know my total protein was elevated. Would that have any affect on the total t3?

"Yes, you are wise to keep looking at the thyroid for a while. When it's challenged, you often see changes if you can be vigilant."

"You might try eating a few foods once in a while rich in iodine, like shellfish, and see if you feel any kind of boost. It's really rare that folks in the US suffer from iodine deficiency, but the soil around the Great Lakes is notoriously poor in iodine. For sure use iodized salt or sea salt if you live in that area, though I would not take supplements without testing for low iodine first. Too much can be worse than not enough."
"I've really been digging my Venta humidifier and air washer. Not cheap, but easy to fill, easy to clean (all parts except motor and cord are dishwasher safe on rinse mode) and really no mold risk if you used it properly. Also comes with a long warranty that the company honors without issue and quickly. They come in different sizes based on room size. Other than that, I like my Seneo ultrasonic humidifier which is a more traditional model. Before getting the Venta, I used the Seneo daily but now it's my travel humidifier."
I like my Vornado Evap3 whole room humidifier a lot. I especially like that it doesn't have one of those spouts(?) where the moist air streams out and gets the table damp. This one has a fan and also a decent-sized tank. Highly recommend.
I did some research and I think evaporative humidifiers are best. I think I got a Honeywell one on amazon that works really well. It has a white circular filter you have to pay attention to but it’s waaaay more effective than my old little cone/drop shaped one
Pure Enrichment MistAire Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier. Good cheap option. It just dumps lots of cool mist but needs to be refilled daily.
"Sorry to hear you got another diagnoses and it's Sjogren's. I'm also lupus first then secondary Sjogren's. For me, symptoms from the latter are worse than the former due to really dry eyes and mouth. The saliva med is important for dental health / cavity prevention because saliva has cleansing qualities. It's also important for digestive purposes as saliva contains enzymes to break down food. The saliva also helps with swallowing food and ability to speak. The only negative I've heard a few people complain about is it may cause excessive sweating. There are two meds - Salagen and Evoxac (plus generic versions). If you have side effect from one, be sure to try the other as it may not cause the same side effect."

"I don't know what your lab test results mean, but you might find something enlightening here: https://labtestsonline.org/"

"Other than that, try not to worry as stress exacerbates both lupus and Sjogren's. Easier said than done, but . . . you gotta try."
Thank you for your responses. He didn’t explain what the problem was with not having saliva. I just thought it was dry mouth which I address with water. So....I started the medication this morning. I appreciate everyone’s help.
"I also have structural damage to one of my parotid glands. That one doesn't seem to provide any saliva at all. The medication to produce saliva doesn't work for me, but manual massage on the other one helps a lot."
I'm sorry for what you are going through right now...

"My wife has Lupus (main one it seems, this diagnosis was spotted 6 months ago), Sjogrens and rheumatoid artritis. Some days are extremely hard, everything hurts.. and others are quite normal and she feels OK."

&#x200B;

Stay in touch if you like! I can relay any message you like and reply back (she doesn't speaks english very well).
"You are not alone. I was recently diagnosed with Sjögren’s and my PCP says I have Lupus, but the rheumatologist is taking a “wait and see” approach before he calls it Lupus. My body is also going absolutely haywire. I was hesitant to start taking Evoxac at first, but I looked over the paperwork that came with it and felt that the good outweighed the bad. I tried it, not expecting much. Within an hour I had much more saliva and was starting to have more tears. I didn’t need to apply eye drops every hour. I honestly didn’t know how dry I had been before taking Evoxac, it had been a gradual shift over the years. Sending big hugs, I hope you get the answers you need."
"Yes - every flare.  It was worse before I was diagnosed - I do think that taking lysine daily has helped somewhat.  They are less frequent, less severe, and last longer for the most part."
I use xylitol products and sublingual CBD from Lazarus Naturals.
"I use OTC Kanka to treat, and vitamin b complex daily and toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulfate to prevent or reduce occurrence."
"I am very sensitive to mint toothpastes.  Minty toothpaste makes my mouth, and particularly my tongue, sore to the point of severe difficulty swallowing or even talking.  I use kids toothpaste in fruit flavors.  So far my favorite is Colgate watermelon gel.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is known to cause pain and increase canker sore outbreaks as well.  I don't seem to have a problem with it, just mint stuff, but you may want to check that out.  I also prefer to use kid's fruit mouthwashes vs anything minty (even if it is for dry mouth)."

I also grit my teeth and press my tongue into them when I sleep.  Sometimes I will pinch my tongue between my teeth or rake it along them at night and wake up with the side of my tongue raw.
"Sometimes my mouth gets so dry I develop sores on the sides of my tongue. It really is awful, I am sorry you are going though this. Yes, it hurts to the point where you don't want to talk."
"I wound up going on pilocarpine (Salagen) to produce more saliva, and this has greatly reduced this problem."
"I can’t eat spicy foods: cilantro is too much for my dry mouth to handle. I drink a ton of fluid. Thank helps with most other irritation, but years ago a dentist also recommended a B complex supplement for mouth sores. When I take B complex on a regular basis, I don’t get mouth sores. Hope this helps."
I have geographic tongue from Sjogren’s and it is absolutely aggravated by spicy foods... which I love. I try to avoid when possible.
I’ve been using biotene dry mouth constantly and it seems to be making a difference. It’s hard to tell because I all ready have dentures at a really young age because of this so the temporary ones tend to irritate me a bit.
"I actually suffered from those same symptoms when I first got diagnosed. My primary referred me to a GI specialist, I ended up eliminating gluten and dairy, taking collagen peptides, and omega 3,6,9 supplements to reduce any backing up. My intestines were drying out so it caused stool to get too hard and caused tears that lead to bloody bowel movements."

"Don't stress about it being TMI, I am sure plenty of others have suffered from various unpleasent symptoms too."
"Thankfully my stomach issues aren't as bad as yours but they're still awful. My GP put me on stool softeners & omeprazole which have really helped. Interestingly I told my Rheumatology Consultant about my stomach symptoms & he said that Sjogren's didn't cause them. He then gave me a website to look up, the website said Sjogren's did cause digestive problems."
[deleted]
"My original symptoms also included stomach issues and diarrhea. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything else, but you are definitely ""normal"" in this aspect."
"I used to get something similar, but instead of blood, it was agonizing diarrhea. And sometimes a little bit of fresh blood. This went on for years."

&#x200B;

"Last year I started taking digestive enzymes, and it has totally changed my life. Not saying this can help for you or people with similar problems, but damn, after years of suffering, the first month of taking digestive enzymes it felt like I had a brand new insides.."

&#x200B;

"I talked to my doc, and he was skeptical, so he had me stop taking the enzymes for a month to check my pancreas levels. It took a couple weeks, and all the symptom came back, but not as hellish as before. But when we did the tests, it wasn't bad enough to need prescription enzymes, but he said continue using vitamin store digestive enzymes if I felt they helped."

&#x200B;

"I've tried a few brands, and found one that works best for me. I can eat regular food now, and after years of hellish painful explosive diarrhea, I have normal average stools. And I now have more energy, I'm guessing because I'm actually digesting and absorbing my food instead of quickly passing it through."
Did your GI's advice stop your bleeding?
"My rheumy assured me in my first appt that this was ""normal"" for Sjogren's and that Sjogren's can often be accompanied by ulcerative colitis. So now I need yet another colonoscopy."
"Yes, and after a couple follow ups he was happy that everything was staying regulated without needing medications."
Did he say that you have Celiac disease? Or NCGS?
"We never got to the biopsy testing for anything, due to the inflammation and bleeding stopping once I changed my diet. I am positive for Sjogren's however."
"Gotcha, interesting history, and I'm so glad you were able to find some relief. Thanks for sharing <3"
"I didn't get a lip biopsy, only a blood test. The rheumatologist made his diagnosis from that & my symptoms."

"Go back to the ophthalmologist & ask for different drops, preferably ones without preservatives. My ophthalmologist says they can dry your eyes out even more."
"I also was not diagnosed based on lip biopsy OR eyes. I was diagnosed by blood, and have all of the symptoms that make me pretty clearly a Sjogren's patient (anemia, heartburn, nausea, skin stuff, dry eye, joint pain). I'm not a doctor, but I don't think, at least nowadays, that that is required."
"No. Lip biopsies are not definitive. I can say this with bit confidence because I've recently gone to the otolaryngologist to try to get a lip biopsy just to find out it isn't a gold standard test for Sjogren's. The otolaryngologist said that unless I'm having a flare up now or had one recently there is a high likelihood that the results of the biopsy might come back 'normal' but that wouldn't mean that I don't have Sjogren's (as I am positive for SSA antibody/blood test). I do suffer from dry eyes and dry mouth (I have gone to optomologist and dentist to confirm) but doctor mentioned that if I have the disease that I am a very mild case of it, which is why he wanted to advise me against a biopsy."

"The eye test you mentioned is called Schimer's test, which I also had done. I've done some research before and after the test and every literature I've seen reported poor accuracy of Schimer's test. I went to a optomologist after and he told me that to any well trained optomologist would be able to see I have dry eyes from looking at them. I mentioned my Schirmer's results and asked him how accurate he thinks it was and he told me ""well let's put it this way, I haven't done Schirmer's in at least 6 years."""

"Saying all that, I personally would of done the lip biopsy six or seven month ago because the symptoms were pretty bad back then. My condition has improved from early this year due to rhematologist putting me on med called  Hydroxychloroquine and most importantly I've gotten a laparoscopic removal and diagnosis of endometriosis, which so far all of the doctors seem to agree that endometriosis would of exacerbated symptoms of Sjogren's."

"Anyway, sorry I did go off topic with endometriosis but I hope this helped with your little curiosity :)"

Wife uses Refresh Tears during the day and Refresh Liquigel for night time. But you have to put in the teas first as the gel is more oily and is used to trap the liquid moreso.  Lip balm she likes Mentholatum. Aveeno baby nonscented lotion for skin after shower. And drink boat loads of water.
"I use systane ultra for eyes, no prescription eye treatment yet. for hands just normal neutrogena hand cream. my nasal cavity and throat are the worst parts of my dryness and the nasal sprays don't really work. i should probably have a humidifier at work but it doesn't bother me enough so i don't. there are these new ear drops in santa barbara, i forget the name of them but i really do want to try them for (ETD) Eustachian Tube Dysfunction."
"Get a humidifier and use oils. Argan oil is the best for face, hair, nails, body. I only wash my face with an oil cleanser as well. Farmacy Green Clean (Sephora) or Pond’s Cold Cream."
Which symptoms? U may need to play with brands to get the right treatment. I have lip stuff that helps and lip stuff that doesn't do shit. Eye drops that work when others haven't.
So it does really help her and make a difference in her quality of life rather than just mask the symptoms?
"It's a long game until there is some sort of definite cure. As I know it thus far everyone is different in terms of what part of the body is symptomatically impacted. She has a list of issues that come and go some of which might stay longer than others. Arthritis in different joints, lung pain, migraines, headaches, skin rash and possibly related but unsure is indigestion and gallbladder problem with fats."

"All products we use are to treat symptoms to lessen the effects of the disease. What I listed before are the products she would use daily. There are others like ice packs, xylitol for salivary gland stimulation, some wrist braces and yea days where she's just really exhausted with fatigue.  Currently she's on one immunosuppressant, one nsaid, one stomach acid reducer and birth control. The NSAID is the only one where it is taken to treat ""symptom"" of arthritis when it gets too severe preventing motion of joints."

Tldr: it masks symptoms to improve quality of life
I took it for a while. It made my hair thin and I disliked having to go to the opthalmologist every six months and the random shortages when manufacturers had no idea who was making what. For the last year that I used it I was paying generic prices but the pharmacy was giving me the name brand!

"When the study was released that said it was no better for Sjogren's than placebo, I quit. I noticed nothing when I quit. I actually feel like I have fewer flares now I'm off."

"Thing is, there was never anything but anecdotal evidence that it worked for Sjogren's. And because it ""takes six months before you notice any changes"" it's easy for doctors to think they're doing something when there's nothing they can do. It sort of became the standard of care for absolutely no reason."

"And my hair never really grew back after, either. I'm bitter about that."
"While I did notice a slight lessening in aches and fatigue, the headaches and stomach issues weren’t worth it."
"I’m surprised by the number of people having issues with plaquenil. For me, I’m not sure how far advanced my disease would be without it. I’ve been taking it since my diagnosis in 3/2010, at age 21. My initial symptoms were pretty significant hair thinning and a weird, moderately-sized hypopigmented lesion on my left inner shin. I never had the “typical” symptoms of dry eyes and mouth (they initially grouped me under “collagen vascular disease”). I got started off at 400mg daily, and after some time it significantly improved/returned hair growth and the skin lesion virtually disappeared. I was doing so well that eventually my daily dose was decreased to 200mg daily, which I still take today. Fortunately, my labs to this day have been normal. I would say I’ve been very lucky to remain so stable. Over the past few years, I started experiencing some dry eyes (but not before a corneal ulcer/scar, yay!), occasional mild dry mouth, and intermittent salivary gland pain and swelling. But I honestly believe it’s just the nature of disease course after so many years having those pesky autoantibodies, plus I notice these issues more if I’m dehydrated, eating poorly, etc. Two years ago I moved to another state and switched rheumatologists. My first follow up visit he did say I likely have Primary Sjogren’s (seemed almost fascinated by that lol), but that my body right now is very susceptible to progressing into lupus. He used the term “pre-lupus,” which caused me to have a secret inner freak-out sitting in the room. He closely followed that by saying not to worry because I’m on plaquenil, and that although I’m “pre-lupus,” plaquenil is the “machine gun to protect me.” I will never forget that... simple words but they clicked. Also, I should mention that I have never had ANY issues or side effects while taking it, even on the higher dose. Plaquenil is a cool little drug that works as immunomodulator. Basically, if it works for your particular body, disease activity, and symptoms, and your doc recommends at least a trial, just take it. If it doesn’t work, keep exploring.... Now, when is my retinal screening due again? 🤔😉"
31 male checking in. Officially diagnosed for 6 months now. Puzzled for years before the diagnosis.

"Plaquenil helps a lot with my joint pain. Without it, my fingers get suuuuuuuuuuper swollen and it's painful to walk. With it, I still get swollen but it's not as intense and usually just worse in the morning. Also, I haven't had much parotid gland swelling since I started using Plaquenil, and I can now run 10 km without wheezing. Before I'd start wheezing terribly after 5 km. Also, I haven't had a fatigue attack since I started, but I've also regulated my exertion more carefully after my last fatigue scare."

"Side effects, hmm.. I had headaches for a while but I'm okay now. I don't have any GI issues, it seems, but my GI tract is a bit random in how it decides to behave so I have good and bad days."

"For what it's worth, I still get random symptoms like migratory joint swelling, temporary nerve pain, and heart palpitations. It's hard to say whether these things are the drug or just the systemic nature of the disease, but I suspect it's the latter. Plaquenil hasn't been a cure-all, but I'd rather live with it than without it for now."

Good luck!
"Plaquenil did nothing to help me, though my case is rather severe. SS progressed quite a bit while on it. I also developed hyperpigmentation, both on my arms and legs. Some of it went away after discontinuing the medication, but not all."

"Have there yet been any studies that have proven it effective? Last I knew, there weren't."
"Was dx'd with Lupus in 1989, and shortly thereafter dx'd with Sjogren's and Raynaud's Syndrome. I've been taking Plaquenil since my initial diagnosis, and while I can't tell how much it does or doesn't help with joint pain (I also take anti-inflammatories, beginning with Feldene at time of dx and now Etodolac), I \*do\* know that during a time when I had no health insurance and couldn't afford my medications, I stopped taking Plaquenil for almost a year. I eventually ended up in the ER with what turned out to be a small stroke (and a further dx of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome). My rheumatologist (whom I hadn't seen since my insurance had expired chastised me over the phone while I was the the ER (the doctor on duty had phoned him for my history) for not taking my Plaquenil, and that I should've contacted him for samples or some arrangement when I couldn't afford my pills....   So, anyway, I'm still taking 400mg of Plaquenil per day now in 2018, and it doesn't alleviate every single symptom (I'm still on anti-inflammatories and sometimes pain medication), but apparently there can be even more severe consequences by \*not\* taking it....?"
"I have primary Sjogrens and was given plaquenil just over a year ago. It took some time to kick in, expectedly, and it did start to make a difference to the pain."

However after about 4-5 months I started having horrific nightmares and thoughts - eg setting fire to people 😧

So I stopped taking it. I’m back to rheumatologist again today to see what else I can try as I’m struggling. (I moved countries in the meantime hence the delay).

"But it does work for a lot of people, so don’t write it off, that was just my experience :-)"
"I just came off of it because my rhuemy said it really doesn’t help Sjögren’s. He cited some new study.I have also been told for the past 6 years that I have Lupus, now the new doc says no, primary Sjögren’s. I’m confused and scared. I have been taking Infusions of Rituxan due to my symptoms being so bad. I have extremely swollen parotid glands, skin rashes, fevers and gastroparesis from neuropathy. I just worry that things will get even worse. 😞"
It is the best for sleeplessness too.
"Honestly, I've found marijuana is the most helpful for my symptoms. Marijuana, a warm bath/soak, and lots of water. I don't know why but it really calms the pain and the fatigue most days."
"Take a deep breath & try to relax. You need to phone your gp for an appointment to discuss your concerns. No more Google, I do it too, usually at 2am & frighten myself into insomnia."
"Thirty-two years and dealing with Sjögren’s, my husband has no problem making me comfortable. He sees it as a feather in his cap. The right man will be all about you. As for the blood clots, yeah, had one after major surgery. Deal with what happens as it happens. That’s living. Smooth out, honey. You’re an incredible soul. There is no one like you. No one else can live the amazing life you are living, Sjögren’s or not. Own your life. You got this, and I’m proud of you."
"DrFremulon,"

"I had a pulmonary embolism in 2004. Of course, I almost died. The cause was determined to be due to birth control pills. I was in the hospital for 8 days. I'm no longer ever able to take birth control pills."

Getting off the pill will help save your life. There are medications you can take that will help ensure you don't have a blood clot. The doctors will help take care of you.

"Fear is natural and I've been afraid too. One of the things I do to help combat the fear, especially of blood clots is to take 1 aspirin. Of course, you need to check to see if you can take aspirin, but it's an anticoagulant."
"Make an appointment with your gynecologist to discuss this.  You also might try reading [here](https://www.stoptheclot.org/about-clots/webinar_contra/birth_control_clots/).  Regarding vaginal dryness, you really just need to get some lube.  I prefer coconut oil, but then I've been married for a while and we're not using condoms (oil-based lubricants break down latex).  There are a ton of good lubes out there, and again this is a question you can ask your gynecologist."

"There are ways of making lubrication sexy ( I know it doesn't feel like it).  If you don't feel comfortable discussing it to your partner you can pop into the restroom and ""prepare"" yourself with it and then just keep it on hand if you need more during sex. Or, if you get more comfortable with your partner he can apply it for you during foreplay.  I promise you that if a partner is skeeved out by the fact that you need it then they're not work the cost in lube in the first place."
"Hi,"

"There are a number of birth control options available to you if you are prone to blood clots.  You can do an IUD or the mini pill and both are fairly effective. If you find the right guy, he will be willing to wear his own protection. There are many lubes out on the market. Sorry you've been experiencing this."

You may want to see a hematologist about going on a blood thinner to put your mind at ease.
My daughter was born with 3 ventricular septal defects and an bicuspid aortal valve. She also has Marfan's syndrome and had Pectus Carinatum (pigeon chest) that was corrected with surgery. I have no idea if any of this is related to my Sjogren's but I'd like to know.
I have another autoimmune disease so was tested for the ssa-a and ssa-b as part of the round of “other” stuff they look for if you get pregnant. I ended up being positive for both. I was monitored closely by my mfm doctor. He had extra ultrasounds done by a cardiologist from weeks 27-32 or so to watch for the heart block. It’s something they do over time so the weekly appointments are necessary. My daughter ended up fine in that respect but ended up with a Neonatal Lupus diagnosis at 10 weeks (and hydrocephalus as a result of that). It was a roller coaster that resolved itself between 4-6 mo.

https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/neonatal-lupus/
"I was diagnosed with pSS just a few months ago, and want to plan a pregnancy,  no idea what I'm in for with SS, this article helps, thank you"
My baby developed heart block at 26 weeks in utero.  It ended up being third degree (complete).  She made it to 37 weeks where we did a planned cesarean.  She had a pacemaker put in at 4 days old and spent a month in the cardiac icu.  She’s 16 months now.
Very interesting. I have a first degree atrioventricular block.
"Oh, wow. I'm so glad she's okay now. So, neonatal lupus resolves itself post-partem?"
Best of luck to you!
"My son didn't have heart block, but he had three ventricular septal defects and an off-center atrial valve. I have no idea whether that's related to SS. My husband's mom had a bit of a pigeon chest which can go along with some of the things my son dealt with, like pectus carinatum (corrected by surgery when he was 15). The VSDs healed faster than they thought they would and he was at 99% height and weight growing up, so he's great."


"I'm glad you're little one is still with you, I hope s/he's doing well."
How is your mom?

Yup! It takes 4-6 mo for the antibodies to leave the baby’s body and then they’re basically normal. She’s got sensitive skin but I’m not sure if that’s related or just how it is. Her dad’s skin is sensitive too.
That’s great.  That must’ve been scary to deal with.
I am so grateful for modern medicine. I have lupus and sjogrens  (both ss/a and ss/b) and they are sure that’s what’s caused it in my daughter.  Now I’m afraid to have another kid.  :(
"She has dry eye, but no formal Sjogren's diagnosis."
"You're right to be afraid and not just for the health of your future kids. I got so much sicker with my third pregnancy and never recovered; haven't been able to work in 20 years. I had undiagnosed celiac disease, thyroid disease and Sjogren's at the time (only early antibodies)."
"I'm glad your daughter is okay! Can I ask how she's doing? Like is she expected to have a more or less normal childhood/life? I'm in my late 20s now, debating on whether or not I should have a family."

"Also I hate to be a downer, but when my rheumatologist spoke with me about this, she said that if you have a baby with heart block, any subsequent children have a much much higher risk :("
Her development is totally normal.  Besides the heartblock she didn’t have any other issues except low birth weight.  She’s since caught up to the normal growth curve.  They treat her like a normal 18 month old except for the fact that we go to the cardiologist every couple of months.  We’re anticipating the need to replace her pacemaker battery sometime in the next year.  The only downside is repeated replacement surgeries throughout her life.

My rheumy didn’t recommend us having kids since I have lupus and the antibodies.  If we did there’d be a low chance of this happening. And now that it happened it increases the chances of it happening again :(!  It sucks cause we really wanted to have two kids.

Totally a personal decision.  We were torn and felt selfish for bringing in a child knowing this could happen.  And devastated when we found out we became the <1% statistic.  But our little one is the best thing that has happened to us.  Best of luck to you!

"It’s frustrating when you have allergies, I totally get it. What about coconut oil? That might help. For skin serum, I use squaline oil and sometimes rose oil. See Biossance products."
"My husband had the worst dry skin I had ever seen due to an extremely rare cancer. He was prescribed Eucerin. I took to using it also, bc he got a new, large tub prescribe every time he went into the hospital. It was prescribed by his dr. team at HUP."
I like jojoba oil for face moisturizer when I don't need sun protection; Olay with SPF when I do. Cetaphil moisturizing cream is good for body.
"https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Psoriasis-Moisturizing-Salicylic-Protective/dp/B075N8392D. I use it on my face too, keeps it better hydrated than anything else I’ve found."
Primary Sjogrens here also taking Plaquenil and cymbalta.

"I use Palmers Cocoa butter and pure Vitamin E oil. Organic coconut oil works well but my pets won't stop licking me if I use it,  so I don't too much."
"I use aloe vera (like the stuff you put on after a sunburn) quite a bit. It has a little bit of alcohol in it so the excess product dries off faster, but I really enjoy the cooling effect and it has helped a ton with the dry flaky skin."

"I also use very simple moisturizer - I really like CeraVe for how light and deeply moisturizing it is (doesn't feel like it's clogging pores), but I use Cetaphil or Simple brand if I can't find CeraVe."
"I like Nuetrogena's Hydro Boost products. Have been great for my face and making my makeup look decent. Also, sink care products with ceramides are pretty good."
I’m using Xiidra which is a prescription. It is a lifesaver for me.
I was recently prescribed both Restasis and Freshkote (latter available OTC as well) and have seen decent results so far.
"Restasis didn't work well enough for me so I got punctal plugs - all four puncta plugged, which has made a world of difference. No longer any need for prescription eye drops and reduced the amount of OTC eye drops I use."
OTC eyedrops contain preservatives. After a while your body will become allergic to these preservatives and create *more* inflammation. Fuck that shit. Get unidose prescription drops.

And while you're at it:

*- get prescripion eye gel. Lasts longer than drops.

"*- Restasis/Cyclosporin (this will burn like hell for the first few weeks or months,though)"

*- Punctum plugs

*-heat pads

*-Wrap-around sunglasses

"*-Avoid wind, air-conditioning, smoke, anything that will dry out your eyes"

*-Eat lots of healthy oils

Good luck! pm me if you need anything
I really notoved a difference when I started using restasis as well as when I have stopped using them regularly. They turn into sand..
"I use SUltra Preservative Free.  I like it. If using over the counter, make sure it's preservative free indicates on label. Also make sure to include a triple strength fish oil supplement."
Restasis amd Systane balance works for me
"I get this stuff, [HycoSan](http://www.scopeophthalmics.com/hycosan/hycosan-extra) online, it ships from the U.K. to the U.S. I really like it because it gently shoots a dose into the eye without my hand shakily waiting for a drop to maybe hit my eyeball. All I do is aim it at my eye and compress the bottle/applicator. It doesn't suck any air back in so you don't have as much possible bacterial contamination. And they work great."
Thanks
Thanks
Some people do really well sleeping with goggles if you want to add it to the list.

"There are a lot of OTC preservative-free eyedrops. The Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation sent me the ones from Thera Tears, which I really like. A gel product will definitely last longer though. :)"
thanks
"I'm so sorry to hear you are suffering.   I was diagnosed a year ago at age 54.  I am on plaquenil  2x day and it helped with my salivary gland pain.  Pretty much went away, so I guess I am ""lucky""."
"However, my eyes are getting much more irritated now.  Usually, the next level of medication my RH suggested was Methotrexate.  However, it is a much, much stronger immunosuppresant, and some potentially serious side effects.   Having an autoimmune disease just sucks, and I can understand your frustration!  As I am learning, getting to the right level of treatment regimen is not a straight line, as every patient is different, and you may run into some roadblocks along the way.  I would call your RH and see if they can put you on a ""cancellation list"".   Some drs do that, so if a patient cancels an appointment, they will slot someone in there.   CHeck out https://www.sjogrensworld.org/  they have a forum for discussions.  Please keep us posted here, and hoping you get some relief."
Sorry to hear you got plaquenil toxicity. I got it after 4.5 years of using the med and had to stop taking it immediately. Definitely disappointing and frustrating.

"I agree with /u/nobody102 about seeing if you can get on your doctor's cancellation list. If there's no list, call often to see if there are any cancellations so you can take the appointment. By doing this, I have been able to get appointments move up by weeks and months. I find calling a half hour to an hour after the office opens or closes to be the best times as people tend to cancel first thing in the morning for that day or late afternoon for the next day."

"In the meantime, if your salivary glands still hurt you might want to try massaging them and see if that helps. https://www.google.com/search?q=salivary+gland+masage&oq=salivary+gland+masage&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7935j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"

You might ask your pcp if they feel comfortable prescribing an NSAID. Not a long term solution but can help with some of the pain while you’re waiting for the rheumatologist. Celebrex and relafen worked well for me.

I did a lot of research about plaquenil and I agree with others that it’s highly abnormal to have changes this fast. You may seek a second opinion!


"Go ahead and make the appointment however long it takes. You're going to still be around, you'll still have Sjogren's; it might be good to have the option to see that doctor at that time.  If you decide against it, cancel it a week out; they'll fill it."
"200 MG twice daily. My eye dr said it must have been something else causing the maculopathy because plaquenil takes like, decades. I dont really know if anything else causes it though. Thinking about getting a second opinion"

"I was just in to get the retinal spectography before starting Plaquenil. The teeny variation on my image where the doctor could see ""corneal wrinkling"" was very subtle. The new doc who was, apparently, training or a resident, or whatever they call it, did not note the wrinkling, told me everything was fine."


"What I'm saying is, some people are better at divining the meaning of an medical image."
Thank you for reaching out for advice for your mom. There are a few things she can try with and without the help of a doctor:

"1. Biotene products. They have a range of products that help with mouth dryness. Toothpaste, mouth rinse, gel, etc."

"2. Try to brush teeth multiple times a day. My teeth decayed fast before I was diagnosed with Sjogrens. Because of the dryness, the teeth aren’t protected well and get cavities more easily. Make sure to brush and floss regularly and brush after meals."

"3. Be gentle with the mouth. Some foods that are more acidic hurt my mouth. Tomatoes, berries, lemons, sodas, alcohols, etc. I can handle them in small amounts but if I have too much, it can hurt."

4. Get a prescription mouth wash. There are a variety of prescriptions for mouth washes that can help with pain and mouth ulcers. A dentist can even prescribe one.

5. Water. I always have water with me at all times in my purse. My mouth can get super dry and I need to have a sip here and there.

6. Gum. Get a gum with xylitol. Keep gym with you at all times. It helps stimulate saliva.

7. Eye drops. Find a good eye drop brand and make sure to use it multiple times a day. You can also find thicker drops/gel that you can use at night.

8. Warm compress. Putting a warm compress on my eyes for 10-15 minutes helps to stimulate tears and unblock the glands.

9. Lid scrubs. You can buy a special product that helps to scrub your eyelids and lash lines. I try to use these 1-2 times a  week and it helps to keep the eyelids clean and open glands. You can find them at any pharmacy. They come in a pack with individual cleaning wipes.

10. Restasis. This is a prescription eye drop that you take twice a day and it helps increase tear production. There’s no generic and it’s expensive but you can get a prescription discount card to help cut down on cost. I’ve tried this in the past and it helped but it also stung my eyes every time.

11. Eye punctal plugs. You can have your tear ducts blocked off temporarily or permanently which helps keep the tears/water on the eyes for longer. This can be done by an ophthalmologist.

I hope these suggestions help!
What are your mom's symptoms?
"Is she seeing a rheumatologist? What tests were run to determine Sjogren's?   If she gets try mouth, look at the product Biotene rinse.  You can also get prescription eye drops to help with the dryness.  Best of luck to your mom."
"10 .  Outside of the USA there is a generic version called cyclosporine. I've found that the stinging recedes after 2-3 months, ymmv."
Keeping Restasis in the refrigerator can also help reduce or eliminate stinging.
"Yes, thanks to the ketogenic diet and methyl-B12 supplements."
"I do both, still have deep fatigue. On keto, my brain fog is a lot less, though."
"Man, I have to go back to low carb. I'm just too fucking tired to cook when I'm hungry. I'm rarely hungry, but when I am, I'm weak and starving. I'm so fucking sick of this shit. Now that I'm also histamine intolerant I can't eat  1/3 of the things I'm used to eating on a paleo diet. I also have celiac disease, so all my ready-to-eat options are gluten-free bread which is pretty much devoid of nutrition and fiber. Heh. This is how bad my brain fog is. I just now realized that I am replying to myself. Fuck me running."
I'm also primary Sjögren's although I do have hashimoto hypothyroidism and celiac.  My thyroid is corrected and when I'm not having Sjögren's flares I'm feeling good so I think thyroid is properly corrected.

"For me Sjögren's has been dry eyes and a bit of dry mouth, brain fog and generalized muscle and joint soreness.  At one point a couple years ago, I was at a breaking point where I was just so tired of being uncomfortable and exhausted that I felt myself losing hope for life."

I take plaquinil and restasis however of the things that has been huge for me: magnesium and curcumin. Particularly the magnesium when it comes with the muscle and joint.

I also religiously take fish oil and vitamin D.

"Over time of taking the mag, curcumin, vitamin D and fish oil, I have REALLY turned around.  I had been on plaquinil for a year before I really got on top of taking the other stuff.  Last year I stopped taking the magnesium and after a month I was soooo uncomfortable again."

There are members of the [Sjogren's World forums](http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?board=1.0) that use Cellcept (or have in the past). They can likely give you more information if you search the threads for Cellcept (if you haven't already).

"As others have mentioned, Plaquenil is generally the first line systemic medication due to its lower risk of side effects. Cellcept is a more serious drug, though it seems to be falling out in favor of biologics like Rituxan and Orencia (currently in phase 3 trials for SS approval). Because there are no systemic treatments that have been approved for SS, anything that you may take will be off-label."

"I have personally found the best relief from alternate therapies, including low-dose Naltrexone, helminthic therapy, and various vitamins and supplements. I've documented [my treatment regimen](http://www.whatyousjo.com/treatments/my-treatment-regimen/) on my [personal blog](http://www.whatyousjo.com/) if you are interested."
Can I ask the dosage amounts of magnesium and curcumin you recommend?
Thank you everyone for your responses. I will hopefully get a good system of doctors and care going soon and will get some relief..even a little would help.

Thank you! I had actually just found your blog a few days ago. I have an appt with a new rheumatologist next week who I read has done SS research and I hope to put a better plan in place. I’m not having any bad reactions to the Cellcept but no good either and I just don’t really want to be on it. I kinda think its aging my face... but that’s probably the stress.
"I had H. pylori when I first got Sjogren's symptoms. Subsequently, I've gone through triple-therapy (two antibiotics and a proton-pump inhibitor) to clear the infection, but my Sjogren's symptoms remain."

"Since I've locked down my diet (autoimmune paleo, AKA AIP) I don't have any more GI pain. You might want to try the AIP - I have found it profoundly helpful."
I'm writing a story about h. pylori and I'm looking to interview a woman between 45 and 60 who had fatigue and was diagnosed with an asymptomatic h. pylori infection which also caused iron-deficiency anemia. I'm on a fast deadline. Know anyone?
"I had an ulcer, so tested pos. for H.Pylori and was treated. I almost finished my course, but not quite. No more stomach symptoms, but I did go on to get diagnosed with celiac disease."

"I try to stay AIP, it does make a difference for me, but most non-AIP foods I can't tolerate anyway. I already don't do gluten because of celiac disease. I have SIBO, so grains and starch are easy to avoid, I'm allergic or intolerant to corn, eggs, dairy, beef, pork. AIP is pretty much my default since I've always tried to support organic farming by eating organic whenever possible. j"

My one issue with all this AIP talk is that celiac sufferers on AIP may never get diagnosed. I feel strongly that anyone with digestive problems as well as autoimmune issues should get the blood test for celiac disease before going gluten-free.
She did take the antibiotics when she got diagnosed. She was so sick she could barely move by the end of the day.  We are still waiting to see if the treatment worked though.

Are you permanently on that diet?  This stomach issue seems to be so different from person to person. As to what food sets off the pain.
Ditto on AIP. Found out I was allergic to 5 different foods on it. Feel better on AIP than on any other plan I’ve ever tried.
Those are some very specific criteria.
"Nope sorry, my wife isn't in that age range"
"Yes, the antibiotic regimen was insanely difficult for me, too. It was the the hardest medical procedure on my body I've ever had, and I've had a few invasive procedures. Towards the end, it felt like how cancer patients describe chemo, though I am sure it is not nearly as bad. If she did the full regimen, I am confident she will no longer have *H. pylori*, but don't expect this to do anything for her symptoms, because it won't."

"Everyone with autoimmunity should permanently be on the autoimmune paleo diet. I have tried numerous times to slowly introduce AIP-illegal foods, and without fail, they end up hurting me somehow - be it through stomach pain, worsening autoimmune symptoms, insomnia, brain fog, fatigue, etc. I am much, much better when I just adhere to the diet, and I really encourage other patients to at least give it a try for a month. You've got to let your body heal from the chronic exposure to common irritants, like gluten, dairy, etc., before you will start to see huge improvements. You can expect to see smaller but significant changes even within days."

The stomach issues are probably not very different person to person. Typically there are a few foods that almost nobody will tolerate. What can't she eat?

"By the way,  I just want to add, it does suck to have a restricted diet, but what if somebody stabbed you in the gut every time you ate ice cream? It wouldn't take more than one or two stabbings before you just realized it wasn't worth it any more. I think that's how a lot of patients on the AIP feel about their food sensitivities."
"Organic, virgin coconut oil. It is incredibly good, doesn't mess with your pH, and it's a great lube as well. That's all I use."
There are vaginal moisturizers that last for a few days and can also be used as lube.
I really like Swiss Navy lube.
"Thanks! As a lube though, isn’t coconut oil not compatible with condoms?"
It's only incompatible with latex. I'd suggest you use polyurethane condoms
"Not sure. My husband got a vasectomy, so we don't use protection. Sorry."
Pelvic floor physical therapy has helped a lot with my constipation
Probiotics!
"I have cut down an all grains, fewer problems"
My doc recommended MiraLAX and Benefiber.  I use them once a day as needed.
Thank you for the tips!
I take 1/4 capfull of miralax and citrucel fiber every day
Magnesium glycinate supplements daily. Dr.'s Best and Kal are two good brands.
Thank you!!
Probiotics and two ounces of aloe water daily. The aloe water is a miracle!!!
"I make my own kombucha now. It even seems to help with joint issues, but I'm kind of testing that theory."
"Same here. We've been overboard on gluten-free bread (etc.) around here since we came down with this weird flu-like thing, (too weak and tired to cook or even shop) but I feel like hell and my digestion is an unpredictable event. I am *so* much better when on a fairly low carb diet, say 100-150 grams daily. It's not full-blown keto, but you slip into ketosis at night; that's good for your brain and seems to even out my dizziness and cognitive suppression."
"Step 1. Do not use chapstick. I find it only helps for a short period of time. I stead use Vaseline lip therapy. It's sticky and gooey but it's the only one that works long term and it doesn't create an addiction (yes, chapstick does that) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H8BNEFW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_rHeYzbB43X219"
Most of my symptoms only show up near and around menses so I can relate with that... even though my doctor says its not related.. thats debatable. My body says otherwise and so do many that have answered my questions as far as linking symptoms with menstrual cycle.
Around your period estrogen levels can spike AD's. Look up estrogen and autoimmune flares and that will explain a lot. So can being on a high dose birth control method.

I get this. I use a cream called 'desonide' ointment and it works so well! I think it is basically diaper rash cream. I have used it for years.
Yes I’ve experienced this! Does the whiteish part on your lips itch and burn and look puffy?
Thank you! I switched to lip therapy and my lips are 80% better 24 hours later. I appreciate the tip!
"Mine is always way worse due to my cycle, too. I hate when Doctors discredit symptoms that are consistently linked and possible correlations! We know our bodies better than anyone and if we say symptoms are consistently worse, then there has to be some connection even if the doctors can't easily explain it."
"I couldn't find it, what section is it in?"
Yay! Happy it helped!
"I'm so sorry, it's a prescription! It's a steroid. But it's cheap. I think A&D ointment over the counter is similar. But if you have a good doc, ask for it. It's amazing."
"I've had what was labeled as neuropathic nausea for six months straight.  It was with me 24/7.  It just appeared out if the blue.  It was a moderate nausea that wasn't relieved by any medications and I never threw up.   Oddly, eating food that wasn't good for me didn't make it worse.  It was always at the same level.  I had to force myself to eat, which was the hardest part of it all.  It went away as abruptly as it came on.  A year later I had burning mouth syndrome for 6 months solid too.  I couldn't drink hot coffee or eat spicy foods.  I never heard of either condition prior to experiencing them.   They were both believed to be caused by a problem with the vagus nerve.  Dizziness is pretty much a standard thing for me, but I'm used to it.  Dizziness seems to be common in Sjogren's patients with neurological involvement."
"Yes to both. It is terrible. I really struggle with 'nausea flares' where I will have terrible nausea for 2 months straight, then it goes away. Same with the dizziness. Haven't brought it up to my doc yet as I just got a new doc (insurance is such a pain....) Ask for Zofran. It helps."
"This was the main thing that made me see a doctor to begin with, nausea in the am, random nausea in the evening. My SSA AND SSB are as high as labcorp will test, but my doc has diagnosed Lupus because of physical symptoms, sun rash, hair falling out, aching joints, etc. but she says my nausea isnt related, I dont have typical sjrogrens symtoms besides gritty sand feeling in my eyes that wont go away some days. . she thinks its my menstrual cycle causing those symptoms. Which kinda makes sense cuz im dizziest before and during my menses, and ovulation. Nausea more during ovulation. Keep track of when it happens, see if you can find a link there, she also advised me to see a gastro doc."
"Thank you all for your stories, it helps to know I'm not alone in this. I'm so confused with my disease righ now. My sjogrens is seronegative so I assumed I would be spared these systemic issues. On top of that the doctor just told me my joint pain is actually unrelated to all this shit, and I'm hypermobile. /rant"
Have you looked into physical therapy that addresses the vagus nerve? I have a great PT who has shown me several things that help a lot.
Probably all of our meds have nausea as a side effect. Have you ever tried gone off anything to see if that was the issue?
How can s/he say it's unrelated when it's right on the symptoms list? Why don't you get someone who is better aware of current research? https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353216
I have not heard of PT of the vagus.  I’ll have to do some research into it.
Thanks
"I got it even when I was only on birth control. It was pretty weird, I am wondering if it was due to constant kidney stones."
"My joints aren't swollen, so inflammation didn't seem likely. I've actually been responding pretty well to physical therapy for hypermobility. It was actually quite funny: I went to the rheumatologist with a whole list of questions about inflammation and Plaquenil. The doctor politely listened to my story, then moved my elbow around for ten seconds and diagnosed me. I felt so stupid :')  It's a good lesson to not assume everything is related to my Sjogren's."
"Oh sorry, PT is for ""physical therapist."" She's shown me various techniques to calm it down and keep it from ramping up muscle contractions that cause pain."
I had it awfully on the pill; I couldn't hang. This was back in the 80s when they were way too strong.
Mind if I ask you what your diagnosis was?
"Hypermobility. (as well as Sjogren's, ofc)"
"Basically,my joints are so flexible that I continually overstretch myself, straining the tendons and muscles. This leads to pain in the joints, muscle pain, and 'growing pain'. For instance, the overstretching of my thumb can be felt all the way past my elbow on bad days. Cool stuff."
"Two of my kids has hypermobility, but one has been diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome. You aren't tall and skinny, are you?"
"The doctor has ruled out Marfan's, thankfully. I hope your children are coping all right =/"
"I'm was prescribed them a few weeks ago and they do taste pretty icky. I've only been taking them once a day since they taste so bad, but what can help is to press on your face on the area between the eye corner and nose bridge. I do it ranging from 30 seconds to a minute and it helps quite a bit. Here's a picture in case you need a visual: https://drleesb.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/punctal-occlude.jpg"
Never heard of this before. How does xiidra compare to restasis?
Oh man I want this prescription so bad but my insurance refuses to cover it. About to start a dispute with them--I am desperate.
"Yes, Xildra tastes bad. My sister drinks something as a chaser after instilling the drops to mask the taste. My ophthalmologist suggested getting punctal plugs to prevent what tears I had from draining. She said if that didn't work, I could try to Xildra again and at least I wouldn't be able to taste it because the drops would drain outside my face rather than inside. I ended up getting punctal plugs (top and bottom) which are working pretty well so I'm not interested in Xildra anymore."

"By the way, in case you or other readers don't know, there's a Xildra co-pay program. https://www.xiidra-ecp.com/iiris-patient-access#"
"Good luck! I was able to win a dispute, but it took over two months and several calls and letters from my eye doctor."
I have punctal plugs and it still tastes awful.

That discount program is pretty much worthless BTW....
"Do you have top and bottom punctal plugs? If only bottom, the top can overcompensate and have a suction effect which would enable you to taste Xildra and also cause increased dryness. Plugging top in addition to bottom can help alleviate dryness and taste."

Having insurance and the value of it is a factor in determining value of the discount program. Good for some.
"I only have bottom plugs. I didn't even know there were top holes to plug! Xiidra works amazing for me....almost total dryness resolution. Unfortunately my insurance does not cover it, so I could only use the free sample from my Doc and the 1 month free from the discount plan. Even on the ""discount"" it was over $300/month :("

My stupid insurance will pay for Restasis which is the exact same price but won't cover a far superior drug. Maddening!!!!
Chemotherapy is used to reduce inflammation when used to treat autoimmune disorders. It isn't the same thing as the chemotherapy a cancer patient would receive. One such drug is methotrexate and I have been on it for about 6 years until my doctor recently wanted me to try a different medication.

"I would take 10 tabs once a week and would have to have blood drawn every 12 weeks. The only side effect I had was a really rare one, but also really minor (to me). I basically developed lactose intolerance that would go away any time I stopped taking the drug."

[Here is an article](http://www.webmd.com/arthritis/chemotherapy-drugs#1) that might help explain how chemo drugs are used in Sjogren's and some of the more serious side effects. Just remember that all drugs and all procedures have side effects which can include allergic reactions and lots of reactions varying from very minor to very major.
"I'm about to start Methotrexate soon.  MRI showed a lot of inflammation in ankles that's not responding to other anti inflammatory drugs.  Came on very suddenly and has been going on for 5 months, so it's getting old.  Seronegative arthritis is what I was told.  Not super thrilled about going on it as I have a knack for reacting to medicines that are supposed to work, but it's not like I can stay off my feet any more than I do and still have a job."
"What does your moms doctor hope to gain from this? Methotrexate is a chemo drug normally used to treat certain symptoms of Lupus, which Sjogrens shares symptoms with, but it's not full blown chemotherapy."
"Everyone with Sjogren's syndrome should look into LDN - low dose Naltrexone.  It's amazing, cheap and extremely mild compared to Methotrexate."
"I was put on methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug, at a dose about 1/10th of most cancer patients.  Still, I was maxed out for my condition: psoriatic arthritis.  I can see why sjogren's would be treated with chemotherapy, as it's an autoimmune disorder, and systemic immunosuppressant drugs are recommended for it. My experience was not good.  I lost a lot of hair. I felt sick all the time, and very sick taking it the day of.  It's a neurotoxin, so over time it builds up in your system.  I was on it for 2 years, and had many adverse effects.  Diarrhea for 7 months.  30 lb weight loss.  nausea.  vomiting."
"headache.  light sensitivity.  confusion.  memory loss.  aches. paleness.  black around my eyes. Although, I may just be one of the patients that has adverse effects to it.  Many people have success.  It's one of those things that your mom could try and see if it is worth it, and helpful, and if not, then discontinue.  One thing with autoimmune diseases is that you have to listen to your body.  Tell your mom to listen to her body.  It's a scary decision to go on chemo, and it may be worth it for some and not for others, like me.  It depends on how well she tolerates it."
I have never heard of chemo being used for sjogrens. Can you explain more? What does the doctor think it will do?
"P.S.  If you take methotrexate, you get sick all the time.  And it can be fatal.  I was sick ALL the time.  I would get sick just thinking about getting sick lol.  And it hits you harder and for longer.  Then when you finally get better, you're sick again.  I wouldn't personally take methotrexate for sjogrens, which I have.  I am on Humira, a biologic which is a more sp3ecific kind of immunosuppression.  I don't get as sick as often, andd it is helpful."
Thank you for being brave and thoughtful enough to share this with me. I greatly appreciate it.
absolutely. If you have questions I will answer.  I'm not a TMI-phobe lol
"Antibody levels are not particularly tied to symptom severity. Roughly a third of SS patients are estimated to be seronegative; that is, test negative for any SS-specific antibodies. There was actually [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4137866/) that found seronegative SS patients had slightly worse symptoms than seropositive ones. With such a minor change in your serology, I doubt it is particularly indicative of anything important. What is most important is finding treatments that help with your specific symptoms."

I am going through some of the same symptoms.  Certainly could be Sjogren's.  The only real way  to be sure is getting a lip biopsy done.  I have Hashimoto's and 1/2 the doctors I see say that the symptoms are from that and the other 1/2 say it can't be the Hashimoto's.  I feel like a dog chasing it's tail.
"Could be the environment and meds combo.  Without the biopsy, you won't know.  You can get the SSA and SSB blood tests done but I read that those only show antibodies for about 60% of the people tested.  Hope you find out some more concrete answers and feel better soon!"
"Some of the things you experience are certainly things people with Sjögren's also experience, BUT that long list of medications and living in the desert are likely contributing factors.  Idk about the sex drive, to my knowledge that's not really a Sjögren's thing. if you are still on birth control that can certainly kill your libido. I have never been less interested in sex than I was the year I was on the pill. Same with weight gain- that sounds more like a hormonal thing than sjogren's."

"LASIK can make dry eyes worse- afaik it is not recommended for people with chronic dry eye (sjogrens or not) to even get it.  So don't freak out just yet- a rheumatologist can tell you if you have sjogren's but from what you described it is not unreasonable that the side effects of your other medications and LASIK are contributing to a suite of symptoms that mimics Sjogren's, but isn't actually sjogrens."
"In case there was any doubt still in your mind: it's not the climate. But as someone who has a good chance of suffering from Sjogren's, you should definitely cover up, as you're much more sensitive to UV light."
I have all the same symptoms. I also live in the desert (California desert) and also take oxycodone daily. I've wondered if it's from the Meds and the dryness here as well
"Thanks so much!  Thyroid issues are the only other thing I could think of in terms of my symptoms, but my blood tests keep coming up fine.  Albeit I haven't had any ""special"" thyroid tests beyond just the basic blood test, but yeah.  Hope to get it figured out soon."

"Sucks that the docs are so split on your Hashimoto's symptoms!  Sounds like a lot of doctors aren't too knowledgeable about milder thyroid disease manifestation.  They know how to spot life-threatening stuff like myxedema coma but often blame milder symptoms on aging, menopause, etc."
THANKS for the insight!  I'll follow up w/ my doc for sure.  Good to know it might not be Sjogren's :)
"Hey, are you me? ;)  If you ever have the lip biopsy thing done, please let me know your results!  I'll be moving out of the desert soon, so if the dryness keeps up at this level I'll probably look into it further."

"My lips are literally peeling right now from the few OxyContins I've taken in the past few days (I only take one per day, and only take them one week per month...*if* that).  I know they cause dry mouth but this seems excessive."
"Have them test your thyroid antibodies.  That is the best way to test for Hashimoto's.  Many doctors only want to run TSH and T4, but that is not enough.  They should run antibodies (TPO at the very least although there are others), T3, Free T3, T4 and Free T4 among others.  There are some really good Facebook pages (closed groups you can join) for both Hashimoto's and Sjogren's.  You can learn a ton.  Hope you get some answers soon!"
"Ahh, good to know!  That's the info I was looking for.  Thanks so much.  I've read books on autoimmune disease and Hashimoto's, so I have a basic understanding but still don't know much about the diagnostic side.  Thanks again!"
"I was diagnosed 3 years ago after a lifetime of dental problems and dentists yelling at me, calling me a liar ect. Most of my bottom gums have separated from my teeth and I'm just waiting for them to start chipping and falling apart so they can be pulled. I've been told there isn't really anything I can do but it really does feel like I'm falling apart. At this point I'm looking forward to it so I can get fake teeth and not have to worry about it another day."
"God, what our society allows to happen to people is so wicked. One patient I know not only had to go through bridges and painful extractions, but then their insurance denied coverage for 'dental work' even though it was Sjogren's-related."
"Hi, I have a lot of experience with caring for someone with sjögrens and mixed connective tissue disease, but am not a physician."

Mouth:
Have you spoken with your primary care physician about pharmacy solutions to dry mouth? Pilocarpine is an example of a drug that increases saliva production for some patients.

Eyes.
"Google ""dry eye sleep mask"" and you should find some options that might help with the night time dryness. Effectively they are like reverse swimming goggles, keeping moisture in as you snooze. Also, get a humidifier for your room.  These are non-pharmaceutical interventions that could make a big difference. Also, the sleep goggles typically block out all light, which can help with sleep hygiene."
"As far as pharmaceutical interventions, talk with an ophthalmologist or optometrist about it. They will help you treat the dry eye specifically. Some drugs like Restasis are helpful for some people. Other people can manage with over the counter artificial tears."

"There are a couple of procedures wherein a ophthalmologist or machine run by an ophthalmologist can work some of the glands on the edges of your top and bottom eye lids, if that specialist determines they are not producing lubricating oils properly. Might be worth asking them to check the glands: https://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/141"

"Finally, tear duct plugs can be implemented in cases where tear production is too low to have any tears siphoned off of the cornea. This is not a terribly invasive procedure."

Vagina:
"This one is a bit tougher, as the majority of the symptoms I have encountered so far are eye, mouth and lung related. Lubrication before intercourse is phenomenally important though, and using coconut oil has been a non-synthetic solution for dryness.  Obviously be careful of allergies here."

"Feel free to PM me for follow up, or to talk more about lung symptoms if you are concerned."




"So sorry this is happening to you! You seem to be very knowledgeable about the medication out there; I'm afraid I can't help you with any of that. What does help for me is chewing lots of gum (during the day, obvs) and using mouth gel during the night. Are you using any supplements? I'm not sure if it will make a difference but you can always try."
Best of luck!
"My rheumatologist prescribed eyedrops to use in my mouth to increase saliva production: Isopto carpine 4%, 1 or 2 drops, 2 or 3 times per day. He also set me up with CBD cannabis oil (1:20), through CanniMed, for joint pain. He suggested that since I take it before bed, it may also help lubricate my mouth. I haven't noticed this improvement, but yay if it helps."
"I often break/bite off a piece of a no sugar added cough drop (1/8 of a candy) and fall asleep with it on my tongue. I'm not sure if this is damaging, long term (e.g., mouth's pH), but it seems to help add moisture into the night."
Good luck!

Biotene. Take it always.
"You may have trapped gas bubble issues in the intestine. When the vagus nerve below the pancreas gets compressed by gas, and pushes upwards it stops the production of eye lubrication (and salivary output) . Your mouth will also feel bone dry as a result.   You would have to see an gastroenterologist. Crohns/colitis would be the likely diagnosis."
Have you tried Oralieve products for your dry mouth? They have a spray for day time use and a gel which is good at night time - gives 4-8 hours relief.

The toothpaste and mouthrinse are good if you have a sore mouth as there is no SLS or alcohol in the products which can make your mouth more dry
For the vaginal dryness: Organic virgin coconut oil has been my Savior. Try it! It is also a wonderful lube.
"Rheumy can offer meds i.e. Plaquenil which seems to be a common drug for Sjogrens. I take 2 pills (400mg) a day, and it has REALLY helped my fatigue and mood. It is supposed to slow Sjogren's from progressing and works on the organs, it may or may not help with lacrimal glands. It primarily helps joint pain (takes 6 months for full effect). You need an eye exam every 6 months to a year to test for eye toxicity - the drug may cause blindness."

"Pilocarpine - this drug helps produce saliva in short bursts, so some people take a pill 3x a day. It increases your heart rate and makes you sweat a lot more than usual. I am on half a pill 2x a day and so far that is perfect for me."

"If you aren't already, manage your eye pain with:"

Artificial tears - I like Refresh Advanced. Use as much as this throughout the day as you like.

Muro 128 - I use the generic brand from Amazon.com. It's a gel you put in the eyes at night while you sleep. My eyes get very dry at night so this stuff is a lifesaver.

"Drink lots of water, your body needs it."

"Avoid processed food, processed/refined sugars, carbohydrates and gluten. Eat lots of leafy greens, vegetables, and lean meats. Avoid processed meat and nitrates while you're at it. Eat as clean as possible and be strict with it, inflammatory foods play a part in your symptoms."

"Exercise, to combat depression from this disease and to help with symptoms."

"Get a dental exam every 6 months and have your dentist prescribe you Clinpro (or any rx toothpaste with extra fluoride) and chlorohexadine mouth wash. Dry mouth = bad teeth. Brush after every meal, morning and night."

"My dentist also gave me xylitol, which is a naturally occuring sugar that keeps plaque from forming. I have xylitol ""Ice Chips"" which is a candy. I also have gum, ""Spry"" from Amazon.com. Good for teeth health according to my dentist, and helps me produce saliva, I've noticed."

"That's all that I'm doing for the moment. I have no joint pain, just dry eyes + mouth + fatigue, gluten sensitivity, lactose intolerance, seasonal allergies, dust/grass allergies (which dry my eyes so I have other meds for that), and general sensitive stomach issues. There are a couple of very active Sjogrens Facebook groups which you may get some good info. from."


"Two great comments already. I do have joint pain so additionally I drink two cups of tumeric tea with coconut milk and a dash of pepper. The supplement sea buckthorn has cured my dry eyes, such a relief."

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Sjögren's Syndrome foundation and Sjögren's Syndrome alternative therapy groups on Facebook. There are some men your age in those groups and they are very active.
"There are already a lot of good recommendations on this thread. I am a male and in my 30s, and I've documented a lot of my findings and struggles on [my blog](http://www.whatyousjo.com), including my [treatment protocol](http://www.whatyousjo.com/treatments/my-treatment-regimen/). /u/MisterMaury has already mentioned LDN and the excellent related Facebook group. You may also want to investigate helminthic therapy. It is a less common treatment strategy, but one that I and others have found quite helpful."
That was a fantastic write up.  I too am a male who was diagnosed with Primary Sjogrens at age 40.

"The only thing I'd add is to look into LDN ( low dose naltrexone).  It is fairly cheap and extremely well tolerated unlike many of the harsh drugs that folks sometimes take for this disease.  Plaquenil helps, but LDN was like a miracle drug for me. (Alas, it doesn't work for everyone, but for those it does, wow!)  It significantly reduced my brain fog and fatigue."

"There is a great Facebook group called LDN for Sjogrens, Lupus, etc. That is a closed group that is very educational. Lots of smart folks on there sharing info. There is also a men with Sjogrens group on FB as well  though it isn't very active."
What state do you live in? You should be able to get free or reduced cost healthcare if you can't afford it.

"Gastrointestinal permeability has been found in every autoimmune disease that's been checked. There are doctors that believe the etiology of autoimmune disease may stem from issues in the gut. So, sadly your gut issues are to be expected."
Constipation. Mad constipation. ☹️which intuitively makes sense... Everything else is dry!
"Definitely have a history of digestive issues myself. Path to diagnosis for me actually started with gall bladder removal, which led to blood test results taking it down this path. Specifics are sporadic bouts of abdominal cramps (like stop me in my tracks and break out in a sweat levels), bloating and discomfort throughout my 'core'. Like you, can never tell what is SS related versus other, and my diagnosis is less that 6 months old so still triangulating all the pieces.  Not sure if useful to you, but that's what I have experienced."
"As for GI problems, for me it was constant nausea and acid reflux for quite awhile. I cut out anything acidic from my diet and chocolate (which I thought I could never do) the problems went away after awhile and I'm back to eating normal...no sign of it coming back, keeping fingers crossed"
"Happens to me in my feet and face. Try to relax, I know it's hard. There is a Facebook group you could join called Sjögren's Sydrome Foundation w like 5k members and is very helpful too."

Which blood tests did you have done? Lots of AI diseases mimic each other and other syndromes.
"Look into ""small fiber peripheral neuropathy"" sounds very much like what you have."
A lot of autoimmune diseases cause nerve pain and damage.
"I have SLE And SS and peripheral neuropathy was what motivated me to finally get diagnosed. I actually quit smoking weed in a misguided attempt to be ""healthier"" and the peripheral neuropathy got way worse. Returning to CBD, plaquenil and diet changes have helped. I rarely get it now."
You might consider the salivary gland biopsy since your labs are negative. I'm actually not surprised about your doc's suspicions since you have a pretty classic Sjogren's presentation.
I recently read about a relatively new early detection test called Sjo that can be done by an eye doctor. It includes detection of three distinct biomarkers other than what you've already had tested.  http://www.bausch.com/ecp/our-products/diagnostics/sjo

"Also, Sjogren's World Forum is another support group option where a conversation about the Sjo test is currently on the first page of a message board there. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=ae219a27c76c35bf21616c0ea01cf51f&board=1.0"
"Thanks, yeah, relaxing is not something I've ever been good at and am even worse at with all of this going on.  I am a member of a Sjögren's support group on Facebook, and I was initially a member of another group but people on there we're talking about wanting to commit suicide so I felt like that was the wrong place for me.  I had ANA, Rheumatoid Factor, Sedimentation Rate, SS-A, and SS-B done... All normal.  Which is making it tough to get a diagnosis, even though I've read that at least 30% of all people with Sjogrens have normal bloodwork and 50% of people with neuro symptoms corresponding to Sjögren's have normal bloodwork.  Very frustrated :("
"It does sound very similar to what I have, thanks.  Unsure how to get treated for it though..... I guess I need to try to get a referral to a neurologist as well, it took me months to get someone to refer me to a rheumatologist."
"Thanks, this is super helpful.  I've heard that pot can actually help with neuro issues, so go figure right??  Probably not the best option for me because I am a little schizo on weed though.  I've heard good things about plaquenil as well.  What diet do you follow?"
"I am open to it and ANYTHING that might point towards an answer! My ENT dr didn't want to do it because when I saw her I was in a brief period of non dry mouth (at least not as bad) - go figure, the timing couldn't have been worse..... 99% of the time it hurts to talk my mouth is so dry but I was nice and normal for her examination!  I will ask the rheumy about it for sure."
"Wow, that sounds great.  I wonder if I could get that test even though I don't have dry eyes (yet).  So far it's about the only symptom I DON'T have."
"I was tested for Sjogrens by a rheumatologist and because it was negative, I was told I didn't have it. I finally got my diagnosis because my eye surgeon recognized the disease, I had 0's in both eyes on the Schirmer's test and he knew about this new test. It confirmed it. My current rheumatologist says I have Sjogrens but she also says the rheumotologist community hasn't accepted this test yet for diagnosis. She thinks it's something they should be looking at."
Ok yeah that group is like...sometimes a big bag of debbie downers but I have gotten some good support on it myself.

Why does your doc think Sjogren's? Just dry mouth?
"You can get CBD products with no THC. They have no psychoactive properties and work great. I eat keto as much as possible, usually one big meal per day and fast or eat snacks in between. Avoiding sugar and carbs as much as I can has made a massive difference for me."
Dry mouth for several months and now these weird neuro symptoms on top of it....
"That is so strange, so many things can cause that. That being said, negative blood work by no means rules out an AI disease. This could be any number of things. Do your hands turn white when they get cold?"
"Not that I can remember, but it's like 99 degrees here so it's hard to remember, haha.  Yeah, I don't even know what to ask to be tested for at this point.  Hoping this rheumatologist will know what he's doing..."
I'm just really surprised they would jump to Sjogren's just by dry mouth. A lot of doctors still don't even know what it is. Full body aches? Fevers? Joint pain? Swollen spit glands or lymph nodes? GI problems?
"No, nobody has confirmed Sjögren's yet, I'm still waiting on an appt with my rheumatologist to try to get some sort of a diagnosis.  No fever, swollen glands, or GI problems.  Only terrible dry mouth since May, and then over the past few weeks gradual onset of fatigue, scary (really scary) numbness and neuro tingly symptoms, and yes some minor joint pain in fingers.  I did also get diagnosed with sudden onset of adult asthma in March do to chronic chest tightness (after a ct scan ruled out anything more serious), and that's not 100% controlled by my maintenance inhaler so I have no idea if that's related or not.  My primary care physician did blood tests to check for kidney and liver issues as well as diabetes as well as all of the autoimmune markers and everything in the blood work came back ok.  I guess I don't even know where to turn at this point.  If it's not Sjögren's then I'm doubtful the rheumatologist could even help me."
Are you taking any new meds/supplements/antibiotics? The rheumatologist will definitely be able to point you in the right direction. I know asthma can FOR SURE cause numbness and tingling in extremities and dry mouth. Could also explain the fatigue.

"There are so many AI syndromes that cause neuropathy, but there are also a ton of treatment options too! Your blood panel coming back without anything alarming is a great sign too."
"Whoa I had no idea asthma could cause any of that.... Just went to my pulmonolgist today for a follow-up and she wants me to do some type of test that can help to determine if you really have asthma since I'm still having symptoms of it.  It sounds lovely, they give you a breath test, then give you ""triggers"" that would would flare your asthma if you really had it, then give you another breath test to see if you do any worse.  Will be interested to see what that comes back with.  Also very reassuring to know there are treatment options for neuro issues..... I have zero knowledge of that whole arena and find it really f-ing frightening."
"I had dry eyes/mouth and GERD for years and did not even realize there was anything wrong, it was when the terrible (I mean really bad) joint pain came along that I saw a doctor about it."
Diagnosed to SS about 3 months ago. Pretty similar symptom set to those you have. My digestive issues were the least identifiable but definitely intermittent periods of some distress. Also am subject to getting very cold fingers and pretty cold toes anytime the weather gets cold. Good luck!
"My mouth and eyes were dry but I didn't realize they were so much drier then other people's. My eye doctor and dentist mentioned it but no big deal. I'd get brain fog, fatigue, joint pain and short flares. If I went out in the sun at all, I'd be absolutely exhausted. Until I started getting knocked down with what I now know are flares that lasted about 3 days did I think, ""hey, there's something wrong with me""."
I think my early symptoms and the symptoms that made me see a doctor were totally different:

"Early symptoms: Tons of cavities before the age of 20, including a root canal and a huge crown. Couldn't wear contacts but just thought that they irritated my eyes too much (didn't feel especially dry... but they probably were). Couldn't play sports because I would get crazy joint pain and shin splints within hours of exercising. Had to quit my favorite sport (yoga) because of constant wrist pain."

"Symptoms that made me see a doctor: Unrelenting SI joint pain for 2 years that wasn't helped by any medication or any physical therapy. Then the joint pain started spreading to my fingers, hands, elbows and knees. Then my dry eye became unbearable and my gums started bleeding despite diligent brushing."

I think I've been having symptoms for over 10 years and I'm 27 years old and was just diagnosed recently.
"I had gastro issues and dry eyes for years but sort of assumed they were something everyone dealt with (""I must just have a sensitive stomach."" and ""It must just be these contacts or the lense solution I'm using."") so it wasn't until I started getting random intense pain and swelling in my parotid glands at breakfast and difficulty swallowing while at the gym/during heavy breathing that I started investigating. 2 years later (a relatively quick journey to diagnosis) and we had landed on SS."
Is it any easier to manage knowing what the problem is?
"Sort of? I at least know what is happening and why. But, the disease has progressed so much in the last 2 years, nothing I do or medications I take appear to help. My problem is that I may have had this since I was a child and it was too late by the time I got a diagnosis. The good news is that if you diagnose and attack it early, lots of people seem to be able to control it much easier."
I'm so sorry you've had it this rough. Best to you.
Thank you!
Dry eyes suck and there is no cure.

"I personally found many eye drops make my eyes worse, a part from the 'systane gel drops' (http://www.systane.com/Gel-Drops.aspx , I feel these make my eyes less sensitive, like a slight protector layer around my eyes. Systane Balance and Ultra did nothing for me). I also have to constantly wash my eyes out with warm water, which helps temporarily."

"Have you tried Theratears Omega-3 supplements? Dosage is 3 pills a day, and it may have helped me a bit, I'm not sure whether it's placebo or not but I think it helps my inflammation around the eyes when taken for a month non-stop."

So maybe give those theratears fish oil supps a try?
Maybe look into Serum tears. I think they mostly reserve them for extreme cases but you definitely sound like you could use them. They use your own blood and dilute it. It is supposed to be better than preservative free vials.
Are you on any other medication? I have moderate dry eyes but certain medications can cause them to burn and tear constantly. This happened to me when I was on a nasal spray. Also get tested for allergies if you have not done so already. It sounds like something is triggering your worsening eyes on those days. I would try keeping a diary of your symptoms to see what is triggering it. I am also a 22F recently diagnosed. Good Luck! Hope you find what works for you!
"Thank you! I've never heard of Serum tears. I will definitely bring that up to my ophthalmologist and see what he thinks. And yes I take allegra, wellbutrin, and flonase daily. I have tried going off the allegra and the wellbutrin and that didn't seem to help. I will have to play around with the flonase and see if that makes a difference. Thanks for the help and good luck with your diagnosis as well!"
Thanks! I was on Flonase and what you are describing is exactly what happened to me. My eyes would constantly burn and no matter what I put in they would only burn more. If you look up the side effects it can cause tearing of the eyes. I'm now on QNASL which is a new medication that is a powder and is supposed to cause less irritation. So far my eyes have actually gotten better since switching to it.
I was diagnosed very recently too. I'm a male.

"To be honest, it's been a shit-show for the past 2 yrs, with everything from GI issues, to hand joint issues, to dry eyes. The latter is the one that's stuck the most - along with random GI and more recently gallbladder issues."

"At first glance, it seems like SS is just dry eyes and dry mouth. But when you find others with it, you realize, for many, it's a virtual kaleidoscope of symptoms and issues, beyond the dryness."

"I ""just"" have Sjögren's (well, and scle) but I wanted to give a shout out to the Sjögren's Syndrome foundation and Sjögren's alternative threapy fb groups. Both very active, both with lots of people with multiple AI issues. You will get a ton of replies and  both groups have a ton of files, great resources."
I was recently diagnosed and the GI symptoms that someone else mentioned are a big issue for me. I've been miserable for a few years but my family doctor was not taking me seriously. I found another doctor who immediately did a blood test and found this I need good information. I'm glad that I found this sub.
"I was diagnosed first with Sjögren's Syndrome but then ended up with several other autoimmune disorders including Lupus. It turned out my SS was secondary, not primary. This is a good resource for SS info. You might want to sign on here. This board and the people on it are great. They were very helpful to me when I was first diagnosed."

"Primary male here.  I'd ask your doc about LDN. (Low Dose Naltrexone)   I had tried Plaquenil without much improvement for a year or so, but within 24 hours of taking LDN I was a new person.  My fatigue and brain fog dissappeared.  I was lucky my rheumatologist was up on the latest trends in treatment as I'm amazed how many people have never heard of it."

"Doesn't work for everyone, but about 50% or so claim amazing results.   It's cheap and doesn't have any real side effects either."

Best of luck and let's hope it remains primary.  Those other AI conditions aren't ones we want.
[deleted]
Fatigue and brain fog mostly...
"Salagen is an alternative to Evoxac (prescription drugs that produce saliva). Also, he should frequently sip water and swish it around his mouth, and exercise proper dental hygiene because dry mouth can lead to dental problems. Dry mouth sprays and oral rinses by ACT, Biotene and generic can be found at drugstores. Sleeping with a vaporizer helps, as does using a personal steamer as necessary."

Check out Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation's website for information. https://www.sjogrens.org/
I was thinking about this post for awhile and how best to respond to it.

"First off, xerostomia is a common symptom of a host of different diseases. So you really do want to have him tested by a rheumotologist because there are diseases much more treatable than Sjogren's that it could be symptomatic of."

"Second, you can't give yourself an autoimmune disease. It's a very complex process that is still not well understood by the scientific researchers working on it. You don't pick at something then get an autoimmune disease. From what I've read though even people who have been historically healthy as horses - an autoimmune disease will be something that sidelines them. You physically can't do the same things anymore even if you are happy. So be careful in case you are looking at fatigue and interpreting depression. Fatigue and depression are different. If he has Sjogren's - the fatigue is very strong."
http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/bid/342548/13-Types-of-Sjogren-s-Fatigue


"Buy him a book on it to start, probably one that has tips - something to focus on managing it. Then if the products he's using are ineffective, you could go afield for other options; Evoxac is useful for a lot of patients, I don't know if you can still get Oramoist but that was a really popular one, MouthKote gives out samples. Lastly I'd see a Rheumatologist and check for other diagnoses like Fibromyalgia or other nonspecific autoimmune labs, because while depression is common Fatigue is almost always co-morbid and it may be his depression is just an interpretation of his fatigue."
"I'm 26 and having a family that at least tries to understand makes a big difference. They ask questions (but not too personal) about how I'm doing and and genuinely want to learn more about my world. If I'm too tired to talk about it, that's fine, too. Since they know a little about the illness, it's easier for me to be honest with them about what I need."

"Also, having my family not only giving me permission but encouraging me to take breaks during family get togethers/outings has been pretty important. It may be because of my age but I feel a need to push myself and act like everything is fine...if I go to far, I definitely pay for it."

The simple fact that you're asking for tips makes me think she already knows you care and support her!

Hi there.
1) Everyone in your family needs to accept that there is not a cure for what she has. Right now.
"2) At her age, depending on her stage of the disease, you might want to have someone help her around the home. We have much less energy than normal people and it's painful to admit that."
"Thank you! I hope she knows I want to be supportive of her. I think she does. But we're not the most affectionate family and not touchy-feely. We all get along great though! We just don't say the word 'love' much... that sounds weird and cold, but somehow it works out for us haha! She did send me an email today saying that she felt she was lucky to have a husband and son who are so caring. So I think I'm on the right track. :)"
"Hi! At this point she has developed so many different incurable illnesses, that my dad and I are already pretty aware that this isn't going to go away. So at least we've got that part covered. And she does have my dad around for a lot of things, but he's not retired yet, so she's at home during the day. She seems to be keeping herself busy when she has the energy. Although she is her father's daughter with a general German-stubbornness, and I doubt that she would ever actually ask for help if she needed it. I don't want her to feel like I think she's helpless (because I know she's not!), so maybe I need to find a way to ask if she would like to have more company during the day time."
Can you name some of the promising areas of research regarding stem cell therapy?  Is it mostly limited to glandular manifestations of SS?
"I read that plaquenil abates symptoms in Lupus and RA but, according to 2014 US gov study, not SS. Is there any market drug other the prednisone (a damocles sword among drugs) which does help slow SS progression or keep flare-ups from happening?"

"The CNS (brain fog) involvement of SS is, to me, the most difficult aspect of the disease. It comes and goes. Is it our version of a migraine? I have no idea."

What is your opinion on ebv being a causative factor for SS.
"For now, check out the article in the folder called ""stem cell treatment.pdf"", I have to head into the lab now but I'll be back to give a more detailed explanation and/or decryption of that article and another."
"Ok, so stem cell research is accelerating quite nicely in the last few years.  The ""Recent Review"" paper talk about a good portion of the research in animal models, humans, and humans with similar disorders.  ""stem cell treatment"" goes into much more detail, being the first paper to show HIGHLY EFFECTIVE application of UCMSC (umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells) treatment.  If you are looking for a search term, it's the UCMSC or just MSC in general.  The use of stem cells from the umbilical cord has many advantages over traditional bone marrow stem cells:"

"1. First and foremost, it is MUCH safer for both donor and recipient"

"2. Bone Marrow SC's have to be extracted immediately before donation, while those from the umbilical cord can be preserved for a long time."

"3. According to this study, UCMSC's have shown benefits above and beyond BMMSC's which makes sense given the purpose of the umbilical cord."

"To address your second question, the primary affects benefit the auto-immune responses that normally attack the moisture producing glands.  However, improvements shown were also in overall inflammatory response (which should benefit ALL symptoms) and immuno-regulation in a wide range of circulation.  In layman's terms, it circulates throughout the body very well and the worse your symptoms, the more it can help."

"I think this is an extremely promising field of research, and one I will be keeping my eye on.  The researchers don't express this directly but there is some evidence in their results that suggests that this treatment could actually be used as a preventative measure for children at high risk for SS.  That is, if a child of a parent with SS gets EBV or some other infection (see my response below on EBV activation of pSS and the two articles in the folder), this treatment could keep the immune response from going out of whack during this episode and thus preventing the activation of the autoimmune response.  This is purely my speculation based on what I have researched but I think it is quite possible."
"From what I can tell, Plaquenil has mixed results in clinical controlled trials.  The chemical features of SS can be quite varied and it's my intuition that this is a major contributor as to why it works for some and not for others; a government led study is going to be looking for a fix all and will thus, likely ignore something that works for some but not all people.  I think Plaquenil is worth it to try and see if it improves your symptoms or flare-up frequency because, to  my knowledge, there are not much better drug interventions and I would strongly advise against regularly taking prednisone."

"The CNS involvement is complex.  Many studies have conflicting evidence as to what features serve as biomarkers.  From what I can tell, I'm fairly confident that the brain fog (and other symptoms) manifest from inflamed blood vessels in the brain, which I think is primary as far as causes go and which should, theoretically, be temporarily relieved with anti-inflammatory drugs.  The second contributor is possibly a demyelination of neurons, as in multiple sclerosis, but to a lesser degree than MS, which is, unfortunately, essentially untreatable.  So brain fog should be related to other inflammatory flare-ups, certainly related to dehydration, and to some extent random.  This complication has the highly unfortunate existence of being an underdiagnosed, uncommon complication of an already underdiagnosed disease so it seems to me that we are just getting a grasp on what it is and why it happens = no typical treatment options."

But see my response to the stem cell question for some promising research.
"There are two papers in the folder on this.  In a nut-shell, this is the type of disease that includes some predisposition and some activating event.  I think there is enough evidence to suggest a genetic link to SS, but it is not 100% and you can get it without having parents that had it.  So there is some underlying disposition, as there is with all auto-immune disorders, that probably has something to do with T-cells.  In Sjogren's the activating event seems often to be long exposure to some viral infection, the most classic of which is EBV.  My impression is that the data are quite conclusive on this and accounts from people I know with it suggest that it's quite common for SS patients to have had EBV as children or young adults."

"This is a complex event of what is called ""epigenesis"".  We used to think about genetics as being uni-directional: our DNA codes for certain properties and the environment interacts with those properties over the life span.  However, we now know quite factually that the environment also sends messages back to our DNA and alters it throughout the lifespan, causing different manifestations.  It's likely that the persistent viral infection triggers your DNA to produce more quantity of more aggressive immune cells to combat this infection, as would be normal.  Where it likely goes wrong is the ""off"" switch that returns the production levels to normal and in the absence of the aggressive infection, the immune cells turn on the host and the inflammatory never returns to ""normal"".  Another alternative is that the switch is flipped OFF but maybe not all the way off, then every other time you get an infection it gets pushed ever so slightly back in the ""on"" direction.  This is a very very simplified model of what's likely going on but for understanding it in basic terms, that's essentially what is going on.  This would better explain why onset is normally in middle-aged adults."

"As I mentioned in the stem cell treatment response, it is possible that stem cell treatment which down-regulates the immune and inflammatory responses of the body may be useful preventative measures against the eventual development of SS by turning it more ""off"" in a sense."

The short answer is that it is almost certainly a contributing causative factor.
"The term for all of that is ""epigenetics"", in case you all are interested. It means SS people are vulnerable to developing autoimmune because of their genetics then a triggering event happens like a long term infection. Not everyone with the genetic vulnerability who gets a long infection will get an autoimmune disease. It's kind of a bad luck lotto. Much the same kind of lotto you'd be playing with if you have a genetic predisposition for developing certain kinds of cancer."

It means it might well be EBV that triggers SS but it isn't always the case. It also could be a number of other things that trigger the disease.

"Here's a question for OP, have they identified the genes that are susceptible to future autoimmune disease development?"
"King Dranus, great answer.  Now a hard question:  How do I find a Physician that also knows this."
"Negative.  Neither for a general autoimmunity disposition or SS.  That being said, genetics recently took a big jump forward in 2013 and new techniques that allow for making this connections have come about and I remember reading a paper that called for a use of these techniques in SS research and explained how beneficial it could be.  I don't think it's in my folder because it didn't really present any new information, but I think it was in a high-profile publication so it's possible that studies are already in the works.  Unfortunately, genetics assays can take a long time to complete and analyze and then the amount of time it takes to get a paper from final draft to publication can be up to 2 years (at least in my field) so we might not see the fruits of this research for a few more years."

"I should mention, there are theories and lots of pretty good evidence from the stem cell research that proposes candidate chemical messengers and types of immune cells (T-cells) as playing a major role so there is at least some direction for researchers, they're not going in blind which is good for genetic research.  Check out the ""stem cell treatment"" pdf for some more on those."
"Hmm, good question.  The only advice I could give would be pretty obvious, look for someone who specializes in Sjogrens.  Maybe take a look at the authors of the papers I have up, some of them are probably MD's and they might just happen to be nearby or something."

"My best advice would be to learn as much as you can yourself and bring the information to your physician, feel free to refer him/her to these resources if they are interested in reading the source material instead of just taking the word of ""some guy on Reddit.""  This is primarily why I have put this info up and answered questions in as much detail as I can because honestly, I'm a psychologist, not an MD, but thanks to the research I've done over the past few months, I'm probably more knowledgeable about the research on it than 95% of MD's or more.  Probably more."
The only medicine that works for me is zantac/ranitidine. I've tried just about everything else and they're all useless.

"Aside from that, I have found [chewing gum](http://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/home-heartburn-remedies-natural-remedies-heartburn?page=2#2) to be very helpful. Sugar free in whatever flavor you want. Mint flavoring can make heartburn worse for some people so I'd keep that in mind. Personally I always get Orbit Spearmint (it just tastes the best to me) and it doesn't give me any problems but everybody's body is different."

I have heard that ginger root might be good for this but have never tried it.

"I've had terrible heartburn that I've ignored for too long and now I'm afraid the damage is done. Pain shooting through to my back, esophagus, under lower ribs, even into breast area. Seeing gastroenterologist this week and I'm scared. I'll post if he gives any good suggestions but maybe you should see a gastroenterologist so you don't get any damage."
"I've had luck with cutting carbs and using HCL with pepsin, based on the theory that GERD is from too little stomach acid."

http://chriskresser.com/get-rid-of-heartburn-and-gerd-forever-in-three-simple-steps
"IDK if this is the answer you are looking for, but after suffering from chronic heartburn I finally identified some foods I just needed to eliminate. I always knew there was a cut off for carbs - maybe 5 o'clock or so? Also, nightshades (Potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, etc.). And so, so sadly, the final piece of the puzzle was coffee."

Ginger helps with heartburn. Also some baking soda in water first thing in the morning.

Edit: spelling
"I've controlled it largely with diet changes. Nothing with citric acid in it, no soda, nothing spicy and no nightshades. It's a weird list, but I no longer feel like I'm being burned alive from the inside out."
"I haven't had gum in a long time so I'll pick some up today and give it a try, Thank you!"
hey how'd your appointment go?
"Wow, I figured carbs were good for gerd cause they'd soak up the acid. Thanks for sharing!"
I hope it works for you!
you could try honeyed ginger crystals! they are also basically black magic for nausea. i get them at a local asian market. you just mix it in hot water for tea or cold water for a nice refreshing drink. here is a link; http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Ginger-Honey-Crystals-Pack/dp/B002SWB73C


"I'll look for these the next time I go to the Asian market, thank you!"
"Honestly, it's one thing to come to terms with some sort of injury or illness that's temporary, since you know that there's only one hump you need to get over and then you'll be back to feeling like yourself. It's easier to push through. It's another thing entirely to realize that it feels like someone ran you over with a truck and that you're going to feel like that on and off forever. It's awful to know that your whole life is changing. The fatigue can be totally debilitating. Being stuck in bed with the flu or a broken ankle is hard enough, but at least you have the knowledge that you're going to get better. You can plan for the future and what you want to do when you can get out of bed. We don't get to experience that. We have a lot of hopes and dreams and plans that aren't guaranteed and that takes A LOT of time to process. I'm sure she feels awful about knowing that she's putting strain on you, but she needs you right now. If she hasn't talked to a counselor, that would definitely be helpful! Mine has been helping me work on staying positive and to make little goals that are actually realistic for me. You could also consider counseling too, as its understandably overwhelming to support someone you care about when they're sick. You have to take care of yourself too! Over time, if you can both work on staying positive and being flexible with your expectations, things will get better! :)"
"You can't decide for someone else how to face adversity, I'm afraid. Sometimes a chronic uncurable condition will just not seem like a person can get past it. I believe attitude is the biggest part of what composes a life, but even then imagine how amazing we all could be without the stresses and failures we endure. It's just some people let their failures beat them into different shapes; adversity can be a sledgehammer destroying a foundation or a smith's hammer creating a perfect edge."

"Your adversity is your wife's attitude. You can't approach her problems for her, but you can choose how *you* approach the relationship. Even from the brief post you made, you don't seem like a person who just throws up their hands and quits when things get tough. In a lot of ways chronic illness is like aging; you face a lot of the same hassles, depression, and symptoms. Understanding that getting ""better"" isn't really an option means living the life you now have despite having 'broke some', as my mother would say. There's resources out there for you and her, and there are things you can do to make your lives better, even if your bodies aren't going to improve as decades pass."

"The most important thing is to not just let life happen to you; decide what you want and pursue it. Even if you fail, you'll fail on your own terms."
As someone who was just diagnosed last year let me say its hard work trying to get your symptoms in order and be productive. With me I find that I need to take breaks more often during the day and on some days all I can do is rest nothing helps. Please be patient with her and understand that this is not an easy illness to deal with and no 2 days are alike.


* I am Kim's other half and will say that while it is frustrating to say the least it helps to remember that she didn't ask for this to happen to her and until she can get this in control with meds and diet/exercise it will take time for her to be back to semi-normal. Love her and be there for her is what will help the most in this troubling time.
"Having a bunch of chronic issues myself (including Sjogren's), I think that the most important thing that you can do is be supportive and to not compare her illness to anything else. I know that there are many many responsibilities that you no doubt have to attend to, but even here you mention your accident last Spring. It's really important not to compare hardships, because to her it could be very demotivational as it may make her feel as if she missed a deadline for improvement, and for you it may make you a little bitter because, as good of intentions you may have, you might get a little impatient. This is human nature, but just try your best to be compassionate. You should probably not have expectations of her, per se, but kind of try to make the best of what you can (which is hard) and find small, reachable goals (say,a small chore) to celebrate. It's great if she can finish something, it's an accomplishment and should be recognized as such. This type of positive reinforcement will help you from getting frustrated and help her from getting discouraged, because there is no set timeline for something like this."

"Another good way to make a difference to her is a different kind of emotional support. You say that Sjogren's rules her life (as pain and fatigue can really wear a person down) and I'm sure you've tried to help her with housework and work and etc., but also it's important to realize that she really is in a dark place. You mentioned that she has anxiety and depression, but is she being treated? There is medicine, but also don't forget things like seasonal affective disorder (S.A.D.) that can flare up if she isn't getting out enough (full-spectrum lamps and other things help). Topics of conversation can also really change around things. If you try to make jokes (not at her expense) and make her laugh, it could really brighten her day and take her mind off of the symptoms. If she thinks so much about them harming her, it could increase her pain in a bad self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead of asking her to assess her state of being, it may be good to try and first say something charming and engage in positive talk (perhaps about her favorite TV show, something funny about kids if you have any, etc.) and then bring how she is feeling up. You'd be surprised at how much this can impact the overall attitude in a relationship, it may help you both to maybe not get past Sjogren's, but to manage the difficulties it brings."
"I am 25 and was diagnosed with SS when I was very young. I have been dating my SO for one year now, and I think the worst part for me is that since it doesn't seem ""that bad"" (like dry eyes, dry mouth, big deal!) I always worry that he won't take me seriously or believe me when I say I don't feel well. Sure, I can show him my antibodies and my blood work and all that, but since it seems like such an obscure illness with ""mild sounding"" symptoms, I always feel like he will think I'm being dramatic when I tell him how I feel."

"Let me say he has been nothing but 100% supportive of me, but I just wanted to throw my two scents in and say that one thing you should do FOR SURE if you aren't already is to really make her feel like you understand how she is feeling (even if you have no idea). Don't try to minimize her condition, dont push her to go out and do things (especially if she is chronically tired)....I don't know if I'm explaining this well, but I guess my whole point is that you should try to be as understanding as possible, and also educate yourself on SS as best as you can!"

"One last note: did her attitude change when she was diagnosed? Oftentimes, the diagnosis of a life long illness can be devastating to some people. I was too young to know what I was in for when I was diagnosed, and this is all I have ever known. But being told you have a serious life altering condition, that can lead to serious problems (lymphoma, etc) can really put people into a downward spiral mentally."
"everyone (kittyjam, paradised, kimberly and her SO) my wife and I are reading all of your responses, and it is really helping.  I am a hyper-productive guy, and I don't have a (naturally) good bedside manner.  Your collective advise is falling on listening ears, and I REALLY appreciate it.  I will continue to work on my own limitations to help contribute to her feeling better about her life, and not worse.  thanks"
Maybe this will help- http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/marriage-20-tips-for-men-on-supporting-a-partner-with-chronic-pain/
"Hi /u/LehighLuke, dunno if you are still checking in on this post or not.  Hope your situation has improved.  I am a psychologist who has recently found out that a close friend has Sjogrens and in learning more about it, I want to make a strong recommendation that you suggest to your wife the possibility of going to therapy.  People, especially doctors with no psychological training, drastically underestimate the psychological impact of these sorts of earth-shattering developments.  If she has had anxiety and depression chronically as well, this can (and likely is from your description) a recipe for disaster.  The gold standard of treating psychological depression has been and always will be a combination of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy.  Current day anti-depressants are a practical miracle.  As a psychologist and as someone who takes an SSRI everyday I can say that it does wonderful things for alleviating some of these symptoms and feelings without otherwise impacting your lifestyle or psychology in any detectable way.  Coping with a chronic illness is difficult.  It is more difficult to express what it's like to others, and you, unfortunately can't know or understand lots of that.  Therapists have training and an outside look; again, I highly recommend this, even if once a month or less."

"The next thing, I have to say, is on you.  You seem like a gung-ho guy and obviously you love our wife.  I can't count how many hours I have spent online researching SS.  Obviously, I am a researcher, I have access to resources most people don't have and I can read primary research instead of having someone to tell me about it in simplified terms.  That being said, let me recommend [The Sjogren's Book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sjogrens-Book-Daniel-Wallace/dp/0199737223), which is put out by the Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation and I can say from reading a good portion of it that it is very thorough and accurate.  It is as much for friends and family of patients as it is for patients.  Get it.  The hallmark of chronic illness in the psychological realm is fear and uncertainty.  By educating yourself, you become the front line against this fear by being able to dispel a lack of knowledge with knowledge.  Fear about prognosis, pregnancy, complications, and even psychological stressors; the more you can support her this way the better.  For me it's about all I can do."

"Given my knowledge and limited medical expertise, I also recommended my SS friend start taking a vitamin B supplement to help against fatigue and she has said it has helped.  It will take time to kick in (a common misconception is that vitamins have immediate affects; they don't, it is cumulative), probably 2 weeks or so for noticeable benefits.  When you are deciding which supplement to get, look for one that doesn't ""overload"" the vitamins by giving you like 1300% you daily dose.  Try to get one that covers many different B vitamins but that doesn't exceed 100% by much on more than one of them.  The added metabolic load of excess vitamins could potentially actually make her *more* fatigued."

Best of luck to you friend.  I hope this has helped.
My wife has sjogren's and was diagnosed over 15 years ago.  Attitude is very important.  You should try to get your wife to get her depression/anxiety under better control.  This disease caused my wife depression which made made her more tired and bed-ridden. She decided she was gonna beat the depression with counseling and
"meds, and she was able to go back to work with the sjogrens.  None of her co-workers know she is dealing with the pain unless she tells"
them.
"You will need to be patient with her.  Don't accuse her of being lazy or too tired to show you affection.  It took me a while to stop being selfish, but I realized if I was the one sick she would take care of me."
I know of several women with sjogrens whose husbands left them because of it.  This was very heartbreaking for them.
"My wife has her sjogrens in check with meds for now, and she hasn't had a flare up in over a year.  We take one day at a time and that's all you can really do.  Good luck, and pm me if you need to talk."
"thanks for the reply, I wan't sure how active this sub is.  I think my OP was a little negative in tone, might just be a bad few days and I think I'm getting frustrated.  Today we talked about a simple plan that we are going to put into place to hopefully make some marginal improvement in her quality of life."

* Consistency taking Meds

* Better diet...we're going to try the AIP

"* Some level of daily exercise...anything that can get her heart rate up, even if for 1min"

* Daily meditation

"Nothing earth shattering here, but its a start.  The key is to NOT give up, I suppose. Thanks again for your reply"
"Wow, thank you for such a detailed reply, and all the advice"
You got it. I work with a lot of Sjs patients and have seen that facing it with a plan makes for a world of difference in managing it.
Of course.  As a researcher myself it kind of disheartens me to see how little research goes into the psychological implications of this disease and others.  I hope this has been helpful for your situation!
"You might want to pop over to /r/glutenfree, /r/glutenfreevegan with this. I'll do this for you guys. There is also a couple facebook groups for sjögren's."
Thank you!  I have posted at /r/glutenfree and /r/celiac already.
"Do they know for sure that's what it is, or do you not get your ""official"" diagnosis until your next appointment? And gosh, that's a *long* wait. Pain in the ass. I get my diagnosis on Friday after a month since my initial appointment and I already feel like I'm going to lose my damn mind haha"
Keep calm and wait for the doc!

"I have to say my life changed drastically for the better after diagnosis. I still have horrible flares, but instead of having every day in pain, it's only now and again. I can be more active, I feel mentally more stable since I know why I usually feel the way I do, and the meds have definitely helped a ton."
"A diagnosis can trigger a cascade of different emotions, so rest assured, it's totally normal to be experience mixed emotions and some fear. See if you can move your appointment up if you can, and make good use of the time between by preparing for the appointment with any questions you have. Diagnosis can be a scary time, but it's also an important time and opportunity to take control and become empowered."

Here's a great PDF from the Sjogren's foundation with a list of questions to ask your doc. Hope this is helpful!! http://www.sjogrens.org/files/brochures/dr_questions_dryeye_ss.pdf
Track your symptoms and start work on a binder; your best bet with a long-term autoimmune disease is to have everything in your history ready for easy perusal and summation to keep whatever docs you see informed.

For your nerves you can always remember that while this sucks it isn't a death sentence like pancreatic cancer - it's a manageable condition.
"Absolutely! I'm sorry you have to wait. You can pm me if you want to chat. I have also found the sjogren's syndrome foundation and sjogren's alternative therapy groups on facebook very helpful, they are both active groups. I was diagnosed in December, but like you I've always had pain. I gave up my contacts years ago. Who knew, right? The good news is now that I know what it is I'm managing my symptoms and I'm feeling great, so that is the one good thing: Now that you have a name to this disease you can target it precisely with diet, exercise and maybe even drugs if you need them."
I send positive vibes!
"Thank you yes I feel some validation in knowing there's something real going on. I'm not ""crazy"""
Thank you!
Thank you! I will totally start a binder!!
Thank you I'll pm you shortly.
"No, you're not. And no one should make you feel like you are. :)"
My wife caught HFM twice from our daughter that caught it 3 times at daycare in a span of ~6months. Fun times those were.
Not quite the same but I have spent all of last week wondering why my cold had no coughing symptoms and why the cold pills weren't helping me at all. Reading this it just hit me I might be doing the opposite and this time it was my Sjogren's!
I really feel for your wife and daughter.

I thought you could only catch a virus once?
I certainly understand! I'm still learning to navigate and manage the symptoms. Sometimes they're subtle and I don't recognize it until there's time for hindsight. I hope you feel better soon!
"We thought the same, but apparently there are at least 2 different strains, plus it seems the first our daughter caught it, she was too little (~6mts) to build enough antibodies so it repeated. Hence why daughter got it 3 times, wife only 2."
I guess there's hope they won't get it again!
I have Sjogren's secondary to another autoimmune and I get this. My doc said it's from chest inflammation. It goes away when I take Enbrel or prednisone.
"Yeah, I've had trouble with it too, but I don''t know how to prevent it"
"I have primary Sjogren's and I've had this issue you're describing. I'm also on Evoxac and it seems to help a lot. I also use a silicone lubricant in place of a water based one for intimate relations because it doesn't dry it as quickly. Some days it's good, other days it's not so good, so I just have to test it and back off if there's an issue."
My gyn told me this is a Sjogren's thing and that moisturizers like Replens can be helpful.

"Edit: for the record, I'm 26 so not perimenopausal and this was my gyn's advice."
"Hey, so i've had this exact issue (22 yr. old w/ SJS) and the dryness did adversely affect me during intimacy with stinging sensations, etc. But I learned quickly that there were ways around it, and for me, a good lubricant has made all the difference. I would not worry, as there are many things you can do to improve sensation (more foreplay, silicone lubricant, etc) and enjoy intimacy. It is harder during a flare up, but there are definitely ways around it."

Thanks. I'm super late to responding because this is a throwaway.

"How then, do you deal with gyno exams? Like I mentioned in my post, my last one was unexpectedly terrible, and I'm a bit traumatized now. But I do need to get checked yearly, because I have a history of female cancers in the family."

"If I tell my gyno (haven't seen her since my sjogren's diagnosis), is there something else she can do instead?"
"I'm 22, so I sincerely hope not."
"Thanks for the links. I looked through those, and I'm not feeling super encouraged. Fuck me, I guess."
Ask if there's a numbing cream she can use. My symptoms are improved by the meds I take so it's fine for me now. Maybe you'll find the right meds to help with that. Tell your gyno about the sjogren's as well since you now have a formal diagnosis. Ask if she can be as quick as possible because of the pain perhaps? I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

"I forgot to mention, I also take hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) so that might be affecting my symptoms as well."
Well frankly it's a largely female disease and this is a specifically female problem. They aren't throwing money at it. :/ Have you considered going to the Sjogren's clinic? They may have doctors with a better understanding of SS's impact with gyn issues.
"These are great, keep up the good work!"
Thanks!
"I have crohns and SS. Diagnosed with SS first, and it was actually my rheumatologist who referred me to my gastro. Honestly, I don't know how each one affects the other. From what I've read online there's no correlation between the two. I don't usually go without eating because I turn into a major bitch if I'm starving but if I'm going out for the night with friends I tend not to eat before hand. And if I do eat, it's very light. Because nothing sucks more than having to poop in a bar bathroom."
"My mom has SS and has not been diagnosed with Crohns. However she has had significant digestive issues including a bleeding ulcer. She seems to flip flop back and forth between diarrhea or constipation. She's had an upper and lower gi and they found some polyps in the lower which they removed. She battles with stomach pain, which they think might actually be a neurological issue having something to do with the major nerve than runs down the backside of your stomach (sorry I can't remember the name). But like most things related to autoimmune disease they never seem to be able to give her a definitive answer."
I've been diagnosed with Primary SS and I've had colitis as long as I can remember. There are so many things I can't eat it's ridiculous. I think I found a study linking SS and digestive problems. Let me see if I can find it.

ETA: The one I found is on Celiac.
Thanks for commenting!

"Just one other person having both makes me feel better about my upcoming appointment with rheumatologist.  That last guy really messed with my head.  He somehow had me convinced that I was simultaneously making too much of nothing, (just had to 'live with it') and that I was withholding important information by not telling him every single detail."

Thanks again!
Thanks for responding!

This helps paint me a better picture of possible issues/causes of pain. I hope your mother is able to find something that helps her!

"I really, really wish there was better information on autoimmune diseases."
Thank you!

"I think I've seen that study, but haven't read it thoroughly, I'll go back and read that now."

"May I ask, what kind of medication are you on?"
"As far as the autoimmune issues go just plaquenil. I've been prescribed other things to help, but unfortunately without insurance they are out of my price range. The colitis is largely controlled be diet."
"I feel the frustration of having symptoms all over the place. If you suspect sjogrens, you could directly ask for a lip biopsy or ask for a second opinion. But sjogrens treatment usually targets symptoms, so you could start there without a formal dx. Do you see anyone other than a rheumatologist? Maybe a neurologist or a DO internist could be helpful?"
"What you’ve been through! Sounds like a cocktail of things, not particularly sounding like Sjogrens. An aloe Vera shampoo is very soothing for the scalp, and sometimes a dandruff shampoo will help, won’t cure psoriasis but certainly eases the irritation of it."
"Hiya, you sound like me, friend. I would for sure look into Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. I have that and have all the symptoms you mentioned. Doesn't mean you have it, but it's worth checking out if you do. They have a sub at r/ehlersdanlos. Message me anytime!"
"Keep searching to try to figure out what’s going on, and work on your diet in the meantime while you wait for a diagnosis. The Wahl’s protocol (which is only 1.99 on kindle right now) has some good outlines for teaching you how to track your food/sleep/energy/symptoms, and has good dietary recommendations for ai very similar to AIP. As boring as it is, keeping good food and lifestyle diaries can lead you in the right direction sometimes. People give Dr. Wahls a hard time for saying she can cure disease with food and supplements, but she did cure herself by being a good researcher and note-taker."

"It may be Sjogren’s, EDS, or you’re just generally imbalanced somewhere maybe with some dysbiosis in your gut. You could also try acupuncture while you’re waiting...it can be very helpful and is recommended by John’s Hopkins for AI. Psoriatic arthritis may be a possibility."
"Ive had the sjo test, it’s considered an early Sjögrens test. Also I’ve had the AVISE test done. They are more specific tests that helped diagnose me."
"Maybe try paleo or the autoimmune protocol diets and see if your symptoms improve? I would also suggest good fats for dryness - avocados, fish oil, sea buckthorn, coconut oil - and probiotics."
"I agree with this. Sjogrens treatments generally target symptoms anyway, so any diet and lifestyle changes you can do can really be impactful. The Autoimmune Protocol is brutal at first but cleared my brain fog and has helped my energy somewhat. There’s a sub for it r/autoimmuneprotocol"

It’s so hard with autoimmune diseases because they do have all the weird similar symptoms! But I would say yes it does sound like it.

"My main symptoms are the dry mouth and eyes you are explaining. Another sign is if you stick your tongue out and along the side it kind of looks rippled/wavey and lighter coloured, that is because of mouth dryness too."

Get tested and see what they say...I got “officially” diagnosed with a lip biopsy.
There is a Sjo test.  As well as normal blood work.   Also eye tests are easy enough.

My  Sjo test just came positive.
Lip biopsy’s need to be done  at a good labored that does lots of Sjögrens. Or you can get a false negative.
"This is probably a dumb question, but does the lip biopsy hurt?"
"Not a dumb question at all! I was so nervous. But no, I didn’t feel a thing and it was so easy. The stitches dissolved within a week and now I can’t even tell that anything was done."

"I have heard that some people get a numb lip from it, but I think that’s rare compared to everything going to plan. It’s a very simple procedure :)"
"Same as what losttraveler123 said, doesn’t hurt, it’s quick and they’re efficient. I had it done as well because my blood work came back negative yet I still had the sjogrens symptoms (mine were dry eyes, dry mouth and partial fatigue). So after doing the lip biopsy, my test came back positive."

"You said you had dry eyes, I’d suggest not wearing contacts for a while till you get your results or atleast see a ophthalmologist. I had really bad dry eyes that my own eyelids caused corneal tears cuz of no tear production, so having lenses can make it worse. I didn’t realize it till my vision got worse that I had THAT bad of eye damage."

"Good luck! Once all the tests results come back, everything falls into place"

Oh and water! Lots and LOTS of waterrrrrr
"Good to know, thanks so much for your detailed responses! Do you feel your Sjogrens is managed by medication pretty well?"
"Thanks so much! My eyes are kinda weird. They are dry all the time but the lenses are the worst. After just a bit the lenses feel STUCK to my eyes. Peeling them off is like peeling off the top layer of my eye it feels like. But my vision gets very cloudy and I get these thick goopy crap in my eyes that I can’t see through. I have a slight sensory issue with wearing glasses out so I need to get over it, haha. I appreciate y’all’s feedback a lot as I feel kinda alone in all of this. I see y’all taking time out to answer me. Y’all rock."
"No problem, I like to answer questions I even have a blog about it because it was what I needed when I first got diagnosed."

With the managing Sjogrens with yes - Yes and no.

The eye dryness and mouth dryness with never go away. And that sucks so bad because it’s a pain in the ass.

"But the headaches, fatigue and aches and pains I was getting have got a little better since I’ve been on meds."
"Well, that gives me some hope. Thank you!"
"It took me about five weeks to feel better, and it helped my brain fog and energy. But you may not tolerate some component of the diet, or you could be “reacting” to not having the usual foods your body is used to. Wishing you the best!"
I did it for 2 years and didn’t see any difference in my illness. I did have peaks of energy and weight loss but I still flared all the time. The fat didn’t work for me and I ended up getting gallstones and subsequently having my gallbladder removed!
"Oops. I posted it in the wrong place. Someone said they had a connective tissue disorder, I forgot to hit the arrow to reply to them. So sorry. This is a nasty syndrome that causes different problems with different people. Our collagen is a mess. Look it up. It would be like trying to explain what SS is, other than just dry eyes, nose, mouth and vaginally.  Again sorry for not hitting the button to reply to the right person."
I use it. It works well for me with no excessive swearing. Maybe your dose needs to be adjusted? It helps tremendously with dry mouth.
What connective tissue disorder do you have if you don't mind me asking.
"I can feel it take effect with saliva but I've never seen any effects on sweating or my eyes. Unfortunately, the effects only last a couple hours at most for me."
"I have never heard of this before. The person who diagnosed me just said oh your eyes feel like you have pink eye, but they are fine.  (I have another autoimmune disorder plus a connective tissue disorder), so right away she said I had a different kind of conjunctivitis. It is a kind only people with Söjgrins get. She said I think you have a more advanced type, you can wind up with some nasty problems with your internal organs, and that was that. I am reading more about it online than she ever told me. That was about 9 months ago. But having lived in pain my whole life, with this, it's just an add-on to my other stuff. Sigh and life goes on."
I got too nauseous on Pilocarpine. Switched to Cevimeline. They both cause excessive sweating. Unfortunately these are the only meds available to help produce saliva.
Ehlers-danlos syndrome
I took pilocarpine first but it made my heart race. Switched to Evoxac which helps a little but my face sweats buckets. I can’t ever wear foundation or blush because it just runs off.
Does it stop dryness in your skin all over?
I do have connective tissue disorder! I just never heard of EDS :)
"It’s so hit or miss for me, I never know when I’m gonna be drenched in sweat or sometimes it doesn’t work at all! I use 5mg 4 times a day what’s your dose?"
I didn’t know there were different kinds!
"Same, I have to take it 4 times a day. My eyes are still dry tho. :/"
"I feel your pain I had so many issues and it was a huge guessing game with figuring out what was wrong, that day I was diagnosed with sjögrens, fibromyalgia, connective tissue disorder and ibs 😕"
:/
No I’ve never heard of that.
😕that’s terrible that’s why I’m scared to wear foundation now. I went to the doctor today and he noticed my heart was racing I think it’s because of the pilocarpine too.
No 😓 it doesn’t it only temporarily gives me relief with dry mouth.
My doctor gave it to me about 3 months ago to try out and she told me to take 5mg UP TO four times a day. Right now I'm only taking it first thing in the morning and right before bed (my prime dry mouth times) and then maybe once during the day if I get a flair-up or use any products with THC in them.  I don't have sweating issues now after a slight problem the first few days and it works wonders for my dry mouth within 5 minutes of taking it.

Edit: Mine does not seem to effect my eye dryness at all. I use gel drops before bed for that.

I'd ask about backing off on your dose a bit.
5 mg 2x a day morning and night
"Yep. I also take it four times a day. I think nighttime is my favorite time to take it. Whenever I forget to take it before bed, I definitely feel the difference."
Your connective tissue disorder wouldn't happen to be EDS now would it?
Oh :(
"Same! I’ve been taking it for 3 months 4 times a day, the thing is I don’t get relief to be able to do such a gap like morning and night, after a few hours my throat and mouth gets so dry it hurts to swallow, that’s when I know I need to take another pill 😢"
How long have you been on it? Does it help your dry eyes as well? I’ve been in it for 3 months now
EDS?
Yea :(
"Hmm, it seems like your dry mouth is a bit more advanced than mine. Sorry to hear that!"

"Not to insult your intelligence (I'm sure you already know about these options), but I keep xylitol candies and biotene with me at all times.  I also drink almost a gallon of water a day because I literally always feel dehydrated."
"2 years, and yes, it helps my eyes as well. It took me some time to get my dosage correct."
"Yes, honestly I’ve been having symptoms since 2015 and I had no idea what was causing it until a few months ago. I never heard of xylitol I’ll look into it thank you!"
"That’s good to hear, it gives me some hope! ❤️"
"Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is recommended by dentists as its not damaging to your teeth.  It also happens to promote salivary gland production.  One thing to note is that it is absolutely TOXIC to pets, so keep it out of their reach at all times."

[These](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AJD23Y4/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_DjiCDbQ74T38D) are the ones I use. I keep them in my purse in a little pill pocket thingy.
❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much!
I live in a dry desert climate and Vaseline works on my nose. Just put it on a q-tip and swivel it into your nose.

Are you taking Salagen(Pilocarpine) for the dry eye and mouth? I just took a flight and found that helpful along with small sips of water every so often
Bring eye drops and saline nasal spray for the plane. You can also bring a wash cloth to dampen in the restroom on the plane and breathe in the moisture.
"No I am not, but I will call my rheumatologist Monday and if that ass won’t do it, I’ll call my PCP.  Rheumatologist keeps saying I just have to “deal with it”, and I have an appointment with a new one in September."
I’ve used Vaseline in my nose for years when in Vegas. It works well.
"I don't think I would trust their water. Maybe ask if you could get some drinking water, for medical reasons. Or I think you can buy water while you wait and dampen the cloth that way. The airplane's water is just nasty."
have you seen /r/dysautonomia ?

"Dysautonomia is pretty common for sjorgrens folks. But what you are describing could be a lot of things, from a panic attack to something really serious. Get it checked out. It might be a good idea to get a bp machine and log your pulse and pressure when you feel like this, take note of what's going on, how you are feeing, time of day and any other symptoms."
"I asked for an EKG and my results came back with a few “borderline” issues. Unfortunately the doctor hasn’t told me what this means exactly, but I’m glad to at least know there is confirmation of how I often feel. Good luck and don’t give up trying to figure out what is going on!"
"Have you tried an elimination diet? It can be challenging to change your diet at any time, especially while you’re already hurting. I was in a similar situation and tried the [Autoimmune Protocol](https://www.thepaleomom.com/start-here/the-autoimmune-protocol). It is an elimination diet that can help you figure out if anything you are eating is causing your symptoms."

"I found out I’m very sensitive to all grains, sugar, nightshades, soy, corn, and dairy. It sounds like a lot to cut out, but now that I have I am so much healthier. I hope you find a solution that works well for you ❤️"
I'll tell you what I wish I knew 5 years ago...  LDN.

Low Dose Naltrexone works wonders for about half the people out there with autoimmune issues.

"It's cheap, extremely safe and you simply take it once a day."

There are Facebook groups with thousands of members who swear by it.  Changed my life

"Also, cutting back on sugar can be helpful as well."

https://www.facebook.com/groups/108424385861883/

"FWIW, it was recommended by my rheumatologist. He works in research as well. I'm amazed it isn't the first line of defense, but most rheumatologists aren't eager to learn anything new."
"I haven't tried it myself, but I heard CBD oil works wonders. I have knee flare ups from time to time and NSAIDS burned a hole in my stomach. My rheumatologist prescribed Diclofenac(a steroid gel) that I rub directly on my knee and that works for me!"
I take cymbalta and 1000mg of magnesium to help with pain. I have found that pineapple helps a lot too.
"I take plaquenil and gabapentin. The gaba helps with nerve pain. I have some level of pain every day, but I can manage it. Without the gabapentin, the pain was severe. Ans with out the plaquenil, I was a walking zombie."
I take Lyrica for the neuropathic pain.
"My pain is not nearly as severe as yours, but I've found acupuncture helpful with the joint pain. And no side effects."
Thank you! I have been looking into this... I had gastric bypass surgery a few years ago and I have had a TON of stomach issues since then. I may be able to do a modified plan of this- and I think it would help if I would just go back to eating what I SHOULD eat. However- it is a lot of effort to food prep for weird eating- and money wise lately we have had to eat either what was in my freezer or what I could afford that was on sale. Things are looking up a bit and I am thinking here in the next few weeks school gets started again and it is a good opportunity to start a new routine. I joined the Y and my mom and I are going to start doing water aerobics to help stay as mobile as possible. It is frustrating because I am gaining the weight back I worked so hard to lose and that doesn’t help any of it. Sorry I am rambling... Thank you for your advice. I really appreciate you taking the time to offer it.
Thank you!!
I was on gabapentin a few years ago and that may be a good option for me- I tolerated it ok- except for my focus and concentration- however I am not working so those side effects may not be as bothersome as they were before.
"No worries, I totally get it. I’ve been there. I hope you are able to find a good system that works well for you to get your health back! We’re all in this together ❤️"
"Were you taking it at night? I have to take it then, or I would not be able to function at work.  I had also increased it before decreasing it again.  It has benefits, but like so many other medications, the side effects can be a challenge"
"Yeah, mine kind of between my chin and neck on either side are tender to the touch."

Are you on medication? Have you seen your rheumy lately? Mine upped my dose with this and some other complaints.
"One of my parotid glands is completely mangled with a swelling below that ear. The other is permanently(?) inflamed. Or, at least my rheumatologist seems not to care about that. She's a university-associated doctor that does research and has a ""Sjögren's Syndrome Clinic"", but I'm about to fly that coop and start seeing someone else."
"When they get inflamed, do you go to a doctor to get medication or does it go down over time? Sometimes the glands at the back of my jaw (under my ear) get swollen and painful. Usually when it happens is just one side (and it tends to happen to one side over the other)."
"Stenson's duct is what I meant, if you guys Google that you will see what I mean. I wasn't really referring to the parotid gland itself, but thanks for who answered."
"That’s not uncommon for me.  Sucking on ice and using a soft gel ice pack helps.  When it’s really bad or lasts too long (a couple of weeks or so) then I push for a prednisone dose pack and that usually knocks it back.  That’s not without side effects for some though.  Ibuprofen or Aleve don’t seem to help me with this specific symptom.   I’ve had salivary stones block saliva ducts a few times, but that’s been rare in my long history of SS."
"Yeah, nothing like getting that numb feeling on one side of your face when the gland swells up and pinches a nerve.  For years I was freaked out thinking I was having a heart attack until I learned I had Sjogrens..."
What medication do you take for the inflammation?
"I haven’t tried Hydrus yet, but I’ve looked into it and it’s similar to other products that may be available to you in the UK. I’m not sure what you’ve tried so far,  but here are some of my suggestions."

"Similar products are Liquid IV, Ultima, Nuun tabs and Banana Bag. I liked all of them but they were a bit expensive, so I’ve been sticking to Gatorade. (Not the best choice I know... but it helps me feel more normal without draining my bank.) She could also try buffered salt supplements, I like Thermotabs or Vitassium."

I would also recommend your mom try supplements to help. I’ve been taking Prenatal Omega-3 supplements with high DHA and have had noticeable results in my skin. Vitamin D and Omega-3 DHA are helpful in Sjogrens.
Hello.

"I’m in the UK. I know your asking for a specific product and I can’t help you there, however as your always trying to help with your mums dryness I thought I’d suggest a few things that have really helped me :)"

"One is having a teaspoon of coconut oil before bed. I suffer from horrible dry mouth at night, water does not help! But the coconut oil helps, it doesn’t stop it, but certainly helps."

"I’ve been taking these capsules called Thera Tears (omega 3 supplement) and I truly believe they have helped my eyes. It took about a month or so to kick in? You can buy them off Amazon, i take 1 a day."

"And the eye drops - My main ones are Clinitas eye drops (sodium hyaluronate) 4 x per day and Ikervis eye drops (ciclosporin) 1 drop at night. Both of these are on prescription from my eye doc, you can’t get them over the counter."

Sorry I’m not answering your question directly. Hopefully this helps your mum and others though.
"I looked into all of those, and they're all unavailable without importing as well. We have a water we found here recently for her that seems to have the same/very similar ingredients, and she's trialing that now."

"She has been taking supplements for years (she's had it 11 years), and has noticed a different with the Omega-3 in particular."

Thank you!
"Thank you, I will pass those suggestions on! I know she has some kind of eyedrops that are preservative free, because the ones with preservatives weren't great for whatever reason. I'm not sure which ones she has though. She does take an Omega-3 supplement too which does seem to help."

"The coconut oil is something I know she won't have heard of, so I'm excited to pass that on to her in case it helps. Thanks!"
It could yes. If your gingival tissue is dry it will cause inflammation and your dentures will feel tight. Also make sure you keep them clean.
Be sure to keep them clean - Sjogrens mouth is a great environment for Oral Thrush.
Thank you. No serious problems yet. Dentist did say most of his Sjorgens patients do have problems with the dentures
[deleted]
Do you have a humidifier? I've noticed I sleep better with it on.
"I asked my rheumatologist about the melatonin because I read about it on the Johns Hopkins site but he said it was ok. I was originally doing ibuprofen but it never really made a difference. Also, my pain is minimal it is more uncomfortableness of lymph nodes and gasping when I fall asleep. But thank you"
"when i was gasping so much i couldn't sleep, it was anxiety."
thank you that makes me feel a little better.
My doctor specifically tested for sjogrens.
Sjogren's Antibody SSA/SSB

Blood test.
"I at first thought I didn’t have to bad of dry eyes... but it wasn’t until I woke up morning thinking Id gone blind, that I finally went to the eye doc and realized how dry my eyes were.  My eyes were so dry that my own eyelids scraped my cornea and caused blurred vision.  They healed after a round of (if I remember correctly) steroid eye drops and now I use restasis everyday."

"I have Sjögrens, but my biopsy and bloodwork was inconclusive, and it took a few years to get an absolute Sjögrens diagnosis.  My rheumatologist at first gave me the diagnosis of probable Sjögrens (after bloodwork and biopsy showed nothin).  After seeing him for a year+, and being put on Evoxac for dry mouth (not being able to swallow food  because of the dryness), and already being on restasis for my dry eyes....my rheumy said I definitely had Sjögrens.  I saw my rheumy every 3 months for the 1st year and a half, now I see him every 6 months.  I’ve been going for 5 years."

Good luck!  Hang in there!
>I don't know how else I would get a diagnosis without it.

I believe you can also test for ANA antibodies and a Schirmer's test (putting paper in the eye to measure tear production)
What part of the body gets an ultrasound?  The doctors I have seen so far only keep taking blood tests.
"I haven’t heard of an ultrasound being used to determine if a biopsy is necessary. I would ask if they can do a biopsy anyway just to totally rule this out. Are you located in the US? If they won’t agree to a biopsy, can you get a second opinion?"
Well get another dr. The standard is lip biopsy not the ultrasound. Try to go when ur symptomatic
[deleted]
"The most conservative estimate of the rate of seronegative Sjögren’s (positive biopsy, negative bloodwork) is 30%, but many studies find much higher rates. Unfortunately Sjögren’s can not be ruled out without both bloodwork and a biopsy."
My eyes don't really get dry so tear production would be normal I think and there wasn't a high level of antibodies in my last blood test last year. My symptoms are chronic dry mouth and brain fog. Is a specific test needed for raised antibodies?
"Around the throat area, where the salivary glands are located"
I'll be seeing the consultant tomorrow. So fingers crossed he finds something wrong with my glands.
"Yep, I did 3 different blood tests and nothing showed. Did a biopsy and almost instantly found something wrong."
"I didn’t think I had dry eyes, either.  I just had worsening light sensitivity (caused by lack of tear production)."

Get tested.  You never know.
I also didn't think I had dry eye until I started moistening them.  Turns out an excess of mucous in your eye is a sign of dry eye. My eye doctors always told me I want cleaning my contacts well enough (I was).
"I take infusions of Rituxan. It works. I had tried antibiotics, steroids and NSIDS. None of that worked. The infusion do the trick and I have relief for about 100 days."
It’s so painful. I feel for you.
"If i can help in anyway, I’m here for you. I also have SLE,  but I’m primary Sjögren’s. We have a nice group of people here."
I massage my glands every day before I go to sleep and more often when they are particularly painful. It seems to be helping at least a bit.
Sometimes I need ice packs to stop the pain because it feels like someone is jackhammering my face
Thanks for the information. I will suggest this to my ENT. It would be incredible not to have swelling for 100 days.
Thank you. It means a lot coming from someone else who is going through it.
"Thanks. It's difficult to adjust to this new normal. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have SLE as well. I wish you the best outcomes with your treatments, and appreciate the advice."
I've been doing this the past few days and it helps a bit. Thanks for the suggestion!
"I'm glad I could help! Sjogren's sucks, and we have to help each other as much as possible :)"
Yeah this sounds pretty right on! I get the bloating too and it’s sometimes gone in the morning. I changed my whole diet. The worst to have with Sjogren’s is your menstrual cycle because it makes me 10x more tired and weak. This past weekend I came down with strep throat. Friday night I could not even swallow. Huge lump in my throat combined with severe dryness. It was terrible!!!!
"I've had Sjögren's Syndrome for decades, but it definitely doesn't follow any sort of daily pattern for me. Mine tends to evolve over weeks and months instead."
"I tend to have cold feet first, then hot and burning. My mornings tend to be alright and sometimes my late nights are as well."
"No official diagnosis yet but yes. I relate way too much to the ""there are red hot pokers in my eyes!"" And it burns when I take my eye drops that are supposed to help."

Except I sleep like the dead at night.. and still wake up exhausted feeling like I need about 2 more hours.
Abdominal edema as in bloating?
How did you change your diet?
"Mild ascites. Several inches in increased girth. By morning, it's completely gone and I drop 3-5lbs between bedtime and awakening without urinating. 🤷"
"I stopped eating processed foods like multi grain bars, muffins, all that crap this is GMO and man made. I cut out most carbs and things that contain gluten, which is alot. I had a real issue with sweets. I'm a recovered sweets addict! But, I noticed if I just stick to a diet of things like hard boiled eggs, tuna, meats, veggies, and sometimes a little bit of yogurt, almond milk, things like that I do not get bloated and have gas. I ate well for a month and over mother's day i had some things I haven't ate and was completely bloated with gas. Just stick to foods that come from the earth!"
My stomach is distended despite being slim as well idk why. And I can’t sleep until morning a lot too
I haven’t noticed anything worse than normal on Duloxetine.
I'm on good old Prozac and I have no side effects at all. But it's always a hit or miss..
My only side effect is the sweating. Lots and lots of sweating!
"Huh, I never made the connection between duloxetine and excess sweating. Thanks!"
"Sjögren's Syndrome is largely a case of treating symptoms, so I would suggest treating your dry eye with OTC eye drops."

"That said, there's no way for any of us to determine if you are in the process of developing it. I believe you and your symptoms. I encourage you to log them and, perhaps, seek a second opinion, particularly if they continue to exacerbate."

"I've had it for over 25 years and my experience is nothing like what you are describing with the exception of dry eye. I produce zero saliva upon salivary flow and volume testing. Despite my case being severe, I don't have neurological or muscle issues related to it. This doesn't mean that you don't have it. It took 17 years to receive my diagnosis through bloodwork. I know that it's difficult to be patient, so just treat yourself the best that you can in the meantime."
I have the same neurological issues and currently getting a work up by a neurologist who is familiar with sjogrens. I was diagnosed using the Sjö test. It’s an early sjögren test.
Hey! My blood tests never showed anything and lip biopsy was also inconclusive. My symptoms were so extreme and there was little something in the lip biopsy so I got the diagnosis.

I would highly suggest you to find another doctor to talk about these things.

I had to fight for many years to get the diagnosis so I know the struggle.
"Isn't Sicca aka Sjogrens?  Are you thinking you also have something else, or are you just thinking it's being mislabeled?"
What is CBD?  I am now being told by medical professions my conditions warrants no further investigation.  Only Mindfulness and sleep hygiene.  I am disgusted by all this.
You have the same issues?  For me it's unbearable.  I don't know what to do.

I'm a little tired of fighting.  How can I stop the parasthesia?
Thank you.

I don't know anymore.
CBD significantly reduced the amount and frequency of my spasms. I used xylitol products for sore dry mouth and badgerbalm for skin moisture.

You need a new Dr! Keep going until u get a satisfactory answer. This is nothing to play around with and earlier dx can sometimes prevent serious complications. Just insist on antibody testing and a lip biopsy.
I've had both.  No antibodies in blood and lip biopsy showed only some inflammation.  Meanwhile the nerve parasthesia stuff is so bad I don't know what to do.
I had a new doctor too.  He insists theres nothing they can do.
Well there are those tests designed for earlier detection. I’d just keep retesting annually until you have a positive Ana or more symptoms. I’m sorry so frustrating I know took me over 15 yrs
"I wasn't diagnosed when I breastfed my kids but I had trouble producing with all three and supplemented some but managed to breastfeed my first for 6 months, second for 2 years, and third for 1.5 years. I know breast is best but what's more important is fed is best. I put a lot of pressure on myself and stressed myself out way more than I should have. If I had to do it all over, I would have supplemented a lot earlier with all three and not stressed as much about it and accepted my body's limitations. Not to say you'll have the same issues, you may be one of the lucky ones where it's easy with no issues. I wanted to offer you encouragement and love and to offer advice from a three times mom. Do your best as long as it's good for you and baby and if you end up having to supplement and/or exclusively formula feed, that's completely ok."
"I produced milk, but not enough.   At my kids first doc visit (i believe a week our so after birth) I was told to supplement with formula, because my kid wasn’t gaining the right amount of weight."
I'm glad I didn't chose to breast feed because even after birth I didn't produce any milk ! 😢 I hope you get lucky and it works for you.
[deleted]
"I breastfed prior to my diagnosis but was symptomatic. No problems producing, two children breastfed for about a year each. I swear by oatmeal!"
I breastfed and was a little short on supply but nothing major. I was able to do it for six months. I barely got anything when I pumped but I did seem to produce enough for nursing sessions.  I had two lactation consultant sessions because I was concerned but all was well. We did do four ounces of formula before bedtime though.  Anyway I think it really depends on your body.
"I am currently breastfeeding and it’s been a little over three months. I breastfeed as much as the baby needs, and it’s definitely more than every 2-3 hours at times. I have noticed that around 3-4 months is when my supply starts to tank though. I’ve been hydrating as much as possible, but I know to start the transition to formula if my baby stops gaining weight. Supplementing causes my supply to tank, so the baby eventually refuses to breastfeed and wants the bottle."
"I wasn't diagnosed with Sjogrens til years after I had my son but I wish I had known I had it. I tried everything to breastfeed but couldn't produce but a few drops of milk. A specialist came to the house, friends kept saying it will come, etc. It was so depressing and frustrating. Made me feel inadequate. I finally stopped a few weeks in when I looked down at the breast pump and the container had tons of blood in it."
"I am only being ""monitored"" for Sjogrens at this time as I believe my markers fluctuate. I do deal with dryness, joint pain, and fatigue. That being said, I was able to BF fully for 6 months. After that, I supplemented but continued to BF as long as I could. We eventually stopped around 9 months. I don't think there is anything wrong with trying as long as you go into knowing you may have supply issues."
Thanks for the feedback. Did you continue to nurse while supplementing?
"That happened to me too, but I had hyperemesis gravidarum and we assumed it was due to malnutrition. We didn't suspect Sjogrens at that time."
That’s so sad. I’m sorry you went through that. Did they say that the other complications were due to the sjorens?
I was sympathetic for two years before getting a diagnosis. I still don’t have the antibodies thank god.
"Yes, you can definitely keep breast feeding while supplementing!! Honestly I tried it for a few weeks, but finally came to the personal decision that if I had to supplement, to make my life easier, I would just do formula."

I would have never thought that would by why for me!
I have Hashimoto's disease also and after both of my children my medication needed adjusted and I wasnt feeling well. Pregnancy and child birth is hard on the immune system when you have autoimmune diseases!
I also have hashimotos and was diagnosed with Sjogren's later on at 27. I didn't even realize anything was wrong. I went to a rheumy to ask about hashi's and some joint pain and fatigue that my thyroid meds weren't helping with.

"She said something like ""do you know you have Sjogren's?"" and I said ""no, I've never even heard of that before"". She was like, ""oh my gosh, you're like, textbook Sjogren's""...I have very obvious very dry skin but I thought my eyes and mouth were pretty normal. She did some tests and a lip biopsy later and that was that. I notice my symptoms a lot more now than I ever did before because the medicines made me feel so much better."

"My eyes were dry and often a little red, they would hurt some and go blurry in the afternoon. I think the mouth is probably more obvious - my tongue would often look dry or even cracked, and I could also see dents in it from my teeth like my tongue was swollen (they call this scalloped tongue if you want to look up pictures)."

Everyone is different though.
"I also have Hashimoto’s (and POTS, Endometriosis, adrenal gland insufficiency, blah blah blah)."
I was dxed with Sjögren’s relatively young age when I was 22 still in college. I was dxed with Hashimoto’s a few years after that. Endometriosis dxed after my first lap surgery in 2002 age 18 and had only been having a period for ONE year!

My main symptoms that led to a referral to a Rheumie were: fatigue/exhaustion and needing to sleep all the time when I wasn’t in class.

Muscle and joint pain along with cold hands and feet.

Random rashes and eczema since age 18.
Feeling cold all the time.

But overall the lack of energy and cognitive issues were the main symptoms. I had NEVER EVEN HEARD of
Sjögren’s until I was diagnosed.
"Wow, lucky you for having a doctor who will treat symptoms and not require lip biopsy when you are seronegative. I haven't tried salagen/pilocarpine because I started with evoxac/ cevimeline and have been happy with it. Each dose helps me for 5 hours. Might want to try switching to that and seeing if it works better than the salagen for you."

"Neuropathy can be the result of low vitamin B. Maybe try a quality B complex supplement before going to the neurologist. Also, my husband says exercise (walking or biking) helps reduce or eliminate his need for neuropathy meds."
yes I have autonomic and peripheral neuropathy.

I have had infrequent burnin toungue sensations.

You might. want to see a neurologist - preferable and autonomic neurologist if you are near one re: testing for neurological issues.
I have neuropathy from sjogrens and I am on a compounded supplement with all the B vitamins and zinc designed to reduce high copper levels . Recently I had to go off it for lab tests bc if the biotin for a month and oh boy my neuropathy became unbearable. I had no idea how much B vitamins actually cut my pain down. Definitely worth trying for those with neuropathy. It cuts my pain like 75%
I'll discuss the evoxac at my next appointment.

Thank you for the suggestions!
EMG is already scheduled. I'm not looking forward to it. That test is painful.

I hope you have found relief for your symptoms ❤️
just FYI  EMGs don't often pick up Peripheral neuropathies - best to get the  skin biopsy for that. I had EMG and after reading what people wrote here I was terrified but it wasnt that bad at all for me. I don't want one tomorrow but its wasnt as bad as I thought. I hope yours is non eventful like mine was.
"When I have my follow-up with the neurologist, I'll definitely bring it up. Thank you for the advice!"
Sounds very promising!  I will be asking my ophthalmologist about this next week.
"No, sounds like something I need to research. I'm having temp punctal plugs on Tuesday and I'm terrified. I do hope to get some relief. I am desperate right now!"
"I had these put in last week and it was really easy! Stung for a few seconds and then it just felt like I had something in my eye, but didn’t even notice they were there by the next day. I’ve been having severe dryness and they seem to be helping a bit so far. Good luck on Tuesday!"
"Don’t worry at all, takes literally 1 minute if the doc knows what they’re doing.  I had them every 3 months for a year and they offered immediate relief.  I’m using Xiidra now and haven’t had plugs for 6 months."
"Woo hoo! Happy to hear that, hope my experience is a good as yours. The dryness I'm experiencing is brutal and I can't wait to be free of drops, gels and oils in my darned eyes."
"I lost my sense of taste and smell right before Thanksgiving. It was bad enough to go to a ENT. He put me on prednisone and all my Sjogren's symptoms went away. My rheumatologist is trying to get me medication with the same anti-inflammatory properties without the negative side effects. Long term prednisone usage can affect your bones, and I already have osteoporosis."

Definitely bring it up at your appointment.
"I've noticed a slight loss in the taste of food, more a loss of the texture though. The worse one  is I can't taste the bubbles in fizzy drinks. I kept giving the kids into trouble for not putting the lid back on the bottles properly."
What is the medication called?
Thanks! I'll look into that medication you linked below. Sorry about the test results. =/
Yeah that sucks. Takes the pleasure out of simple things. I also like it when water tastes like saltwater.
"ACTH-AR. I got my test results back today and they were all negative, so it is looking less likely that I'll be getting it. Hope springs eternal, however."
There's a lot of overlap in symptoms and you can have both. I do.
"Yes. They are both B-cell mediated, humoral autoimmune diseases."
"My husband has both, and I just have sjogrens and hashimoto's. In his case, it's considered secondary to the lupus. In my case, it's a primary diagnosis, but not unrelated to my hashimoto's. Autoimmune conditions tend to come in pairs."

"Sjogrens for me comes with fatigue like you'd see with lupus, but not really any pain. That varies."
I have both.
I have both.
I have both. Sjogren's was diagnosed first. lupus years later.
I would call your dentist on this. I haven't had this but it is probably early decay or plaque building up. All of my teeth have been crowned due to sjogrens damage so I sympathize with you. Do you have a supportive dentist who is knowledgeable in this disease?
"I would definitely call the dentist on this. Hopefully it's just plaque, which she/ he can easily remove. My dentist told me that the plaque people with Sjogren's get is more tough than normal due to the lack of saliva,  so we have to brush a lot longer to avoid getting these brown spots."
"38 here and full dentures. Definitely tell your dentist your Sjogrens diagnosis, it saves time convincing them you’re not doing meth. It used to hurt to go outside in the cold and breathe so I can confirm that quality of life is improved so far with them. I have dentures over implants for the bottom and they’re really comfortable, I wish I had the same for the top but I can’t afford the bone  graft. My suggestion if you don’t have a dentist currently is to look into dental schools. They are the newest in techniques and they tend to be better on pricing."
"I have frequent problems to this effect and it's not fun. The last 4 times this has happened my teeth have shattered and have been removed, luckily all of them were molars but going to the dentist asap before anything worse happens is very important."
"My rheumys nurse said no Prednisone and that you don't get stained teeth from Sjogrens. I was like, do you really think I'm that stupid? I said I thought it was a stain and it's not it looked like my teeth are withering away, and they hurt. She said well Sjogrens doesn't cause your teeth to hurt. I said so you are telling me it's not true that lack of saliva can lead to dental decay? She said maybe over the course of years. I said well, I have complained about my eyes and trouble swalllowing and muscle pain etc for three years, and it was brushed off as my thyroid causing the trouble swallowing, and fibromyalgia causing the rest. Once I got that fibromyalgia diagnosis everything was chalked up to that, so who knows how long I've really had it? I can tell you more I have one completely red, swollen eye two years ago that did not even get quite better with antibiotics eyesdrops, so I'm pretty sure it could be possible that today is just the day I've noticed a change in my teeth, but I had to switch toothpastes about three months ago because of sensitivity. She said well the doctor said no Prednisone. I said okay then, bye. I think it's time for a new doctor. I thought she would atleast have given a little more insight on what to do for increase in symptoms. My rheumy honestly does kind of downplay peoples symptoms, he has some bad reviews and I can't wait to see my PCP next month. I live in an area that opiates have hit hard and even the dentists around here treat you as if you are seeking pain meds if you complain of mouth pain, so in the meantime I'll be making a dentist appointment...and making it clear I don't want no damn pain meds."
"My long time dentist retired, and I didn't like the place that I had my last cleaning done a few months ago. I'm looking for a new one. A friend of mine who is a dental assistant just told me to stop eating pineapple because it probably stripped the enamel off my teeth. I have been buying fresh pineapple and eating it because it helps with inflammation, this might actually be what happened, Xerstomia + Pineapple! I'm not so sure it's plaque because they feel so sensitive and painful. Its my two top teeth and two bottom teeth."
I told my mom if they get worse I'm getting all of them pulled.
"DEFINITELY time for a new rheumatologist.  I have Sjogren’s and RA. Over the last 10 years, my teeth and eyes have gone to shit. I broke my two front teeth eating Swedish Fish! I have, in addition to the two front veneers, almost all of my back teeth crowned. My mouth and throat get so dry it feels like they’re stuck together. I always have a drink or some gum, but you can’t do that when you’re asleep. I keep my cool mist humidifier aimed at my head."

"Maybe when you’re looking for a new dentist you can frame it with, “I have Sjogren’s Syndrome, which can contribute to significant dental complications. I’m looking for a provider that’s familiar with it and is comfortable with the challenges it can pose.”"

"As far as eyes, I’ve been on Xiidra for a couple of years for dry eye, and it’s really helped. My eyes would get red and watery, and feel like they were covered in paper cuts. The idea of dry eye made no sense to me, but apparently they get so dry that you’re overproducing tears. My overall vision has tanked, but stabilized, I hope."
Have you tried Salagen or Evoxac prescribed by rheumatologist or dentist to help saliva production? It helps clean teeth and prevent bacteria. Bonus is sometimes side effect is increased tear production.
My insurance doesn't cover it but I have sought fake teeth drilled into my skull for 9 years now. It's utterly crushing to be eating a piece of chicken or a slice of bread and have a tooth shatter because the condition has destroyed my mouth.

"If you can I advise it, the quality of life you would get from it would be a much needed peace of mind."
"Before I got my diagnosis, I was brushing off dry eyes as allergies. The earliest I can remember buying lubricating drops was four years ago. I got diagnosed in October. Last year around this time I went to the ER for what I thought was the flu. I think it was really a flare up, because I had no real respiratory symptoms. Misdiagnosed pink eye. I was even buying cold meds and allergy eye drops, that did not help at all! Then finally made a connection that my muscles hurt and felt weak when my eyes were bright red and irritated and accompanied with a headache. I really thought a few times I was on the verge of dying of a brain aneurysm. Then my vision got blurry. I lost feeling in my left foot for two months. On some days I need my glasses and other days I don’t. It’s strange! Last time I had a nervous breakdown my conjunctiva blew up like a blister, but it went back down after I took a nap. This is the worst!!!! But, it is nice to feel like we aren’t alone and I am so happy to have found people like me to talk to."

"No and at my disability hearing today I was told my rheumy refused to even confirm my diagnosis when my doctor has. I'm not sure what else he is trying to rule out? But the blood tests spoke clear as day. Maybe he feels there is a chance I have another underlying condition, as he has not yet ruled out Lupus. I need some help here cause sometimes I feel like I know water cause my mouth is dry, or my mouth is dry but I mistake it for build up on my tounge and I'm brushing my teeth multiple times a day."
"Oh my Lord. I'm so sorry to hear this. Thats terrible! I'm all for getting them pulled honestly, if this gets worse. My insurance will only cover dentures. Im only 31, this sucks. My one friend just had to get them because four pregnancies ruined her teeth and hers actually look great. My moms side has weak, cavity prone teeth and I inherited them. I have two brothers who have perfect teeth like my dad, no cavities ever. Me, I have a mouth full of fillings, and two molars I had pulled. My front teeth are the only nice white teeth I have so I’m pretty bummed!"
Xiidra works amazing for me but it’s too expensive. Way better than anything OTC and better than Restasis too.
Get your 30-day prescription for as little as $5 (up to $250 in savings each month).

Patients with a 90-day prescription pay as little as $15 for each fill (up
to $750 in savings per fill).

"If you pay $260, it looks like your script will cost you $10"

https://www.xiidra.com/savings


Get the coupon Xiidra offers. I pay $5 per refill (I have Regence Federal)

IMO it's the best drop for dry eye.
"Xiidra is amazing. I was plagued by worsening light sensitivity (and migraines)—my opthamalogist discovered my lactimal glands had stopped producing tears. (I had a Systane addiction because Systane wasn’t doing anything except making the dryness worse—I had no idea there was anything better available.). She prescribed Xiidra. Within 10 days the redness was gone (my eyes actually changed color from dark blue to blue-green because the inflammation eased) and within 2.5 weeks, my eyes stopped burning all the time."

"In terms of price: it’s $516/dose (approx $30k/month). After insurance, I pay $26/month."

The manufacturer offers several programs if you don’t have insurance/aren’t covered.

"Highly recommend. Xiidra has been life changing. My light sensitivity was so bad I was having migraines 20+ days each month and came close to having to file for disability and quit my job. Since Xiidra, I get a migraine 3 days each month—I have a job and don’t worry about having to quit anymore. (3 days is manageable. 20 plus days are not.)"
"It looks like I am the lone person that it did not work for. Originally I had a great response with increased tear production. However, within six weeks they went back to being very dry. My eye doctor said for some people this happens. I was so disappointed. It was also very expensive."
"thanks for all the replies in this thread, very informative and happy to see it works for a lot of you. i knew there was a coupon for it and without it is super expensive. i don't even know if my insurance covers it even though i have the best insurance i can get."
Insurance plus discount card (from Xiidra that I picked up from doctor) make it $5/month for me. (60 doses)
Doesn’t sound like you work for them at all
The 260 includes the savings from xiidra plus insurance unfortunately
Try goodrx.com and also Costco. You don't have to be a member of Costco to use the pharmacy.
"I did four sets of infusions (once a week for four weeks) and at the end of it I felt normal again, like I could go back to work and get off disability. However, three weeks after the last infusion all my symptoms came back and I felt worse than I did before I got them (I'm back to a normal level of crappy now and that took about 4-5 months to get to)."

"I was prescribed Rituxan when I had a LEMS (Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome) diagnosis in addition to my Sjogren's diagnosis, but the use was considered off-label for that and wasn't covered by insurance. Fortunately for me Medicare blamed the hospital for not getting prior approval so it didn't cost me anything (the original $150,000 bill gave me heart failure!)."

"Please make sure the treatment is covered and find out how much it will cost you before you get them. I wish I could've continued with it, but at probably $38K per infusion it just isn't an option for me."

Good luck to you.
"I’m supposed to start it next Friday for RA. I did a round of it last year, but I was in the middle of changing doctors and the new one said once was enough to see if there was any improvement. Apparently, that is not the case, and I’m finally back with my original rheumatologist."

"I did have a bad allergic reaction of itching and welts/hives the first time. I took Benadryl & Zantac twice a day for 10 days before attempting it again and was fine. I want to say as far as time, there were either six or eight 15-minute increments where the IV machine beeps and the nurse adjusted the dosage."

"I also have Sjogren’s, so maybe it will help with that as well. I have been off my Orencia for 3 weeks and am feeling it. As far as cost, according to the BCBS website, my cost was going to be about $4900 this time. However, I do have a copay card, and my actual cost will be $5. If I remember correctly, copay cards are only good with commercial insurance (Aetna, Cigna, etc.) not Medicare/Medicare. Last year, I remember the overall cost was $25,000 per infusion, and my insurance covered it 100%, so I didn’t need a copay card. But, that meant I got no credit towards my out of pocket maximum, so that sucked."
"Thank you so much for your response. I'm very sorry to hear about your LEMS diagnosis. And even sorrier to hear that can't continue with the treatment because of the cost. That makes me sad. I know I'm very lucky to have good insurance, but my doctor is going to check to see if my insurance will cover it."

How long did it take to get the infusions? Was it something you that would have been a maintenance medication if you had been to continue? Did you have any side effects?

Good luck to you as well!
"Thanks for your response! From what I can tell (or maybe read here, all the information is starting to blend together) that it can take three months to feel the full benefits of Rituxan. Did they give you the IV of Benedryl before starting Rituxan?"

It's supposed to be really helpful for Sjogren's from what I can tell. I sure hope it is!

Thanks again! Take care of yourself!
"Apparently to Medicare Rituxan isn't an authorized treatment for LEMS (which they now don't believe I actually have). I have no idea if it is considered an ""on label"" treatment for Sjogren's. I'd like to believe that my rheumatologist would prescribe it if it is an on-label treatment, since he's actively seeking a treatment for me."

"The actual infusions took a few hours each, and I don't really recall any side effects. My PCP was hoping that it would act as a ""reset"" of my immune system, versus being something that I'd have to repeat. It was a long shot, and even she'd admit that whatever ails me is well outside of her area of expertise (but she's trying!). I would've been willing to repeat the treatments for maintenance. The improvement was dramatic, I will say that."
"My rheum told me it would take at least 3-4 months and two rounds to be sure it was working. They gave me Benadryl and a load of some steroid prior to starting the rituxan the first time, and still had the reaction. I’m almost sorry I didn’t get to see it, because everyone that saw **me** freaked out. They administered even more Benadryl and steroid with a bag of fluid. I was fine to go after an hour. In fact, I even did my traditional Five Guys cheeseburger afterwards. It started with colonoscopies, now infusions. Something to look forward to."
"Coming back to say I had my infusion today. I did do my pregame Benadryl and Xanax, but only had time for 8 days. I started to have the itchy eardrum reaction, had an additional bolus of Benadryl and steroids. They restarted, but very slowly, and didn’t up it for a while. I thought that bag would NEVER EMPTY. When it did, my nurse cheered, which was really sweet. I had to stay hooked up to saline to flush me out, and be observed, for another hour, SIX in all."

"No other ill effects, 10/10 will do again in 2 weeks."
Popping in on your convo. A lot of pharmaceutical companies provide financial assistance. Have you tried contacting Genentech about its Rituxan Patient Assistance Programs? https://www.rituxan.com/patient/resources/rituxan-patient-assistance.html
"Auto-immune diseases are so frustrating, aren't they? It can take years to figure out a diagnosis and then months on top of that to get the medications and dosages correct."

Thanks for answering my questions. I'm happy to hear the improvement was dramatic.
Itchy eardrums? That's sounds horribly irritating. Very glad to hear it went so well!
"I haven't, but I will certainly check it out."

"Edit: after looking at the website it looks like the only on-label uses are for lymphoma, which I don't have."
"Ah, bummer. Didn't read the details before posting. Also indicated for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegener’s Granulomatosis), Microscopic"
"Polyangiitis, and Pemphigus Vulgaris, but maybe you don't have any of those, either. https://www.gene.com/download/pdf/rituxan_prescribing.pdf"
"No, unfortunately."
"A few other things that you can have done that could make a case for it being Sjögren's Syndrome are a) Schirmer's eye test, b) saliva flow and volume test, and c) salivary gland ultrasound. My rheumatologist performs all of these right in her office. That said, without positive antibodies, you are going to need the lip biopsy. Of course, diagnosis doesn't really change anything since symptoms are treated and Plaquenil is pretty useless."
"I had negative antibodies despite sicca syndrome (dry eyes nose throat vagina), did the lip biopsy, had a positive result. I’m happy I did it simply for the validation. I felt like my physicians took me and my treatments more seriously because of the diagnosis."
"I was only diagnosed through the lip biopsy (a plastic surgeon from the local medical school performed my procedure). My antibody tests are persistently negative. It is worth it if you want to know for sure. In my case it seemed like it took forever for the lump inside my mouth to go away, but one day it just wasn't there anymore. I had no complications."
"The only thing that has ever helped with my dry eyes was to get all my tear ducts plugged. It’s a very easy and fast operation. I used to had to put gel eye drops around five times per hour, now I don’t need any eye drops. My eyes are leaking all the time though, but it’s much better than the constant horrible dryness."

"Also, my blood tests never showed anything. I got diagnosed after a lip biopsy."
Fasting for 6 weeks helped my symptoms immensely.

I've read a lot about how a 3-4 day fast is good for resetting the immune system (killing it off)

"I was a mess during the fast, but I did notice that a lot of problems went away."

No clue if this is helpful or not
I am so sorry to hear about the dryness getting worse.

I was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disorder many years ago but have been able to manage it without medications.

"I recently wrote an [article](https://vitalityjuicer.com/dry-eye/) about dry eye and what helped me, you might find it useful too."

Hope you get relief soon.
"I had Schirmer's test and saliva flow test, they were both positive. My doc said it showed objective dryness, but couldn't be used for diagnosing Sjogren's, as it doesn't confirm the dryness to be auto-immune. I haven't had the ultrasound though."

"I know dryness is treated just the same, no matter the origin...which sucks. But I guess having my dry syndrome being confirmed as ""auto-immune"" could have explained some other things: my ongoing fever, joint pain, neuro issues, etc. My TSH is slightly high, so maybe this has to do with it, I'm not sure."
And the Sjö test!
"Thank you for the info! It motivates me even more now, I need to get that lip biopsy!"



"It's nice to know! I am not sure plastic surgeons do it where I live, my doctor said the ENT would do it. Not sure what to think..."
"I am glad I made this post, it proves you can have negative antibodies, but still have SS!"

"I am seeing my eye doctor in a few months, I'll ask him about the punctal plugs then."
"I hear you and totally understand. It took 17 years for me to receive a Sjögren's diagnosis, but I hadn't even heard of it at that point. I have type one diabetes, so I never mentioned dryness at all, assumed that it was blood sugar related."

"Anyhow, a diagnosis is so validating. You deserve that. Plus, with autoimmune diseases often coming in clusters, it would be helpful to know for sure so that your doctors can watch for comorbidities.  Was your TSH not high enough for a Hashimoto's diagnosis or empirical treatment? I have Hashimoto's, as well, and it shouldn't cause the symptoms that you describe... mostly just low energy, coldness, alligator skin."

What about that other Sjögren's panel that they can run... I don't know what it's called since it's a rather recent thing. It likely can't be used for diagnosis either.

"I'm so sorry that you are struggling. I haven't had a lip biopsy, so I certainly understand trepidation over having one, if that's how you feel. No doubt that ANA is indicative of something. I don't doubt that you likely have Sjögren's Syndrome."

"I hope that someone more knowledgeable about a seronegative diagnosis comes along to provide insight. Meanwhile, you are doing the right thing... persevering and advocating for yourself. 🖤"

Edit: I think that it's worth getting the biopsy. You deserve resolution.
"There are other ways! That lip biopsy is a beast, and can be difficult to heal from! Call around and find an opthalmologist that can do the [Sjö](https://ard.bmj.com/content/75/Suppl_2/557.1) test. That can help narrow it down without the pain and recovery time. You'll probably need an opthalmologist, anyway, so you'll be ahead of the game!"
"See the doctor and if she/he seems like a reasonable person who takes you seriously, then that is a point in their favor."
Thank you for your kind response <3 It's really nice to come across understanding people.

"I'm sorry you have three auto-immune diseases, it must be really though to deal with :("

"My blood test results are fresh, so I haven't had the chance to talk to my doctor since. My TSH is 5.37, so I am not sure it is considered that abnormal, or even treatable. I believe I was prescribed this test to explain my heavy period; which last 10 days at a time, sometimes twice a month. I have been diagnosed by iron deficiency anemia last year, my HB was down to 9, and I was out of breath constantly. I am still undergoing iron IV treatment at the moment, as my HB is still low (11.1). I am not sure if the ""excessive bleeding"" has an auto-immune/hormonal component, but the doctor surely needs to find the cause, as I keep losing my iron."

"I do have a lot of the hypothyroidism symptoms, but my T3 and T4 are normal."

"I will get the lip biopsy, now I just need to find the right person to do it. It's probably not going to be fun, but at least I'll know for sure! :)"

Thank you again :)



I am not even sure they do the Sjo test where I live :( I am not in North America...
"I found a place near Seattle, but that's a 1000 miles away.  Hard to find."

"Make sure you see a doctor ASAP about this, it sounds like some kind of neuropathy."

"I got my Sjorgren's diagnosis (I'm also male, btw) in the midst of trying to figure out what was causing my neuropathy. It was the last long shot test (after so, so many others), and my rheumatologist still thinks its not directly related. Its specifically ""small fiber neuropathy"", which is where something (maybe the same mechanism that's attacking your saliva glands and tear ducts, maybe something else, like heavy metal poisoning or chemotherapy) is damaging the fibers in your body that don't have a myelin (its a kind of fatty tissue) sheath. It starts in your hands and feet, and can eventually affect all sorts of things - the small fiber nerves are involved in touch and sensation of temperature and pain, but also digestion, sexual response, sweating, and regulating your blood pressure when you sit/stand and more I can't recall off the top of my head (this is generally called ""dysautonomia"", worth reading up on in case you have other symptoms)."

"If you want, I can get into what worked or didn't for me, but its really important you see a doctor and rule out any other causes. Especially if this is a new symptom that is developing."

"If it is indeed small fiber neuropathy, then its good news to an extent - small fiber nerves can regrow, unlike other kinds. So once you control whatever's causing the damage, the problems subside. There's also a tendency for small fiber neuropathy to progress to the longer nerve fibers over time, so its really important to get it checked, and don't take any crap from the doctors if they have trouble finding a cause. If for some reason they don't believe you are in pain, ask for a nerve conduction test (these can be inconclusive but their non-invasion), or a skin punch biopsy."

"Please keep in touch and let me know what happens (feel free to PM me if you want). My neuropathy has gotten worse over the past 8 or so years since it started, and all of the treatments I've tried so far have been pretty useless."
"Practically speaking, Maximum Strength Aspercream is helpful, and, odd as it may sound, Vick’s VapoRub. Aspercream has lidocaine, a topical numbing agent, and Vick’s is an analgesic. If my budget can’t buy one, I can usually afford the other. Hope this helps."
"Are you getting enough magnesium and potassium? Have you tried bananas, magnesium sprays, Epsom salt baths? Is it like a restless feeling?"
"My doctor and any doctor I've seen isn't interested.  They said there's nothing they can do.  I've seen lots of doctors over the year and this has been the most useful.  He just shrugs.  He won't prescribe naproxen or anything much except for antihistamines.  My job is in the balance, I've lost my Spanish love, and I'm at a loss.  I know my GP will refuse any test.  They say I've got some autoimmune probably and that's that."
Can it be reversed?
Nothing worked for you?
My doctor refuses to believe it's neuropathy.  He calls it parasthesia but did a test with a needle etc and ruled out neuropathy.
Hello hope you're ok.

&#x200B;

I had a neurology test at the hospital (the electro conductive test) and it has revealed nothing.  I told them that the advice is that these tests are unrevealing with smal fibre neuropathy according to many sources.  I was laughed out the building pretty much.  The Neurologist says there is no cause for concern with what i'm suffering and the GP concurs.  I had a lip biopsy for the Sjogrens.  It has left me with a very uncomfortable aching sensation that hasn't gone away (again nobody believes this).  The results are inconclusive and I have been given the diagnosis of Sicca Syndrome instead.   I am no further forward with anything.
I can't put in Vicks and go out in public or to work.  I have to use a numbing agent? :( omg
"It's twitching, spasms in the muscles.  Tingling, pins and needles, itching feeling.  This is on top of the other issues I've experienced since just over a year ago.  I've seen a Rheumatologist and they said I'm dry.  Nothing in my bloods.  I've started magnesium tablets but maybe I'm not getting enough.  I'm frightened, especially with neuropathy."

Thanks
I agree is sounds like neuropathy. Have you been to a neurologist?
"Nope. Managing this kind of pain is really hard. The best thing I did was go through pain management and occupational therapy to learn how to pace myself and adapt to my limitations. Soft socks, always covering my arms (usually a super soft hoodie), velcro shoes, walking with a cane. Stopping any activity *before* the pain gets too bad. If I stick to that, things are at least bearable."

"I'm also moving to a warmer climate (literally today we're packing up right now) - I've noticed the winters have been harder and harder on me each year. The pain and fatigue seems to always get worse after winter, especially if its been particularly cold. So we'll see what happens."

"But you have to try to get to the bottom of what's causing it, there's serious potential - if you can treat the underlying issue, the pain will most likely go away (or at the least, stop progressing). There are all sorts of weird, treatable disorders that can cause neuropathy, like hyperlipidemia for example."
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** JohnnyZenith! ^(hug)
This is what I have found personally helps me. I use Vick’s at night. Shower in the AM.

I can’t speak for a general population.

I do wish you well.
"I was looking over the document where I keep my autoimmune regimen to send to someone in another sub, and I noticed that I started eating more sweet potatoes a few years ago to relieve itching - a friend of mine had found out from her doctor that it might be related to a beta carotene deficiency. Just another thing to try. I hope you get some relief!"
No my doctors have constantly refused and just say nothing can be done.  I had to argue with a new doctor to get him to do a rudimentary test in a weeks time at the practice.  I no longer believe in doctors.
Thank you.
"Yes, you can have Sjögrens without a positive on the blood test.  When I first started seeing my rheumy, I had a negative on my blood test, but my diagnosis was probable Sjögrens.  Now after seeing my rheumy for a few years my diagnosis is  that I have Sjögrens (no question).  Good luck!"
"I see a rheumatologist who specializes in Sjögren's Syndrome, but her evaluations are about a lot more than joint symptoms. I've been diagnosed for many years, but during my first visit, she did other diagnostic testing, such as measuring saliva flow and volume and doing an ultrasound of my salivary glands. She wanted to do a Schirmer's eye test, but my eyes were too dry. So, those are other avenues that a rheumatologist could explore for you. An ophthalmologist could do the eye test, as well."
You don't need to have joint pain to see a rheumatologist. And your lack of fatigue and dry skin is totally irrelevant -- you *do* have the two primary Sjogren's symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth).

"In my case, my PCP checked my RF and SSA/B. The results were all indicative of Sjogren's, so she referred me to a rheumatologist who ran some additional tests to rule out other diagnoses. That's the route I would encourage you to go (PCP first) because seeing a specialist like a rheumatologist can have a long wait and a higher pricetag."

"FYI, no, ""standard blood tests"" (assuming you mean a CBC or a chem panel) do not usually include the tests you need to dx autoimmune issues."
I’d see a gp or an internist. Share all your symptoms with them and they’ll do some tests that may help you find the right specialist.
"Advanced Sjogren's can cause tooth erosion. I have it pretty bad, so bad in fact that while eating a turkey sandwich the other day I shattered a molar and now need to have it pulled. This is after all of my crowns fell out last year around Thanksgiving. The only thing I can suggest is that you focus on things that strengthen enamel as a whole and be prepared for many dentist visits. It doesn't get better, it just get's easier to deal with as you build a routine around it."
"I felt my crown lift a bit last month when I ate a gummy bear (yeah, not the brightest move) so I went in the next week to get it checked out. Don't want to let that go too long because if remaining tooth underneath goes bad you could be looking at a root canal. He removed the crown and found some liquid underneath from crown being a little loose. The tooth underneath was still good so dentist just cleaned the area and cemented the crown back on. Cost more money than my husband's filling the same day, but better than having to get a root canal so I was happy."

I hope all goes well with yours. Good luck!

"ETA: If you call dentist and tell receptionist your crown fell off, they'll probably fit you in pretty quickly as opposed to the amount of time it might take to get in when scheduling a regular maintenance appointment."
You can buy over the counter glue to work until you get to a dentist. Or maybe call your dentist (they should have an emergency line) and ask if it’s okay first.

"I have severe Sjogrens and no matter how much I brush, floss, get cleanings etc, I have had horrible problems with my teeth. I’m 33 and most of my molars are gone and I have one bridge. I need implants but I have little bone in my jaw to do them...not to mention the money it costs."

I freaking hate Sjogrens. I have also lost my sense of smell 4 years ago because of it and go through a bottle (without exaggeration) of eye drops a week.
They can recement it.
"To your point, it has nothing to do with your oral hygiene, it's just one of those byproducts of having Sjogren's."

"My dentist explained that with Sjogren's, your mouth doesn't produce enough saliva, and that enables the bacteria to decay your teeth. I've been advised to gurgle, brush and floss after every meal, and to get teeth cleanings every 3 months to help combat any decay. My dentist also gave me professional sealant to use at home when I can't get into her office, to help make sure there is no further decay."

"Is your dentist aware of your condition, and if not, perhaps you can find a provider that knows how to work with Sjogren's patients?"
"Mine fall out too. I have a few teeth that the crowns just will not stick to—your teeth break down under the crowns and then the crowns just don’t want to stick anymore. Call your dentist, they may or may not put it back on. I have a dentist (who did not seat my crowns) who will glue them back on for me."
It is so frustrating and can be so expensive. For preventative care I get four units of scaling every three months. X-rays twice per year and just spent $1000 on replacing my fillings to prevent secondary cavities.

All to at best slow the rate of deterioration in my mouth.
"I'm lucky to live in a college town with a dental school that has a clinic. The quality of care is extremely good, the students are bright and very courteous. The costs are super low. I also dropped a lot of money this year on some work before I got back into the clinic, and went to a really talented dentist and oral surgeon that I liked a lot... I still had a better experience with the students. I may be moving away soon but even if I get insurance I think I may still travel so I can keep going."

"The downsides are that its a lottery, so you aren't guaranteed care, you need the money up front (no insurance, no payment plans, but they do take credit cards), you need to set aside 3+ hours for each visit, and they have to find your case interesting enough (for those of us with Sjorgren's that have tooth issues, that doesn't seem to be too difficult). Oh and they're super flexible about appointments, but you do have to work around the student's clinic time. There's an emergency clinic if you break a tooth or something, but basically all summer you're SOL."
"My teeth have definitely been worse because of the dry mouth. I don't have dental insurance, but do the twice-yearly cleanings to spot trouble before it gets too bad. There are mouthwashes that are supposed to help with dry mouth, but didn't help me. You can also have salivary and parotid gland issues with this. I had a parotid gland clog, and it swelled up unbelievably fast. Now I keep lemon drops around, just in case."
"I have had the same problem. Thousands and thousands of dollars at the dentist, dentist after dentist because I thought I was getting ripped off before I was diagnosed. I got my credit score up and applied for a care credit card and got all new teeth tops and bottoms... you would not believe how nice it is to never feel tooth pain or have to crew on one side. It’s super expensive but I couldn’t be happier. I am going to start a small savings for if I need them replaced later on in life. I’m a 34W. I love my smile now. No more chipped holes in my teeth and best of all no more pain."
"The post says there are already twelve comments, but for some reason I can only see three. Hopefully I'm not repeating too much of what others have already said."

Extra stuff to do to prevent dental problems:
"1. Get a prescription for Evoxac, Salagen or their generic equivalent from rheumatologist or dentist. They are meds that helps with saliva production. Saliva helps keep teeth clean."
2. Swish and drink water frequently.
"3. Use dry mouth mouthwash, mouth spray and/or lozenges, all of which can be found in oral section of drugstores."
4. Chewing gum helps produce saliva. Sugarless is best.
"5. Get teeth cleaned at least twice per year. I also get fluoride treatment after each cleaning.  My dentist also offered prescription fluoride gel, but I don't want to brush my teeth with that each time after regular brushing because I'm concerned about receding gums (already have a little bit)."
"6. Reduce or eliminate consumption of sugary and acidic foods and drinks, and hard food."
"7. Brush teeth at least twice per day and floss at least once per day, but you probably already know that.  :)"
"My dentist has me getting a cleaning every 3 months due to dental decay from dry mouth. She also said that chewing  gum helps activate the salivary glands - just make sure to go with sugar free. Brushing after every meal is a must, since you don't have as much saliva to keep the food off your teeth."

"She's also provided me with tooth sealant to use when I'm traveling or can't get in to the office, to help prevent my teeth from getting cavities. Maybe your dentist can do the same?"

It becomes expensive but there's really no good alternative.
I’m 28 and I’ve all ready lost all of my teeth. After years of paying money I didn’t have and being asked if I did meth I finally needed to have them pulled. I will be getting my permanent dentures by the end of January after a year of temporary ones and a decade of work trying to save the teeth. About 30 grand (that’s a fraction of 100grand of work they did) I will almost be done. If I want to get the set they want me to have though I would have to raise like 50 grand more so I’ll just be happy to say DONE for a while. They didn’t diagnose my Sjogrens until 6mos before I had the remaining teeth removed 🤷🏻‍♀️
Are you concerned about the experience of having the biopsy itself or scared more of having Sjogrens?

&#x200B;

"Having Sjogrens, I can tell you, there are worse things to have.  I'm thankful actually."
[deleted]
Lip biopsy wasn’t bad at all. Your lip will be swollen for few days and you will look like you’re half a duck and that’s it. If you get an infection they will give antibiotics and it’s solved. I was also scared as hell for the operation but it was even an okay experience. My lip was a bit numb for six months after but now it’s fully normal.🦆
Lots of things cause dry mouth. Is your only symptom dry mouth?

"I had a lip biopsy and it was no big deal at all. It was done on the inside part of my mouth, not on the part people see."
"Lip Biopsy wasn't scary for me but it was fking painful after the first hour when i had to drive home from LA. I would ask for more pain meds, no joke. that car ride home was difficult in LA traffic."
"I did not have any numbness, infection, or complication from my lip biopsy. Once completed, my dr showed me my result then and there and pronounced Sjögren’s. I don’t recall swelling. I recall soreness. I ate ice cream."

I was very scared. It was wasted energy.
"No i am not scared of having Sjorgens , there is nothing i can do if i have it so there is nothing to be scared of  , i am scared of the biopsy and more importantly the long term effects it may have on me (damaging the nerves etc )."
>ETN checked my salivary glands and said they are working fine but not tests were made.

&#x200B;
6 months damn !  I still don't know how i feel about  .
>Yes dry mouth/ sore throat is my only symptom.
Yea but i read it can cause permanently nerve damage.  Your lips are swollen for weeks  and it can take up to 6 months for them to get back to normal.

How long did it pass for you not to feel anything from the surgery at all ?
I honestly had no idea there could be any long term effects.  Just read about lip biopsies and possible side effects ... :O I had no idea.   I think you have every right to be nervous.  Maybe even consider not getting the biopsy?  Maybe suggest medication for Sjogrens first (hydroxychloroquine).  If it helps your symptoms it would be a good indication that you have it.

My doctor put me on medication before being certain (my blood markers showed a positive result but he wasn’t convinced).
"Well, it was just the right side of my lower lip. A little spot, not like my whole lips. They do the operation in a very little specific spot."
"I mean, my lips have been numb for six years... That's one of my symptoms!"
"I'm a little surprised that the doctors want to test you for lymphocytic infiltrate in your saliva glands - I would expect that you'd need a few more Sjogren's symptoms (dry eye, arthritis, fatigue, brain fog) before they'd seriously consider a Sjogren's diagnosis. But, I haven't seen any research that says Sjogren's can't manifest as only dry mouth."
"I would not do an invasive biopsy, especially if your other test were negative. Sjogren’s is an auto immune disease that attacks your moisture producing glands and reeks havoc on your body. Not to say you can’t have Sjogren’s with just dry mouth and a sore throat, just to say I don’t think those two symptoms are worth going through a biopsy for. But that’s just my .02c"
Have you ruled out a food issue? Anything new going on? How long have you had the symptoms? How sore is your throat? I’m not a doc but I have 8 disorders and spent time in groups so I know a little about a lot lol.
Here is a grouping of Sjögren’s symptoms from the internet
Pain areas: in the joints or muscles
"Sensory: abnormality of taste, loss of taste, or pins and needles"
"Mouth: dental cavities, dryness, or ulcers"
Speech: hoarseness or impaired voice
Throat: difficulty swallowing or dryness
"Also common: dry cough, dry eyes, dry skin, fatigue, joint stiffness, stiffness, swollen lymph nodes,"
Glad I didn't read that in advance.  To me it was more like a dental appointment except in my ENTs office. He just pulled down my lower lip a little.   I asked to see the saliva glands as soon as he cut them out.  I don't remember the numbness being longer than I  expected compared to the dentist. It was a bit sore at the removal location and was a great excuse to get ice cream. I probably avoided salty food like nachos for a while.
"No clue what to do at this point my friend , i have seen 2 pathologist , 3 ETN , 2 dentists and one  gastroenterologist  . I did like 20 tests already  and everything is fine with my health .  I have no clue what to do at this point so i am just eliminating every outcome . About the lip biopsy i am still unsure if i am going to do it ."
Hey thank you for your reply . It's been 1.5 year now and it's 24/7 and in the mornings way worst.  I went to a gastroenterologist because my stomach feels full all the time for no reason and it started the same time my sore throat started but he said that i am fine and it's prob the stress .  How would i go about searching about food ? I mean it's been 1.5 year i've been through eating healthy and nothing.
How long did the numbness last ? I have a job interview in 24 hours after the surgery .
"Not sure if this helps, but if I was in your position, I would absolutely do it."
"How are your bowels? You don’t need to tell me lol but if you feel full for no reason maybe it’s a food sensitivity. My Sjögren’s came on after Xyrem, a narcolepsy med, turned my saliva to salt. My tongue was like a potato chip. After that meds all gave me horrific side effects so I turned to food. I watched Minding Your Mitochondria on YouTube and thought, if she can push her MS into remission with food, maybe I can at least get some relief. It helped but not enough, I went autoimmune paleo and within 60-90 days I’d dropped 15 symptoms. The idea is to avoid anything that might be aggravating for at least 45 days, then reintroduce things one at a time. Six months after I started I ate a red bell pepper and got bloated angina so bad I thought I was having a heart attack. Kvass (homemade probiotic) helped me recover and I’ve avoided nightshade ever since. Food with gums or citric acid give me bloaty gas that travels up into my shoulders and activated my fibro triggers. It wouldn’t hurt to try. Honestly, even if you just start with kvass and see what happens, at the very least it should help your stomach. Search YouTube for how to. It takes a couple days wait cuz it’s fermented but it helps fairly quickly."
"I spent 11 years undiagnosed with narcolepsy. Had it 37 years now. Had to spell some of my disorders for physicians and explain how to read test results to a board certified neuro. When you got weirdness going on, it’s best to not rely solely on docs but to try your own (safe, healthy, affordable, reasonable) things too."
I don't remember.
"How did it go , did u tested positive ? I just want this sore throat to go the fuck away."
"My bowels are good i just feel a sensation that my stomach is full right after every meal but it doesnt bother me at all , if i am out or have something to do i completely forget about it . My sore throat on the other hand is terrible it's on 24/7 and i am thinking about it constantly . I think i will go on with the biopsy i need to give an end to this , it just bothers and affects my life for way too long . I want to get treatment so i feel normal again , i am just 24 years old . Thank you so much for your reply it helps more than you know."
"No, I didn't test positive. I literally have every single Sjogren's symptom (dry eye, dry mouth, fatigue, arthritis, brain fog, sleep issues), but none of the positive bloodwork."

"This exists, and it's called seronegative Sjogren's syndrome, but even that is only a tentative diagnosis for me."
"For sure. Go on with the biopsy but as sore throat 24/7” is not even a symptom of Sjögren’s, and you have zero other Sjögren’s symptoms, I would not stop looking. Just a few mins searching online indicates your problem is probably in your stomach. I know it seems weird that the stomach affects the throat but yeah. Best of luck to you."
Sore throat as well ?

Is there a treatment that makes you feel normal again? I really want to get back on drinking coffee and beers without thinking my throat .  Thanks for you reply.
"I don't have sore throat, and it's my understanding that many people with Sjogren's do not get sore throat."

"No, unfortunately I have not found anything that helps me feel normal."

I hope you find out what's causing your sore throat and are able to cure it.
"I would suggest that you see a rheumatologist. Sjogren's is often seen in connection with other autoimmune illnesses that has some of the symptoms you describe, and it would be smart to rule out any other problems or get the right treatment if it turns out that you've got something else going on too."
"I have the same symptoms but to a lesser degree and I don't treat mine like most. I have never used prescription medications. I take natural supplements, eat healthy-ish, lift weights, do cardio a couple times a week, practice yoga when I feel the need, and make sure I get plenty of sleep. I recently upgraded my probiotic and that has helped with some of the worsening symptoms. I also take CBD oil for a different disorder and that seems to have also helped  with pain associated with SS . I'm considering a naturopath but my financial situation isn't quite ready for that yet."

"When I have a flare up that I can't get under control I take a round of steroids. That's about once a year. Some years I've skipped. Other years I've had several rounds. I think the level of stress I put myself through plays a huge role in SS symptoms. I have found a job that isn't stress free but gives me a great work life balance and the stress is minimal. The gym helps to manage whatever stress I do experience.  And I got rid of an abusive boyfriend. So, that has helped a lot."
"i would suggest looking at the limits you mention in the last paragraph. unfortunately SS and other AI conditions mean your limits are much lower than others, and that you shouldnt push yourself to them. it sucks to be a young person with this kinda condition (source, diagnosed when 19, had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as a child though so know how it feels to be a patient all your life) as you want to act like others your age and not let it own you, but sometimes you do have to listen to your body more than your mind."
"if you can manage, i'd also suggest trying yoga. It helps center the mind which really helps with the brain fog, i also find its a good way to meditate to distract you from your symptoms. It's also gentle exercise which helps keep your joints in line so you can develop strength at your own rate and also make yourself feel better as you develop. Its low impact, there's lots of different styles to try that are not about handstanding and putting your legs behind your head, but more about finding your breath and alignment. The attitude with yoga is to listen to your body and do what you can, so if you need to take a rest during class you wont get yelled at or judged which is good too, everyone just goes at their own pace. & my absolute favourite part is that at the end of every yoga class, there's whats called a savasana - you get to lie down for 5 minutes :) its not a cure for the condition but its a practice that, since starting, i've really felt a massive relief from my symptoms, so i wonder if it might help others do the same."
I have all of the symptoms you mention. The memory is most frustrating since the pain is well managed most days. Know that your body is trying it's best.
I recommend finding a therapist to support your processing the change in your body and lifestyle.
Found this site and podcast beneficial on the rough days [link is to the therapist directory.](https://laurenselfridge.com/directory/)
Thanks for the reply!
"I actually do go to rheumatologists often, is just a lot of them don't have much knowledge when it comes to SS. I had a wonderful doctor when I was young and another wonderful some years ago, but they are now in another state and I can't afford to travel to see them, so I have to try doctors my insurance covers. Which has been a disaster, mostly."
"Seemed to help when I first when on it. Kind of hard to tell if it's still working since I've been on it a couple years now, but I think it is. The manufacturer also offers a coupon/discount for the first year but it's VERY expensive. I use the vials til they're empty, but technically you're supposed to use a drop per eye and toss. Because of this, a 3 month supply has lasted me probably 9 months. Before I've satisfied my deductible though, the 3 month supply cost around $1200."
"Restasis didn't work well enough for me. I was thinking about switching to Xildra, but that's even more expensive and tastes awful (drops drain down sinuses to mouth). I ended up getting all four puncta plugged and that has made a world of difference from me in terms of both comfort and no need for daily prescription eye drops."
"It took some time, but it works really well for me, although it does take a few months to really notice a difference."

"I saw someone else mention the price and yeah it’s not super cheap, but I combine my insurance with a manufacturer coupon to significantly lower the copay so it turns out be pretty affordable for me."
I’ve been able to renew my manufacturer discount by using a different email for multiple years so it’s only 30 dollars for 3 months supply! It has definitely helped me!
"Damn, that is expensive!"
"It really is. I've been able to continue using it because I'm still on my mom's insurance plan and we have a joint deductible, so I've been able to wait until she satisfies the deductible to refill it because last year she had cataract surgery and this year she has a hip injury. It's still around $240 after I've met my deductible though."
I've been on Cevimeline (generic Evoxac) for about three years. I take it with a cup of water (about 15-17 sips) and within half an hour experience increased saliva flow for about 4 hours. I take it before bed and then two more times during the day / evening. The only side effect I've had was nausea once when I didn't drink enough water. Salagen (generic is called Pilocarpine) is also available but I haven't tried it because I tried Cevimeline first and it worked well. Some people report a side effect of increased sweating on one or both of the drugs but that hasn't happened to me.
"The meds didn't work in my case, but my saliva flow and spit volume test results were ZERO. What does help my mouth is frequent salivary gland massage. Most people do it from the outside, but I go right into my mouth and slide my finger along the parotid glands. Sometimes, I get so much that I'm drooling. Another benefit to this is that it expresses some gunk from the glands. Not stones, but soft matter. After that, my saliva flow is somewhat improved for a few days. I ran it by my rheumatologist and she approved this measure."

"Best of luck, OP. Desert mouth is the worst!"
"My rheumatologist prescribed eyedrops to use in my mouth to increase saliva production: Isopto carpine 4%, 1 or 2 drops, 2 or 3 times per day. He also set me up with CBD cannabis oil (1:20), through CanniMed, for joint pain. He suggested that since I take it before bed, it may also help lubricate my mouth. I didn't notice any improvement from taking the CBD oil, but the eyedrops in my mouth does stimulate saliva. No side effects noticed. Good luck!"
Salagen is amazing. :)
"My rheumatologist has been hesitant to put me on meds because my dry mouth isn't too bad yet.  But she does have me using [Biotene ](https://www.amazon.com/Biotene-Fresh-Moisturizing-Mouthwash-Alcohol-Free/dp/B002KAOAZ4)before bed every night and once I wake up every morning.  I've also added a humidifier to my room and moved my normal bedroom fan a little further way so that the air is still moving near me, but its not blowing in my face."

"Your case seems a lot more advanced than mine, so definitely talk to your rheumatologist."
I second Cevimeline.  I have been on it a year and it makes ALL the difference.  I take it three times a day as well and each dose lasts 6-7 hours.  When it wears off in the night my dry mouth will actually wake me up as it is bone dry.

I can even eat food without having to drink as long as the med is in my system.  I don't think I have had any adverse problems from it at all.
OK thanks.
White patches sound like lichen planus. Any dentist can diagnose it by appearance. Rule that out first! It can cause dry mouth as well.
"I have had horrible white patches on my tongue since I got sick many years ago, even before that actually. To my knowledge it doesn’t have much to do with the dry mouth thing, it’s more related to your gut and that’s something’s wrong there. Imbalance etc. Whenever I have worse days I also have more stomach pains plus the patches in my tongue. I don’t think those patches itself or a dry mouth itself means someone has sjögren’s, but with other symptoms it could mean that though."

"I got my diagnose after struggling to get it for YEARS, finally after they took a biopsy from my lip."
"I was diagnosed based on symptoms and blood test - positive SSA or SSB (antibodies), I don't remember which.  Nortriptaline has dry mouth, throat and lips as possible side effects. Have your tried discontinuing it to see if symptoms improve? Are you on any other meds?"
"I was diagnosed twelve years ago by lip biopsy. An Ear, Nose, and Throat Dr. did the biopsy. He showed me my results in the office, but the lab still called and confirmed."
"I had two bouts of parotitis last summer; first my right parotid gland, and about two weeks later, the left. After ruling out other common causes of parotitis, my ENT had my rheumatoid factor and SSA/SSB levels checked. They were all indicative of Sjögren’s and I was referred to a rheumatologist who confirmed."

No white patches for me.
Try doing a sleep study.
"Lip biopsy. All my blood tests, MRI's, Inflammation markers were mostly normal."
I have seen a dentist and ENT and neither were able to diagnose it.
Thanks for the reply! I will keep that in mind. I'm really curious what the specialist will say about the patches.
"I had the dry mouth well before I started the nortriptyline. I've only been on nortriptyline for a few weeks and I'm not sure if it's doing anything at this point tbh. I haven't noticed any changes, except maybe the dry mouth is a little worse. No other meds."
Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for sharing!
I’ve had Sjogren’s for over 25 years.  Recurrent eye infections lead me to my diagnosis.  Severe dry eye started shortly after a really bad strep infection.  I had to stop wearing contacts not long after.  For 10 years doc rationalized symptoms as something else.  I stumbled on it by accident when I read about it in a pamphlet about dry eyes in the ophthalmologist office with yet another infection.  Referred me to rheumatologist and a month latter I was diagnosed.   This was pre-internet so it was harder back then.

"Any anticholinergic meds will exacerbate dry mouth symptoms.  For me, nortriptyline it made my dry eyes and dry mouth much, much worse and I had to stop.  Doc was trying it to see if it’d help my neuropathy.  I didn’t take it long enough to find out. As for the white patches, I get them too.  In my case it’s part of a condition called “geographic tongue”.   Sometimes it can be like the taste buds are falling off my tongue.  Some SS patients get it and other exciting oral symptoms.  I’ll get ulcers in the back of my throat the size of a quarter and they’ll biopsy and it’ll come back as “non-herpetic, inflammatory process of unknown origin”.   I like the “non-herpetic”part. That’s a good thing.  Hurts so bad I have to swirl oral lidocaine to numb throat so I can eat.  Thankfully it doesn’t happen too often.  Parotid gland swelling is a fun one too.   Oral hygiene is paramount if you are diagnosed with SS."
"Forgot to answer the whole question.  Diagnosis was based on positive SS-A and SS-B, positive Schirmer’s test (1mm in both eyes), and parotid swelling.   Initially tested positive for lupus, but more definitive tests ruled that out later.  The criteria was different back then and doc sees no point in putting me through a lip biopsy now."
"If the nortriptyline isn't making a noticeable difference other than dry mouth, I suggest you try something else so you can prevent damage to your teeth. In the meantime, you can use dry mouth lozenges, mouth spray and mouthwash (available in drug store dental product aisles), sugarless gum, and swish water. If your doctor is willing to treat symptoms, you can request evoxac or salagen, prescription meds that help with saliva production. Plaquenil may help alleviate or eliminate joint pain and fatigue."

"To answer your other question, I haven't had white patches on tongue."
"Yes, I use some of these products and drink a lot more water than I did before the dry mouth presented. I have been on a low dose nortriptyline for less than a month - I'm not an expert but I don't think it is uncommon to not have much noticeable difference at this point. I have a very good dentist that is aware of what's going on and will be seeing another dental specialist in a few weeks, so I think my oral health will be in good hands. Thank you for the suggestions."
"Oh yeah, speaking of dentists . . . I get fluoride treatment after every cleaning. Hopefully that is helping, too."
"Chronic illnesses can be very hard on a patient's emotional well-being, and this in turn often causes strain on relationships. As someone with SS, it can be frustrating when people try to empathize because I know that deep down, they don't really understand what I am going through. However, I understand that my loved ones care about me and want to help, so I look past this and do my best to accept their support. I also try to make a point when I'm really having a bad day to say that I may be grumpy, but it isn't that person's fault."

"It sounds like counseling would be useful for both of you. He should look into finding a individual counselor who specializes in chronic illnesses. Many integrative health centers can provide these services, and more insurance plans are covering them. A trained counselor can also help him try to manage his disease through diet, activity, and alternative therapies. This will also give him a semblance of control; often the lack of control contributes to depression and anxiety. Finally, if his depression is very serious, he can be referred to a doctor who can prescribe treatment. It sounds like his symptoms are particularly problematic, so a discussion with a rheumatologist about additional treatment options may also be helpful."

"You both could likely use some relationship counseling as well, preferably from a couples counselor who understands chronic illnesses. I would wait until he has had some individual counseling and then tackle this step."

"Finally, your partner should look into meetups and groups for patients with chronic illnesses. This will help him to feel less isolated. Other patients may also help him with coping strategies."

"Good luck! It sounds like you are trying to support your partner, which is commendable. I encourage you to keep helping him work through the stages of grief so he can accept the new normal and build a new positive lifestyle within its constraints. However, if he refuses to take steps to help himself and increases his verbal abuse, you may have to consider moving on."
"As someone that has Sjogren's, I would be interested to know how you'd like for your partner to communicate the severity of a Sjogren's flare up to you."

"While I am a good communicator in business and academia, when it comes to describing how I'm feeling around Sjogrens, I just can't seem to capture the magnitude of what I'm going through."

"I'm finding it difficult to describe the sudden onset of the 'crumple and fold' fatigue that puts a stop to the day's activities, even to my very loving and understanding partner."

"Can you guide me around how you wish your partner would communicate to you, or anything that you wish I knew from your standpoint as someone supporting a loved one with Sjogrens?"
I’ve been on plaquenil (200mg x2) for many years and never was told it would help with parotid problem.  Plaquenil is supposed to be used to ease the arthritis symptoms.  That was what I was told anyway.  Short courses of prednisone (7 or 10 day step) helped me with parotid swelling.  Though too much of that can leave you looking like a chipmunk.  Prednisone has it has its own set of fun side effects.  Soft frozen gel packs helped me.   Ice packs were just too much cold and too hard on painful glands.  Hang in there.
OK thanks.  My joints are fine however.
How’d it go?
"So the doctor was great, did a thorough evaluation and conversation.  He told me about how he normally sees visual signs of SS on someone's face and I didn't have any of that.  He evaluated me for any type of arthritis and everything was fine there, soreness was probably more soft tissue related.  I did bloodwork for RF, 2 types of SS antibodies, all came back normal."

"Since that appointment I was diagnosed with mild obstructive sleep apnea so I'm hoping that is my main cause for the symptoms.  I know dry mouth can definitely be a symptom of OSA, not sure how the eyes factor in."
"I hadn't heard of Dr. Coimbra's vitamin D protocol before seeing your post but after reviewing website I see that I have already been doing it for the most part for at least a year now. Among other vitamins and supplements, I take D3 (not as much as Coimbra recommend though), magnesium glycinate and a B combo. I have been meaning to add K2 for a while but having gotten around to looking into types and brands. Whole foods rather than supplements are definitely good if you can get enough of everything in your diet daily - sometimes hard to do."
"From a pain level 1-10 I feel like 8 constantly. I have a weird manifestation in which Sjogrens is attacking my fat pads that are in my neck causing it to swell really bad to the point I can look behind me to back out my car at times, and also making it very painful. I’ve tried nearly everything prescription wise with no help. I also have muscle/joint pain as well."

"I have noticed some help (barely a smidge) with high dose turmeric that’s a liquid, and dhea fish oil x2. That I take twice daily."

"That is very true. My Dr told me to omit dairy, beans ,nuts, and anything fortified with calcium from my diet. So I’m trying to find a good milk substitute. From what I understand this protocol has a 100% success rate. He is also getting all those vitamins compounded into one pill and then the d will be separate."
"The NatureWise curcumin appears to get really good reviews from people with autoimmune problems. I switched to it from another and thought it was better than what I was originally using. Might be worth it to change for a trial run and see if you feel a difference. Also, magnesium glycinate is a good natural muscle relaxer, so you might get some relief from that. Dr.'s Best and Kal are good brands. I take one in the morning and one before bed. Also helps with sleep quality. Good luck with whatever you do. Sjogren's is very annoying. :-/"
"100% success rate for what and how is it measured? I don't take D3, magnesium or vitamin B specifically for any Sjogren's symptoms and don't find they help with any dryness symptoms. Here's info on vitamin D and Sjogren's. http://info.sjogrens.org/conquering-sjogrens/ask-the-doctor-sjogrens-and-the-benefits-of-vitamin-d"

"What is your doctor's rationale for omitting dairy, beans, nuts and anything fortified with calcium?"

ETA: Here's a link to more discussions about the protocol in a Sjogren's forum in case you're interested. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?action=search2
"It’s been proven to make autoimmune disease go into remission. They have you omit nuts,dairy because high dose D (I’ll be starting out at 70,000iu daily) can cause calcification of your organs. My Dr actually went to meet Dr. Coimbra in Brazil to learn about it. He said the results people had were amazing. I’m just to the point literally nothing I have tried helps...not even CBD for pain. So I’m willing to give it a go. If you want I will update this thread after I’ve started the protocol."
Interesting. Thanks for the additional information. I hope the protocol works for you.

What kind of pain are you having? NatureWise brand curcumin helps eliminate or alleviate my joint pain.
Do you have someone who can go with you and act as an advocate? It can be your husband or a really close friend... Anyone you trust completely to help assert your concerns and back you up regarding what you're feeling.

"It took me 20 years to get diagnosed and even then it was a bit of a fluke. Rheumatologists are usually the doctors one sees about Sjogren's so maybe talk with your primary doc about a referral. If your doctor still isn't keen on doing any of the tests for Sjogren's or referring you to a rheumatologist, you're probably going to need to find another doctor or learn how to assert yourself in order to get them to listen. One thing you can do is flat out ask why they think you might not have the disorder since you have many of the classic symptoms of it. Listen to what they have to say and if they try to say it's your anxiety again tell them that you will be looking for another doctor who is more interested in taking your concerns seriously."
I think all us were treated crazy trying to get a diagnosis. Took me more than 20 years.  An MS friend suggested choosing an internal medical doctor as my primary care provider. Great choose. He was able to get me to any specialist I need and keep the process moving
"I’ve been on it for 14 years (lupus and sjogrens) and have had little to no side effects. You have to get your eyes examined every year (by an ophthalmologist, not an eye optometrist) only real thing I’ve had to “deal with”. I believe it’s the reason I haven’t had a really bad flare up since my original diagnosis."

"Sure I have bouts of fatigue, stiffness in my hands, some GI problems (likely just stress related), and some minor trouble sleeping. Nothing I can’t manage. Major rashes have been kept at bay."
"The only side effect I had when I was on it was nausea which was remedied by only taking half a regular dose. However, it didn't seem to do much for me so I switched to something else."

"All meds will have the potential for side effects: some mild and some very serious. That doesn't mean that you will experience any of them and even if you do, not all side effects are worth stopping a medication. Unfortunately some side effects can be quite serious so always ask your doctor about side effects and what to watch out for."
"The only side effect I have gotten is upset stomach with diarrhea if I dont have it with a big meal. I was diagnose July 28 and I didnt start plaquenil Aug 20th. so I'm a new user. But I haven't noticed anything else. It's really helped me with my dry throat and dry eyes. I still have muscle pains, and I have the occasional fatigue. Advil liquid gels help a lot with the muscle pains. (600mg)  But good luck, but don't be afraid, I would hate to know what other pain i would be in without it."
"No real side effects in the 20+ years I’ve been on it.  It’s not a medicine like a pain reliever or anti-inflammatory that you’ll know pretty much right away if it helps, which sucks.  I was told it could take 6 months for some people to see improvement.  The reason I started taking it for in the first place is the least of my problems now.  I do get the expensive field vision test done every year.  Sorry I couldn’t give you a better answer."
"I was on it but it made me very depressed as in being scared for my safety, so I took myself off it and those feelings went away. It did help with the fatigue and the pain but it wasn't enough for me to stay on it. I'm waiting to see me doctor about other options"
"I have tried it twice, had to go off of it both times.  Made me very paranoid, forgetful, and emotional.  Not worth the other, very good benefits."
Same! I’d hate to think about going off it. Worth the try for anyone newly diagnosed
An ultrasonic humidifier helps me.

"Edit: also make sure you get the preservative-free eye drops, and get checked for allergies."
"I have the best luck with a gel, but it can make vision a bit blurry for a few seconds. I also find that FreshKote helps quite a bit, but there's a bit of preservative that irritates my eyes so I use another eye drop first, wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the FreshKote."

There are also meds that can help.
"Good call, thank you! Not sure if I was going to need to get prescription drops or something. I’ve been good for 10+ years but all of a sudden my eyes hate me!"
"I was just diagnosed in August 2017, although I have probably been developing this disease for several years. The rheumatologist started me on plaq and I haven't yet noticed any difference. My symptoms are constant. I had to start on modafanil just to make it through the day, my fatigue is severe. Also eye drops and mouth rinses, which offer minimal relief."
"Started on evoxac and plaquenil. Now on prednisone as needed and Imuran twice daily. So far no side effects, but I am not seeing much of a change. Go back for more bloodwork to check antibody levels in Nov."
I started on evoxac for dry mouth but when I switched insurance they made me try Salogen (pilocarpine) which made me a lot sweatier and less comfortable and just didn't keep my mouth moist for more than a couple of hours. I was able to go back on Evoxac but realized after a few months that it was responsible for worsening (and worsening!) diarrhea. Going off it fixed diarrhea the next day.

"Currently, I'm going back to low-dose naltrexone, which I use for multiple autoimmune issues; I hope it helps my fibromyalgia, which is currently absolutely kicking my ass. Doc told me to start on turmeric, which I've been lax on. Also, fish oil capsules, 2-3 a day I need to get back on."

"I don't have a Sjogren's dx, all my antibodies are too low. Interestingly, I also lack ANA and RF antibodies which I've had all my life until the past year and a half. Could be due to my low-inflammatory foods diet (paleo-ish). I try to eat lots of fresh food, though sometimes it's such a pain in the ass that I end up making a smoothie/protein shake."

"I have squirt-Biotene at my bedside and drops. I try to drink lots and lots of liquids, which does help and has even helped my singing voice (I am in an original rock band) when Evoxac only helped a little. I take aspirin or Excendrin, or ibuprofen when I'm super-achy and the occasional lidocaine Salon Pas patch when I strain something, which is often, even without exercising or moving around much, as in the past few weeks."
"A biopsy isn't always required, no. I got mine based on blood work and the eye strip test and lots of other things but no biopsy. Explain your concern to your rheumatologist. Most importantly, don't panic! Sjogren's sucks, but you CAN have an awesome life in spite of it. :)"
"I got mine diagnosed after 12 years. Lol I'm 33 they didn't believe me half the time but I learned to go back Everytime something was wrong. Finally I got vitamin d 50,000  for life and told I didn't have lupus multiple times.... Anyways... Long story short, I had a new doctor who finally did the proper blood work and they called me and told me on the phone what I had. I was relieved and pissed it took that long. I didn't have to do the biopsy and hot on meds and changed my habits and diet. The diet is hard and I still struggle. I wish you luck. It does get better once you know and can treat it. :)!"
"My rheumatologist actually didn't want to have the biopsy done because she didn't think it was necessary in my case. However, I did have all the eye tests done and as those were pretty conclusive, she said she didn't need the biopsy done."
"With elevated SS-A and/or SS-B levels, dry eyes, and dry mouth, you have met the required criteria based on the [American-European Consensus Criteria for Sjögren’s Syndrome](https://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/disease-information/diagnosis-sjogrens-syndrome/americaneuropean-consensus-criteria-sjgrens-syndrome/)."

"At this point, a biopsy is completely unnecessary. Due to the potential risks of nerve damage, I would strongly advise against it. If your doctor pushes for it, find a new doctor."

"On another note, I'm sorry that you have SS, but treatments should hopefully help you to improve your quality of life."
"Thank you all for the replies! My rheumatologist appointment is still a month out, but now I feel a lot better about it. I've been doing a lot of research and it does seem to suck, but it also seems better than some of the other things I could have had. I'm grateful that's it's a manageable disease. Now I just hope I get told that I only have Sjorgens and not something else (like Lupus) as well."

"As for the biopsy; I have an anxiety thing about people even touching my neck, so the idea of a needle being used for a biopsy is terrifying to me. But it seems like in my case it won't be necessary and I can focus instead on treatment for symptoms. Thanks for putting my mind at ease and the kind thoughts. :)"
"In case you do need a biopsy: it's not all that bad. It was a lot like going to the dentist and took just a few minutes. Lots of drooling afterwards, though.  Pm me if you need any details :)"
"If you tested positive for the antibodies, you shouldn't need a biopsy. A positive antibody test is enough to diagnose any autoimmune disorder."
I didn’t have to have a biopsy
What kind of diet are you doing? Newly diagnosed...I've already been doing a low gluten diet.
"I honestly have been horrible about it lately. But water, so much water. I cant express enough how much it helps. Cut sugars and stimulants like coffee and soda. Sleep and rest will be you best friend. I like a lot of soup as it is easier to swallow and moisturizes my sinuses. Citrus hurts my stomach so I limit grapefruit juice and no orange use at all. Pineapple however helps with inflammation and somehow can handle it. I hope any of this helps. Also you may have different triggers than I do. Good luck and welcome to the club. It's doable :)"
No coffee??? I can barely make it out of bed as it is...I've cut back on sugars which may have helped. Idk. It would be nice to have some energy again! How long have you been diagnosed?
"Hey I don't judge on the coffee. Soda is my vice. Do you take a vitamin D supplement? That helped me so much especially in the sore and tired moments. I take 50,000 mg of it once a week. The doctor prescribed it. It's only been about 3 years. I'm still learning. It took almost 12 to get a real diagnosis. I felt like they thought I was making things up. I quit going to the doctor for a while because of it. I just dealt with it until I couldn't ignore it. I got a new doctor and she did the blood work and sure enough it came out as such. I cried, I was scared and relieved to know I really had something going on and now I could figure out what I needed to do next!"
How long have you had symptoms? How did they find out?
Oh and don't forget how important protein is!! :)
"My husband and I just went off coffee. It IS hard, but having some tea helps with the weaning; it will at least stop the caffeine-withdrawal headache. Or you could just keep cutting down until you get to 0."

"Sjogrens wasn't even the reason we went off coffee. My husband read an article about how caffeine prevents deep sleep which helps the draining off your brain of Alzheimer plaques. Given 3 of our parents died of dementia, we are all about growing old with our brains intact."
"Thank you so much for responding...I do take vitamin D but maybe I will increase the amount...50,000mg!!! I take a variety of other vitamins and supplements as well. I am going to DM you:)"

"My eye doctor prescribed Restasis. I've only been on it a couple weeks, but from what I've noticed so far it seems to help. Good luck, I hope you find something that works!"
"I wear prescription Costa Del Mar sunglasses with snap-in side shields for long distance cycling, fishing, and just being out on windy days.  They don't fog up too bad.  I carry preservative free drops with me everywhere I go.  I've had punctual plugs and they help a little I guess, though one came out years ago and I didn't know until at my annual plaquenil exam when Dr. told me.  I didn't have it put back in due to cost.  You can have the ducts cauterized, but that's a bit extreme to me.  I use ointment at night before bed or else I can't open my eyes in the morning without significant pain.  I always keep drops on my nightstand for that."
Restasis and/or Xildra prescription eye drops. Saliva production meds Salagen or Evoxac (or their generics) can also help some people with tear production. Punctal plugs.
In addition to eye drops she can use eye gel. It's thicker and stays in the eye longer. Punctum plugs and generic Restasis have also been amazing for me.
Ketotifen fumarate eye drops were a huge game changer for me. If she hasn't tried it yet it's worth a shot.
Thanks all for their input!

"After trying out your suggestions, she has seen lots of improvement. She's not on Reddit but here's her response."

"""I started using thicker gel drop celluvisc at night and allowing my eyes to stay coated for the whole night and trying to not open my eyes after putting it in and then going to bed immediately. Made a huge difference, maintenance by systane preservative free drops"

"Still looking for recommendations for sport goggles with prescription.  Thanks to Reddit for help!"""
"I'm so sorry for your situation. I don't have POF or lupus, but I do have a whole host of health issues myself. I can relate to just how devastating it can be when hit with one diagnosis after another after another especially when they start talking about high risks for other serious diseases. It's important to remember that being at risk for something is not a guarantee that you will develop it. It just means you might need to be evaluated more thoroughly or more often. Or that maybe you need to make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk (if the disease is one that can be affected by lifestyle changes)."

"Perhaps you would benefit from a support group regarding the POF. If you can't find one locally, there might be one online. When you feel less overwhelmed, maybe go back to the doctor to find out what your options would be regarding POF, perhaps even find a specialist."
Thank you for your kind words. It was suggested I have a team of doctors so that's what I'll do. Thanks again :)
"It's been my experience that health insurance rarely covers anything dental, but that doesn't mean yours won't. My current insurance won't cover anything dental related unless it's related to renal transplant, heart valve transplant, or the treatment of neoplastic disease and in two of those cases it's just a comprehensive exam that's covered."





"The dental bills really are super depressing! I tried for about $3k after insurance and they said no, but I have heard that in extreme cases (like upward of 5 figures) they can sometimes use different billing codes. It's definitely bullshit that we pay so much oop for a systemic illness, though."
"We fought for YEARS with our health insurance companies to get my dental bills covered (over 25k in total) with no luck, and my mom is quite aggressive! It is so frustrating to me that dental barely pays out, and health insurance companies refuse to cover, when the issues are literally caused by a health issue."
Thank you so much. Have you had any success in getting anything related covered under your insurance in terms of symptoms? We are going to try every avenue available to try to ease the financial burden. I know it may be a long shot but it never hurts to ask or try. Thanks again for responding!
"In my case, insurance hasn't covered anything in regards to dental, but has covered some things in regards to vision. Recently my rheumatologist wanted me on a med that my prescription insurance didn't cover and she managed to get them to cover it so it never hurts to ask."

"Since insurance doesn't cover the dental aspect, I just do everything my dentist says to do in order to prevent dental problems as much as possible. I also have TMJ and periodontal disease, but I haven't needed anything other than cleanings for the last 10+ years so whatever I'm doing seems to be working. I really hope you two will be able to ease the burden a bit. If nothing else, you can always try GoFundMe to help with costs."
"Well, this is a huge coincidence, I am getting fitted for scleral contacts day after tomorrow. I've been researching corrective surgery for the past few months, and it came down sclerals versus IOL (clear lens replacement). I decided I'm not quite ready to have my lenses replaced just yet and the cost is much higher for CLR."

"I've worn rigid gas permeable's since junior high, but lately they've been getting really dry by evening."

Somebody in /R/optometry turned me on to scleral's and I found a good optometrist who could tell me all about them and has lots of experience fitting them.

"Glad to hear yours are working out. Hopefully, I'll be able to say the same!"
"Yes, good luck!! Some day I'll need lens replacement as well, as I have congenital subluxated lenses, but hopefully that won't be for a while."

"The fact that you've worn RGP lenses before will make the transition easier, but there's still a learning curve to putting them in with the huge bubble of saline in them with your face parallel to the table. After you get the hang of it you feel like a wizard haha"
"Has your girlfriend seen a rheumatologist? The doctor can prescribe plaquenil which can help alleviate or eliminate joint pain and fatigue, and other medications for saliva production (salagen, evoxac or their generic forms). The Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation website has a lot of helpful information https://www.sjogrens.org/ as does Sjogren's World which also has message boards http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php"
Thank you I just didnt know what kind of help she would need. She grew up in a family that didn't go to the doctor often so they just kind of left it how it was. But she finally has her own insurance and she is completely independant so she can get good help now.
"She is very lucky to have such a supportive and caring boyfriend like you! You're doing the right thing reaching out and asking for help. I know when I'm not feeling well and having a flare, I need my husband there to be my advocate. You mentioned by the end of the day she has a hard time even walking, and that makes me worried. Not to worry either one of you, but there could be more then just Sjogrens that is causing her the fatigue she is having. Often, autoimmune disease come in clusters and people can have more then one rheumatoid disease. If she has insurance, call the number on the back of the insurance card and ask them if she will need a referral to see a rheumatologist. If she does, her primary doctor can refer to one. Once she sees the rheumatologist, they will do an exam and see if there is anything else that may be going on. I hope that helps you."
"It can take a while to get an appointment with a rheumatologist, especially as a new patient, as there is often a backlog. While she's waiting for an appointment, here is a list of over the counter remedies she might want to try depending on what kind of symptoms she has. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?topic=10139.0"
"The first couple times I had botox I was foggy brained, dry eyed,  could sleep all day fatigue,  and just felt so off. The last three times I've been way better after injections. I can't say that it was the botox because I was still battling getting a lot of inflammation under control, but I almost didn't  continue because I felt so bad after. My rheumy said she really didn't think it would cause it, but.... I was heavily suspicious. All I can say is if you want to try it for a few more times to see if it continues,  consider it. Third time was the charm for me lol"
That's good to hear it wears off. I'm not really concerned with getting botox agains as much as when these side effects will wear off. How long did your side effects last? I'm really hoping mine won't take 3 months especially since I only had 2 units but the dry mouth is killer. I've been chugging water and taking lozenges and salagen and evoxac but I'm not getting any relief so I hope it won't take too long.
"I have no experience with botox, but I find chewing gum and glycerin mouth gel to be very helpful for dry mouth. Best of luck!"
See an ENT and have them swab and run a culture to see if you actually have a sinus infection.
"I have these same symptoms and was diagnosed with Sjogrens two years ago. I recently went to see an ENT for, what felt like, a chronic sinus infection. My CT scan showed that I have a deviated septum, but I did not have a sinus infection at the time. I was told surgery would open up the airways to help prevent future sinus infections; however, my other symptoms, runny nose, hoarseness, dry eyes, were most likely all related to Sjogrens. So, I too am continuing to look for some resolutions to these symptoms."
"It can be, but just because you might have an autoimmune disorder doesn't mean you won't get other things like colds and sinus infections on top of the autoimmune disorder. Go to your doctor to rule out an infection and to get suggestions for dealing with the dryness and irritation. There are a lot of things you can do that are inexpensive to try to relieve some of your symptoms if it's from Sjogren's. If those don't work, there are medications too."

I have them all over my house. They are super helpful especially when sleeping. I am an open mouth sleeper and I can't tell you how many times I'd wake up in a coughing dry throat fit  always worth a try!
"I've tried many of the small drugstore brands (Walgreen's) both warm and cool.  I prefer the warm ones myself for my sinuses and eyes. All have proven difficult to keep clean and bacteria free though.  One that will run most of the night is my fav.  Close the bedroom door and let it run for a couple of hours before bed, then top off water before calling it a night.  It's hard to embrace as a guy, but putting lotion on right after a shower helps me with dry itchy skin.  Hot showers feel SO good on my muscles, but they strip away natural oils from skin.  My legs itch the worst this time of year.  A whole house humidifier would be best I think."
"I use a 2 gallon humidifier from Costco in my bedroom. I find it to be somewhat helpful, particularly in the winter. It's a pretty inexpensive investment to try. Mine has a warming setting, but uses considerably more electricity so I usually keep it off."

"Just note that you will either need to replace filters, or dust mineral deposits from your furniture (depending on how hard your water is)."

"I bought an expensive bon air one last year and it just doesn't make a huge difference.   The reading never changes.   Not sure if it's the high ceilings or large bedroom,  but I wish I had one built in."
"I have been using one for almost a year now.  Unfortunately, it's effects aren't very noticeable—especially this time of year. I still use it daily just in case it helps a tiny bit, but I still wake up with dry mouth and painful, dry eyes."
"I'd have to say that if you saw that you were worse when you went of of Plaquenil, you might as well go back on it. I don't know if you had any side effects, but the effects you're having now sound pretty lousy!"

"You might ask whether your Sjogren's is primary or secondary. I also have fibromyalgia with Sjogren's , so it helps to know whether you have another immune disease along with it."
"The problem with DMARDs is that they take many weeks to build up, and so you don't necessarily notice the benefit they're providing and suddenly stopping it can really set you off into a flare. I'd recommend you go back on it ASAP so you can start rebuilding it in your body."

"You can have seronegative RA. If the plaquenil was working for you, that's an indication you're probably in the immune space. Did you ever do a two week steroid taper?"
"Joints can definitely be affected by Sjogren's and the disease can be severe. You can also have something else. I have primary Sjogren's and fibromyalgia that started decades ago and then about 6 years ago I developed psoriatic arthritis and that was discovered because I started having severe stiffness and joint pain that I hadn't had before. The arthritis isn't a definite diagnosis right now though. More of a ""most likely"" scenario although the meds I take for it actually help a lot."

"Plaquenil didn't help me at all and I barely tolerated it anyway. However, it seems like it might have been helping you. It might help to start tracking your pain and stiffness: severity, what makes it better/worse, problems you are having (lack of sleep, problems doing tasks). There are apps you can use or just paper and pen."

"There is no one single test that will definitely say you have Sjogren's. You might have been misdiagnosed or you might just be developing something new. In my case, I have two definite diagnoses (Sjogren's and fibromyalgia) and two very likely but not quite sure (doc's words, not mine) of psoriatic arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. All of these have the same symptoms with a few variations. If your Sjogren's was diagnosed by multiple docs I suspect you probably do have it. But you should definitely bring up that you might think you don't have Sjogren's at your appointment. Ask the doctor to explain exactly why they think you have it and ask them how confident they are that the diagnosis is accurate. I have found out a lot of information that way. Also, have you had any of the eye tests or saliva tests in addition to your blood work? If not, you might want to talk with your doctor about those too."

"I'm a 50-ish male diagnosed about 25 years ago and I've been on Plaquenil for the the better part of 15 years.  Joint pain was one of my biggest complaints when I was your age before my diagnosis, which took over 10 years.  Joint pain in SS patients is generally milder than true RA patients.  My sed rate and other tests for RA were normal, but I'm off the charts for SS-A and SS-B.  It's different for everyone it seems. For me plaquenil seems to have worked.  I had a lot of cortisone shots before plaquenil and I didn't tolerate long term prednisone very well. If you do go on plaquenil you need to make sure you get a field vision test every year due to a very slight risk of retina damage possible.  Plaquenil takes months to start working so you have to be patient and give it a chance if you do go down that road.  Regular exercise may seem counter-intuitive right now, but it helped me a lot.  That takes awhile to work too.  Good luck."
"Ahh, I didn't have any side effects with Plaquenil. I thought side effects were minimal with that medication :(? I was diagnosed with Hashi's at 10, but wasn't diagnosed with Sjogrens until about 4 years ago. I'm in my early 20s."
> another immune disease along with it.

"You don't mean to imply that fibromyalgia is an immune disease, do you? Because it's not."
I was on Plaquenil for 2 years before I went off and I did taper it. I'm going to look into the situation.
"Yeah, they never did saliva tests or a biopsy on me. So I was never 100% set on my diagnosis. Now that I have a better understanding of Sjogrens, I think I am more confident in bringing it up at my next appointment. Thanks for the info."
Thank you :). I am actually going to try Plaquenil again. I saw my Rheumatologist a few hours ago. She's going to order some tests to see if I have any other antibody activity going on.
"Prednisone, not Plaquenil! Yeah, I'm been taking Plaquenil for awhile now, no problems."
"Good point, I wasn't thinking."
"I meant did you try a two week steroid taper. Plaquenil is not a steroid. Youd have done something like take 40mg of prednisone for four days then 30 mg for four days, then 20mg then 10mg. It's a common clinical diagnostic tool."
"I didn't have the saliva tests or biopsy done because my rheumatologist didn't think it was necessary and she felt that biopsy would have been unnecessary. She felt it was pretty obvious that I don't produce a lot of saliva. I ended up getting the eye tests done because I mentioned the blood test results to my eye doctor during my usual exam who insisted on doing them immediately. There is definitely no doubt in my case that I have it. My blood work wasn't ambiguous either, but it is quite common for questionable blood work regarding Sjogren's. It did take me about 17 years to be diagnosed though."
"I've been taking Plaquenil since 1989 (when I was dx'd with Lupus), but I've also been taking a variety of different anti-inflammatory drugs with it the entire time....Feldene, Vioxx, Etodolac, etc. My rheumy changes those as more side effects become known or for better efficacy. Perhaps you should discuss taking an NSAID with your rheumy to help with your joint pain."
"Haha okay, gotcha. They did try me on Prednisone but I had to be hospitalized because I turned out to be allergic."
"Haha no worries :) I just see a lot of people get diagnosed with fibro and then put on a steroid taper and end up with a positive response, and they never look further for what must be a co-morbid immune disease, since fibro wouldn't respond to steroids. So I like to point it out."
"I'm allergic to Prednisone actually, so I can't take steroids of that nature."
I did a prednisone taper -- It didn't help me at all. When I went back to the rheumatologist he was surprised to hear the steroids didn't help me and now he has put me on plaquenil. Is it possible to have an autoimmune thing that won't respond to steroids but will to plaquenil? I am having trouble understanding how my supposed autoimmune thing wasn't helped by prednisone but may be helped by plaquenil.
17 years?! That's insane..
Fun times!
"I did the whole prednisone thing (awhile ago), and found only minor improvements. Had to quit it since it's not the best to stay on long term, plus it had side effects. Still can't find anything that works for me, either condition!"
It's possible. I don't know how likely it is. You may also ask about something called Medtrol. I've responded to those dose packs far better than prednisone. Took until about day 3 before I realized it was working. You might have been far enough into a flare that the steroid couldn't really touch your symptoms. But the Plaquenil working is definitely a point in favor. I'd say go back on that and try another taper in the meantime.
"Sjogren's wasn't as well known then as it is now (not that it's really that well known now, but it's better)."
"Oh god prednisone is awful. I heard it called Satan's Tic Tac's earlier. So true. Did you ever try Restasis? That works for me. I also use tizanidine for muscle pain, a drug that's making a comeback called Orphenadrine, and a medicine for fatigue called amantadine. It's a flu drug that isn't well known, but it helps combat the feelings of being worn down, sore and aching. I like it! I also swear by my voltaren(diclofenac) gel and lidocaine cream. I like my neutrogena intensive moisture wrap for dry skin."
"Never heard of Restasis, tizanidine  or Orphenadrine. I do take dioclofenac, though. I used to take Lyrica, but my god, the side effects & eventual withdrawals sucked. I take gabapentin now, and while it's not as strong, it doesn't have anywhere near the downsides. I also took lidocaine patches, and they helped to a minor extent, but not enough to keep doing."

"I do love taking hot baths with scented epsom salts (Dr. Teels, although the scented ones are a bit expensive). Bengay type pain creams work ok too."
"Blistek, the stuff in the little white and blue pots. It's the only one that works for me. I can wear makeup lip gloss over that but I need that to make my lips not be chapped. I find I have to drink a lot of water to make them not be too. It's a constant battle against dehydration."
Coconut oil helps me tons. I wouldn't use a sugar scrub unless you make it yourself   a little sugar and some coconut oil and lightly go in circles for a minute. After lather coconut oil it will help. Coconut oil is the only thing that actually keep feeling moisturized all over. Good luck!


Vaseline makes an aloe Vera Lib rub in a little tin. Nothing has ever worked for me as well as that.
"I am a huge fan of the Bath and Body works ""my favorite night balm"" for overnight use.  Burt's Bees Chapstick seems to work best for me for during the day."
"The air at my job is *really* dry and I've been getting even worse chapped lips than usual, so I've been on this mission as well haha. So far, I've found that the best thing has been to rotate between a few different chapsticks that work well for me because for some reason, after a few days in a row, it's almost like they start irritating my lips all of a sudden or at least not working anymore. I'm making a point to avoid very pepperminty chapsticks in the day because they seem to either dry out my lips more, or at least the stingy mint feeling makes them *feel* irritated, so I lick them more and *that* dries them out. I always put a layer of Vaseline (cherry flavored in the lipglossy tube, not the jar) on top because of that and so I won't absentmindedly lick them even when I have the Chapstick on. I've been shuffling between the pomegranate Burt's Bees Chapstick, a Baby Lips Chapstick, and a fruity Eos one with the gloss on top when I need it and on the nights I get home and feel like I have desert lips, I'll sleep with some Chapstick on with some of the therapeutic Blistex lip ointment that's meant for skiers or some shit (that one's kinda Menthol-y). So far, so good!"
"For me anything with shea butter helps, though the best one I was able to find was blistex brand, no store in my area currently carries it anymore so I am on the search once again."
"I always grab for my Burt's Bees because it's handy, but I think my Vaseline lip balm works best. I did just order a highly rated beeswax lip balm off Amazon and I'm eager to try it out."
"The best balm for me is one that moisturises. I love Lush cosmetics. A bit pricey (at least here in Ireland) but their pots of lip balm go a *long* way. They come in all sorts of delicious flavours (honey & white chocolate, chocolate orange, lime, and more) and I find their staying power brilliant."

"Do you guys have a cosmetics range called Moo Goo? Cuz if you do their strawberry balm is delightful. I like Blistex lip conditioner too, makes your lips tingly and stays on for ages. Burts Bees are pretty good, I don't find their staying power great, but it's handy having a wind-up chapstick so you don't have to stop to dip into a pot, say mid-work (I serve the public, so I'm constantly talking, so I constantly need to replenish my lips). Nivea do a good macadamia flavoured one that tastes delightful, that has pretty good staying power."

"I gently exfoliate my lips about once a week with fine sugar, cuz I find the build-up of constant lip balm use and dry flaky lip skin makes my lips feel gross and gunky. If it's super gentle and every once in a while I think you will be okay (note, you can also buy lip scrub in Lush haha). I could go on and on. If I leave the house without lip balm/gloss I have to go buy a new one, so inadvertently I've ended up trying lots of different types -- as I'm sure all of us here have :)"
Aquaphor has been my best friend.
"Seronegative autoimmune diseases are fairly common, so the fact that your ANA and RF are negative doesn't mean much. Yes, I strongly feel that all of your symptoms stem from some type of autoimmune disease."

I recommend eliminating all gluten and dairy and seeing how you feel; and if you think those help you might even want to try the autoimmune Paleo diet.

"Was your disease precipitated by any event in particular? Perhaps a stomach bug, food poisoning, or a flu-like illness? Have you been tested for different types of viruses, like hepatitis C and Delta?"
"Did they do a full battery of lupus tests? check for anti-phospholipid syndrome? As far as kidneys and autoimmune diseases go, lupus is the first that comes to mind for that."

"But like the other post mentioned, seronegative is definitely a thing. it could be your disease is only just now catching up to the labwork where you've made enough of the antibodies to start showing up positive on tests. It's possible the labwork will differentiate itself over time. Though the obvious other question would be did you have the anti-SSA run again? To make sure it was legit, not some random error, etc."
"I have SS and SLE. It can be managed. My peripheral neuropathy mostly goes away if I use medical marijuana and stick to a ketogenic diet. I don't have a dairy sensitivity, but I avoid carbs and sugar as much as possible. It's great that you're seeing a rheumy, as it is important to monitor disease activity. I thought I was a ""hypochondriac,"" too, but the reason I suspected something might be really wrong all along was because all my symptoms were secondary to a legit illness. I am WAY healthier and happier now that I know what I have and how to manage it, though."
"Thanks for your response. No, it seemed to come out of nowhere. I'm remembering now that it actually started in my head with a week long tingling in my scalp. Then it moved to my feet and never changed since."

"I have been tested for hepatitus and it was negative. I guess I'm just worried about how this will end up. My neuro diagnosed me with idiopathic neuropathy and said that it's not uncommon to have neuropathy for no reason that resolves over time and never comes back. But with the positive anti-SSA it's like... well now what? I guess it's not idiopathic, it's something insidious and progressive, possible lupus, etc. So I can't just get this out of my head."
"I'm seeing a rhuematologist now who did another SSA test. We'll see how it goes. Obviously, I'm mostly just worried about the future. I went from having a neurologist tell me random neuropathies can be benign and go away over time to now wondering if I will develop a progressive, debilitating disease. Is it possible that a mild neuropathy will continue to be my only symptom?"
"Thanks for your insight. I saw the rheumatologist again yesterday. She doesn't think I have SS because she says the specific type of anti-SSA I have is inconclusive, that it's not ""the one that is associated with anything"" and also it's an incredibly weak positive. I don't have joint pain or fatigue or any typical symptoms of these illnesses. My ANA is still negative and all other blood tests, RA factor, sedimentation rate, anti-DNA, etc are negative."

"However, just based on my neuropathy symptom, which is just numbness and not painful, she still believes I have some mild inflammatory illness. Someone else in this thread or another suggested CIDP? That seems pretty scary, though I don't have weakness yet so I don't know. Either way, I was prescribed predisone to see if reducing inflammation in my body will make my neuropathy go away.... I'm not convinced and a little scared as the side effects of this drug seem pretty serious, but I guess we'll see what happens."

I have somewhat severe scoliosis so all along I had been assuming it was related somehow. In addition to the numbness in my feet I also get blisters and callouses and my gait is already altered from my spine deformity so I've always suspected my nerve symptoms somehow related to the change in weight distribution/balance from my spine. But I guess my doctors don't think this is the case.
"Do you have dry eye and/or dry mouth? What about fatigue? You should have an anti-dsDNA test done. If your disease is not autoimmune in nature, then it's probably the result of a viral pathogen. Unfortunately though, in either case, western doctors probably won't be of much help unless you go to see a highly renowned specialist in a major city and/or teaching college."
"If you have scoliosis and long-fiber PN you could have hereditary peripheral neuropathy, aka Charcot Marie Tooth. Wouldn't explain your bladder issues though."
"No dry eyes or mouth. Actually, I would say I have an excessively wet mouth. I'm constantly having to spit."

I have had an anti-dsDNA done and it was negative. I am currently in the care of Cornell University doctors in NYC who are apparently the leading specialists of neuropathy.

"Edit: oh, I forgot about fatigue. I don't feel I have an unreasonable amount of fatigue, no."
"Could be. But CMT usually causes weakness, right? I only have sensory symptoms, and hypereflexia. I'm also reading that CMT is usually demyelinating, whereas mine isn't. Also, while I have an extensive family history of autoimmune diseases, there is no history of CMT. I'll bring it up with my neuro, though."
"You can get spurts of very wet mouth (and eyes) in response to a lowered saliva, IIRC. Just because you haven't noticed your mouth going dry doesn't mean you don't have antibody action there. I didn't realize my eyes and mouth were abnormally dry until decades after it started happening. I know it was happening because a dry mouth side-effect to tricyclics affected me much worse than it would most people. It was too painful to continue the treatment, in fact."

"Neuropathy is a symptom of Sjogren's but also of many other autoimmune conditions, as you probably know. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are the other big ones."

"And don't discount the possibility that you just didn't use a great lab. Some labs seem to be ""more sensitive"" in getting a positive result. For instance, in the St. Louis area where I'm from, doctors have told me that Quest Labs are better than Lab Corp. Also, could just have been a bad test, bad procedure, etc. that could account for negatives. You just can't hang a diagnosis or lack of one, on one test, in other words."

"True hypochondria is pretty rare, but that doesn't mean you don't have it. I have to wonder whether you were responding to symptoms or issues you had but were hard to pin down. I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder about that, I guess, since I was called one for 15 years before being diagnosed with celiac and autoimmune thyroid issues. Medically, pronouncing someone with hypochondriasis is a really shitty thing to do given how hard AI diseases are to diagnose. It can really cause some awful emotional distress to feel badly and not be believed."
"hmm.  I think sensory symptoms only can happen. I mostly have sensory symptoms so far (I have CMT1a).  Moreover, there is an axonal form.  OTOH, the lack of family history tells against it.  On the other other hand, my family was totally in denial, given our mild case, and I kind of pushed everyone out of the closet.  But as you say, mention it to your neuro."
"CIDP would also be demyelinating, so you don't have that.  The ""D"" is for demyelinating."
"Thanks for your input. My rheumatologist clarified that I was anti-SSA/ro positive for the Ro52 (or maybe the 60, can't remember) variety which apparently has a less defined association with autoimmune disease, however she still thinks I have one because of my symptoms and diagnosed me with Nondifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease."

She referred me to an opthamologist to test for dry eye but they said my tear production was 100% normal.

"I've been thinking about my sensations of increased saliva and I wonder if it's not related to reflux. I also have a globus sensation and some mild heartburn... reflux can apparently be an autoimmune symptom but it can also be caused by nerve problems and well... stress. Which I have in spades. Anyway, no answers, but seems less definitively Sjogren's since I made this post."
"Would you care to share a little bit about your experience? I just want to be able to live a normal life. So far, all I have is numbness and tingling that jumps around from my toes to my thigh. It's annoying but I feel normal. If it started to become painful or affect my ability to walk, I don't know what I'd do."
"Interestingly, since I wrote this I've been have eye dryness.  In my case all my inflammatory markers are negative as well, though."

"CMT really varies. In my family most people seem to be pretty asymptomatic. I have painful numbness and tingling in my feet. My calves get tight and twitchy.  I'm on gabapentin and dealing so far, also using caffeine in coffee probably too much.  Looking into medical marijuana.  It's not awful. I still haven't arranged for PT and I'm hoping some kind of regular exercise beyond walking will help.  I've been using a walking stick, but honestly it's sort of just for moral support.  My walking is basically normal."

Some PNs are totally idiopathic.  In my case it was obvious looking back that we have an autosomal dominant high arched foot in my mom's family that was the clue to the underlying autosomal dominant mutation.  It was picked up on a commercial test as the most common mutation of them all.

I still wonder if something else is going on for me though.  It's so maddening.

"I wouldn't assume you have CMT though. You could just have some benign idiopathic long fiber thing!  Or it could be biomechanical, caused by scoliosis.  I'd talk to your neurologist if you haven't already.  I think whatever you have seems unlikely to get drastically worse."

"I get the most out of the Sjögren's Syndrome foundation and Sjögren's Syndrome alternative therapy groups on Facebook. I would ask about dietary changes and supplements that would reduce symptoms and have your thyroid, magnesium checked and get tested for celiac disease."
"I'm 22 and have been going through the diagnosing process and bouncing from doctor to doctor for about two years now. I JUST now found a treatment that has helped, after trying pretty much everything. Ask you doctor (mine was ophthalmologist) about taking a Borage oil supplement with GLA in it as well as taking vit B12 every day. I am not sure which one is working, or if it is both, but this is the ONLY method that has given me some relief for dry eye. There is no toxic upper limit with B12 and he said just because blood work says you're not ""deficient,"" doesn't mean you shouldn't take it. For example my level was around 410 (400 is considered normal I believe) and he said he wants me to be in the 1000s. So try those!"
"Before this, I have tried these methods which you can ask about:"
"- Restasis: on it for 10 months w no difference, and it's super expensive"

"- washing with Avenova eye scrub DOES help, but doesn't cure it obviously. Baby shampoo is a cheaper option to rinse with."

"Ok so that's a lot of info, BUT if it comes down to it and you've tried it all like I had, definitely bring up these options to try. It can't hurt and I wish someone had told me these things before I saw 5 different specialists."

Good luck!!


Off topic but how was your experience with the lip biopsy?
Great! Thank you so much.
"Thank you, I'll be sure to bring this up!"
"Quick question: I've been tested for 'abnormal antibodies' or something like that and gluten came out fine (lactose was problematic, amongst other things). Does this rule out Celiac or should I have another test done?"
"Not that bad. I'm a bit afraid of needles, so the anasthesia wasn't any fun. Apart from that it was just mildly uncomfortable. It healed up pretty quickly as well."
Are you getting the biopsy?

"I honestly don't know. I think there are two ways to test for celiac, a blood test, though I'm not sure that was the right one, or they scope you and see if your intestines are damaged or not. Maybe /r/celiac can help?"

"A word of caution though - you can test negative for celiac disease and still benefit from going gluten free. Many people with autoimmune disease do. Check out /r/glutenscience or poke around in /r/glutenfree. Being gluten free takes care of about 90% of my pain and symptoms. Lots of help to be had here on reddit and facebook, and of course I'll be glad to answer what questions I can."
Thank you for being a polite user on reddit!

Thanks will keep that in mind!
I would definitely want to see my autoantibody levels if I were you. I dealt with several condescending clinicians before I finally got diagnosed with SLE and Sjogren's. My quality of life is infinitely better now that I know how to manage it.
You could send your records to the clinic and let them decide if they want to bring you in for an evaluation.
"Before jumping to Sjogren's, it's important to look at medications as many can cause dryness. Possible side effects of bydureon, invokana, metformin, simvistatin, and levothyroxine are, depending on which one, dry mouth, eyes and/or skin. Are there other medications for those conditions that don't have dryness as possible side effect?"

"That being said, it may be prudent to request blood tests for Sjogren's, though it is possible to be seronegative and have Sjogren's. Lip biopsy is often considered the gold standard for determination. Even if you do have Sjogren's, one, some or all of your current medications, as well as diabetes itself, could be exacerbating the dryness."
"There's a Sjogren's clinic in my city--after hearing a lot of misdiagnosis horror stories, I think I'd start there."

"What kind of management do you do?  I was under the impression that the only thing you can do is treat the symptoms, which I'm already doing, or some kind of biological, which I desperately want to avoid.  From reading the accounts of people's issues, it sounds dreadful; is it a progression that most people have, or is there a lot of individual variation in how SS affects each person?"
"Unfortunately one of my best friends got cancer from biologics, so I'm also extremely wary of them. It's an inflammatory disease, so anything you do for inflammation will get at the root of the problem. For medications I take plaquenil for autoimmune disease and adderall for adhd (probably really brain fog). I also take MCT oil and ketones to support therapeutic ketosis (can be achieved through ketogenic diet or intermittent fasting), collagen for connective tissue health and leaky gut, methyl-cobalamin (B12) which is great for mood and energy, curcumin, and omega-3's. I also avoid sugar and carbs (especially gluten) as much as possible and get exercise from practicing yoga and walking about 3 miles per day."

"Thanks, I'll check on it."
Oh and CBD! And regular marijuana- super helpful for inflammatory disease.
"There is more to the diagnosis than the antibody tests. While most people with the disease will have positive antibody tests, there are many that won't. Besides, a positive antibody test does not mean someone definitively has Sjogren's. It just means that the patient might have Sjogren's and that further testing may be required. Some of the other tests aren't specifically related to Sjogren's, such as the Rheumatoid Factor (RF), but they can be helpful regarding the overall picture of a patient. Some tests, such as a lip biopsy, salivary tests, and eye tests, can be much more helpful in the diagnosis. A doctor will consider all of these things including their exam of the patient before making a diagnosis. [Here is a link](https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/sjogren/start/2) that shows and explains many of the tests people will have done when a doctor suspects a patient might have Sjogren's. What tests a doctor uses will depend a lot on the doctor's training, the lab they work with, the patient's signs and symptoms, and a few other factors."
"I was just diagnosed with Sjogren's yesterday but am negative for antibodies. Based on my symptoms, the doctor started me on Plaquenil and Meloxicam about a month ago and it has really helped my symptoms. So, I think the doc diagnosed based on a combination of symptoms and that they responded to the medication."
I don't have the Sjogrens antibodies but I have everything else.
Thanks super helpful.
Did he do any other tests or just based on symptoms?
"Based on my symptoms, which basically checked all the boxes for Sjogren's, my doctor started me on the Plaquenil and Meloxicam. He did extensive bloodwork but I didn't get the results back until my second visit. Based on how well I was responding to the medications and how my symptoms fit, he diagnosed me. He also told me that about 30% of people with Sjogren's don't have the antibodies, so he wasn't too concerned with my results being negative."
"Thank you, this is really helpful."
"My rheumatologist said that same, or maybe even higher percentage because a lot of these folks go undiagnosed. I'm also diagnosed based on Ophthalmologist findings, symptoms, and response to medication."
You're welcome!
"Look into LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone).  It has amazing results for a large number of people, myself included."

"If you're on FB, there's a group with a few thousand folks."

https://www.facebook.com/groups/sjogrensandLDN/?fref=nf

"I take 8 fish oil pills a day, in an attempt to reduce inflammation. It helps. Not as much as Aleve, but, unlike Aleve, it doesn't murder my stomach. My joint pain also responds well to glucosamine chondroitin, although I've heard that depends on the cause of the pain (which is unknown for me). Try to avoid inflammatory things like sugar and alcohol."
Have you actually tried plaquenil? I have bad side effects from steroids but not plaquenil. I had a mild upset stomach for a few weeks but I'm fine now a few months in.
Elimating gluten took care of about 95% of my pain. I couldn't even function. You'll get a lot of feedback from the Facebook groups SS alternative therapies too.

"Edit: spelling and to say, I can email you my regimen, if you want. My PCP gave it to me bcase it caused her ra patient to go into remission. Always happy to share, it's just diet recs with exercise and mediation."
"I have, and the side effects were too awful. Blurred vision and awful headaches. Way fun."
"Going GF was a pointless exercise in futility and missing delicious pasta. :) It didn't help or hurt either way, so it didn't make sense to continue after 2 months of nada."

"I definitely appreciate the insight though! That's the shitty thing about all of the autoimmune stuff: your treatments are ineffective for me, and mine for you, and all of us have totally different triggers. Yay."
Yay! Chronic pain and misery for everybody!!!!

"Srsly though, check out that group, good stuff."
Important point. Gluten sensitivity is a very common characteristic of autoimmune diseases in general.
"Whoaaaa. This blew my mind, thanks for the comment. I seem to have both. Does that indicate the autoimmune disease is particularly bad or anything like that?"
"Not necessarily. But it is definitely a bummer - trust me, I feel your pain."

"We have found leaky gut in every autoimmune disease tested.  The immune dysregulation which takes place in autoimmune disease likely stems from gut dysbiosis. Therefore, a broadly nutrient-dense and anti-inflammatory diet like the autoimmune protocol should improve symptom severity in all autoimmune diseases."

TL;DR Everyone with autoimmune disease should be on the autoimmune protocol diet.
"Wow, that's exactly the type of information I was looking for, thank you. I recently lost a lot of weight and am basically in the mindset that I can tackle anything if I learn enough about it. Do you know if something like SS can be cured entirely? I ask because you said the severity of symptoms can be improved, and I'd like to start measuring/getting to measurable improvements."

"Am looking at the diet of course too, thank you."
"I realize this is very late, but in the odd chance that you will still read this: will the Autoimmune Protocol still be benificial for people with ""Non-autoimmunal Sjögrens""?   That's the diagnosis I got with dry eyes, dry mouth and a positive lipbiopsy, but negative bloodwork. Thank you in advance!"
"You are very welcome. Your mindset is much like mine: with enough knowledge and willpower, anything is possible."

"While the autoimmune paleo/protocol diet (and especially going gluten-free) will likely improve symptoms of those with Sjogren's, I know of only one treatment that seems to cure it: mesenchymal stem cells. Here is a link to an article that discusses them:"
http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/120/15/3142.short

"The issue is that with some people, symptoms seem to come back after a period of time. So while mesenchymal stem cells are incredibly promising, more research is needed to determine the difference between long-term responders and those who only receive a fleeting benefit."

"Basically, the treatment consists of an intravenous infusion of 1 to 2 million mesenchymal stem cells per kilogram of body weight, which for me ends up being 70,000,000 cells. Once inside the body, the cells exert their immunomodulatory activity, broadly upregulating T regulatory cells and reducing the pathological inflammation."

"If you want to get involved in this type of treatment, you can check for clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov. I'm not sure if there are presently any trials for Sjogren's alone, but you may have luck finding some for celiac disease."
"Yes, it probably will help. Keep in mind, even when your bloodwork is negative, you could still have Sjogren's."

"In fact, if you have dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue, and brain fog, I'd be willing to bet that you have Sjogren's. And if you also have Raynaud's phenomenon, that's when I start approaching 99% certainty."
"Very interesting! Thank you, I will see if I can give that study a look. I have a friend who's a rheumatologist and he'd probably be interested to see it too."
"The way my doctor put it I do have Sjögrens, but a variant with a slightly better prognosis. He calls this non-autoimmunal Sjögrens, but I guess this is the same as sero-negative Sjögrens...? Thank you for your post, I will ask my GP if a celiac test is wise."
"Before going through the song and dance of getting tested for transglutaminase antibodies, you should be able to tell whether gluten free works for you within about two weeks of a trial diet. Just make sure you aren't inadvertently consuming gluten, like from corn starch in supplements or from bread crumbs."
I get it in the mornings sometimes but I think it is more related to anxiety and sinus drainage from allergies.
"I get nausea, and although is not terrible, I get it almost every morning."
Do you take Plaquenil? That's been known to make some people nauseous.
"I don't take plaquenil, I haven't been diagnosed yet just waiting on the bloods to come back. I have crohns which is in remission but the nausea, fatigue and joint pain is ongoing. Just wondering if it could be related to the swollen glands/dry mouth and sjorgens symptoms"
i get really bad nausea in the mornings as well as reflux after most meals :( sometimes nausea turns into actual vomiting and there isnt an anti sickness in the world that can stop it
To start: I am not a doctor. Just a person with Sjogren's.

"Everyone's body is different, but honestly if the only things you're experiencing are a few short periods of dry mouth, it's far more likely that it's being caused by something else, such as the side effect of medication you're taking, allergies, anxiety, dehydration, etc.  If increasing your water intake cleared it up before, try doing that again. If it goes away after increasing your water intake, you're probably just dehydrated. Most people don't drink enough water, so it's pretty easy to get dehydrated and think you're sick with all kinds of things."

"That said, if you're really that concerned, see your primary care doctor or an rheumatologist, and see if they think it's appropriate to test for the antibody. Based on what you've said, my guess is that they probably won't. If in the future, you start getting other symptoms, such as chronic fatigue, chronic unexplained joint pain (this was the red flag that sent me to the doctor), dry eyes, etc you can always go back."
"From a purely etiological standpoint, the large large majority of people diagnosed with Sjogren's are older women.  The probability that you, as a young male have it with such minimal symptoms is quite low.  From a purely statistical standpoint, I would say around 1%.  That's not to say that it's impossible, just statistically unlikely."
"You should be tested for HSV-1, HTLV-1/2, and EBV. You'll probably have EBV, might have HSV-1, and you probably won't have HTLV-1/2. All have been implicated in dry mouth syndrome, and knowing whether they are involved or not may have ramifications on your treatment protocol."
"Thank you. I felt especially down today so thank you for restating the unlikeliness. Hard part is just... What else? But that's not a good way to think about this, I'll see a specialist again soon and find comfort in the  fact that the numbers are in my favor."
I do not have dry eyes though?
Also... Why do you think I have hsv? Or the latter which is very rare.
Could be all sorts of things but among the last things you want it to be is an autoimmune disease so keep your head up!  Just remember Occam's Razor: the most simple explanation is usually the right one!  It could be that you're just having some dry mouth or a severe allergic reaction.  Have you moved within the last 6 months?
Viruses may play a role in the etiology of Sjogren's:

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/26962705
Before my symptoms started in December I actually had moved into a new place. I suppose it could be environmental. I was thinking about going out or the house for a week after finals  and seeing what happens.
So this is your first spring in a new place which means Occam's Razor says it's probably just an allergic reaction to something new in your environment.  Hopefully that's all it is!
Hopefully! Thanks.
"I'm in the process of trying to get a diagnosis, so I've had lots of appointments with my dentist, ENT doc, PCP... then a neck CT checking for potential salivary stones, etc, so I've had to take off from work a bit. I'm lucky because my boss is a family friend, so he is very understanding, and I'm able to be honest with him about my health issues. In order to be accomodating, I try to schedule my appointments as far ahead as I can to get good appointment times and to schedule on days I know I don't have any projects due."

"If I can get the earliest appointment time (8 AM, usually), then I can be at work by 10 usually (I have a 40 min commute). I just plan on staying later that day, so if I eat lunch at my desk and leave at 6 I've still technically worked a full 8 hour day. The same goes if you can get the latest slot possible. a 4:30 slot means I can get to work at 7:30 and still work 8 hours and get to my appointment on time. For appointments that you can schedule far in advance like the rheumatologist and immunologists you might be able to get these coveted appointment spots."

"Another thing that helps is letting my boss know a couple days ahead of time if I know I'm going to be late, but I know my scenario is special because my boss is especially friendly/lenient with me. Not sure if that was helpful at all, but no one else had said anything, so I thought I'd chip in!"
"I personally either use Toms (fluoride free version), or make my own.  For homemade: 50/50 coconut oil and baking soda, and you can add drops of essential oil (make sure it doesn't irritate your mouth first), and some people crush up some Tums for the calcium.  You could use much less baking soda, it just won't have as much polishing power.  If you want to use fluoride, kid's mouthwashes often have it in them.  I have sicca, as well as various unpinned down autoimmune issues, and these both work well for me.  I don't seem to have as dry a mouth when I use these.  I still wake up with a sticky mouth, and my tongue stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth, but my throat isn't as sore and my tongue doesn't feel raw in the morning anymore.  Also, you should be working with a dentist, as chronic dry mouth causes dental decay.  Best wishes!"
Sensodyne. The kind that doesn't have SLS.
Tell your dentist about the problem your having and ask if he/she can suggest a toothpaste. He also can give you a prescription toothpaste.
"I use this stuff. Don't know if it will help with your problem, though:"
http://www.biotene.com/products/toothpaste
I use a children's toothpaste. It comes in tubes that look like a big crayon. It has a fruit flavour and no sodium laurel sulfate. It seems to work for me. I also rinse with Biotene a couple of times a day and only chew fruit flavored rather than mint gum
"baking soda + coconut oil, or just baking soda."
"While sleeping, you might want to consider using a vaporizer to add moisture to the air. Also, you can ask your doctor about a prescription for Evoxac or Salagen which are saliva producing medications. Both of those strategies made a world of difference for me!"
"Thank you! I actually have an appointment soon, so I will."
"I am unsure if it would work for someone with Sjogren's whose Meibomian glands may actually be destroyed due to the disease and not just dysfunctioning. It also isn't laser treatment, but a intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. Significant difference between the two. I would love for it to work though. My dry eyes are very severe and I have not had success with either plugs or eye drops."
"I would love to find out more about this, my mom has had her tear ducts plugged, and they are better but still very dry"

"Please tell more. I have very dry eyes and because of that I know have corneal erosion, which is extremely painful. I'm having my tear ducts plugged  next week, but fear it's not enough to prevent  the erosions."
"It's been awhile since I read the dry eye literature, but this sounds like b.s. At best and potentially harmful for you at worst."

What is the procedure called?
"This is what I'm concerned about, that is not suitable for us. I did find the link to this on a Sjogrens help site, which made me hopeful. I'll go for the consultation and see what they say."

"You're right tho, it's not a laser treatment but ipl. Apparently they discovered this when treating skin issues on people."
"I saw it on the news, the website is dry-eyes.com.au. Wondering why this is not more widely known?"
"Only heard about it recently, the website is dry-eyes.com.au, seems very promising! I've been scared to have plugs fitted so this sounds great to me! Will post an update when I've had my consultation first treatment next week."
"It's Intense Pulsed Light, IPL treatment. In what way are you thinking it's a harmful treatment?"
"YES. And I'm on mobile so I won't write this long scree, but this is the best thing for my eye symptoms (and helps my other symptoms too.)"

Good-bye gummy eyes!!!

http://eatinghorror.com/blog/2014/03/04/fish-stock/
"I have Sjogren's and my eyes tear all the flippin' time because they are severely dry and easily irritated. My tears are useless because they don't have the proteins and things tears need to adhere to the eyes and provide the benefits they should. So, my eyes are always irritated, dry, and itchy. This also leads to problems focusing. I don't have the gummy eye issue as bad as what you're describing, but it does happen. Sunlight, wind, and cold air are the biggest irritants for me - particularly sunlight and other bright lights. I use eye drops (without preservatives) a lot and they help quite a bit. Just search for Sjogren's and dry eyes. There are some eye drops called Fresh Kote which have worked the best for me (although I have issues with the preservatives in it). I take those with preservative free eye drops that I can use several times a day. See an eye doctor about it. There are some treatments for dry eye that you may find helpful. I have tried plugs, but they didn't work for me. Tried Restasis, but I had a reaction to it. Some medications can make the dryness worse."

This [link](http://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms/dry-eyes) may be helpful to explain the issues with dry eyes and some of the treatments.
"Thanks! Good (not good) to know that dry eyes, aren't literally ""dry"" for everyone. I shall check your link out."
"Thank you! I have an opthamologist appt in October for a standard checkup for some medication I am taking for the MS and I will ask him to do the tests for Sjorgen's. Pretty sure that will be easier than trying to convince my GP I am sick as they don't seem to want to work with me to work out how to feel better - tell them you are freezing and your toes are going purple/black in the shower and your eyeballs are aching and you can't stand the light and they are like ""meh, your blood tests for liver/kidney look fine. You are running a slight fever...maybe that's why you feel cold"""
"Very lucky to have some doctors that suggested dietary changes off the bat. Omega fats are good for those of us with AI disease, and I find fish and sea buckthorn pills especially good for our sicca symptoms. Sea Buckthorn pills also give me instant relief for my eyes. Allergy season is the worse too, all summer it's like waking up with my eyes glued shut and gummy discharge. They do get dry at times too, but discharge is a way bigger issue for me."

"A lot of people on the Sjogren's fb groups complain when I suggest this fish stock but I think it tastes great. It's not like eating a bunch of anchovies, it's like drinking soup. I love it, and i hope you do to, and I hope it helps you."
"I've had two children since my diagnosis, most recently last week. During pregnancy I have remission of my symptoms as long as I take my plaquinel everyday. It is a very welcome reprieve from the pain and fatigue. Every person is different though. Some people have more problems during pregnancy. About 3-6 weeks after pregnancy my hormones drop so quickly that I will flare. The main thing is to be prepared for that flare ad work with my doctors to stay on top of my symptoms. Pregnancy with sjorgrens is possible as long as you have a plan and great care from your doctors. I'm even able to breastfeeding with the medications I'm on! Hope this was helpful. If you have any other questions let me know. :)"
A number of people have said they thought pregnancy triggered their SS...
"I've not been pregnant and I really don't plan on it knowing I have this. I'm just not there physically. I have more than one autoimmune disease and I can't even contemplate having the energy to raise a child of my own. I just don't have it. But my doctor she did tell me it was possible but that you had to watch out for blood related problems more, platelet issues mostly. You would be probably considered a high risk pregnancy but if you're up to it otherwise they can monitor you fairly closely and make sure you are okay."
"I echo what MamaMayl said. She said everything that's very important and my high-risk twin pregnancy was successful. I encourage you to reach out to families that are willing to help out with the baby in case your postpartum hormones drops where you are exhausted. ""Sleep when baby sleeps"" has always been the old tried and true adage; it does work in our cases. Rest a lot. In my case, I limited the visits so I wouldn't feel obligated to be a hostess to my guests. It worked for me as I had two premature babies and I was breastfeeding them until I switched to formula. Hope this helps."
"""High risk pregnancy"" isn't the case with Sjogren's. The issue with Sjogren's is that a woman has a slightly higher risk of having a child with fetal heart block. Only 7% of sufferers develop Sjogren's before age 45. So what we're looking at there is data complicated by age of birth mother as well."
"There are AI where having children is high risk. I think some forms of dysautonomia are pretty devastating to the ability to have kids, for instance. So I understand if your other AI fall under the category of high risk."
"Not normally no, but as with Lupus, with SS, you can have platelet issues and they can complicate things. One of my friend also has SS, in her case just SS. We met in a support group actually. Nothing else so far they can tell, but she also developed platelet issues and her GYN definitely slotted her as high risk a couple of years ago when she had her first. There's a better than average chance of miscarriage if you have developed platelet issues with SS. It's more common in people who have Lupus but it can happen in SS too..."
Do you think the jaw pain might be radiating from your submandibular gland? The only time I have lower jaw pain is when my submandibular gland's saliva production comes to a crawl.
"I had a lot of jaw pain back when I was first diagnosed, and it was definitely related to salivation. Whenever I tried to eat, drink, or even put a straw or fork in my mouth I would get excruciating pain in my lower jaw that I could feel all the way up in my ears. My mom thought it was my parotid glands because I also had noticeable swelling in those areas whenever I began to salivate. My doctors and dentists dismissed it as fibromyalgia."
"I don't experience it anymore. I've been on generic plaquenil for the past two years and it has improved my condition quite a bit. During the time I was having the pain, I would just have to wait for it to pass and eventually I would be able to eat comfortably. I also found that taking ibuprofen eased the pain a bit."

[deleted]
"It might not be what youre talking about, but I mentioned my jaw pain to my chiropractor and she totally made it feel better. Did a little massage and some adjustments and it's all better now. She's been a godsend for a lot of my health issues."
"Thanks foe the reply. I am on Cellcept and a small dose of prednisone. I am very unfamiliar with SS. The lupus I have under control but, I am having difficulty understand  the Sjogrens."
"I don't think so unfortunately.  There was once the possibility that I had plaquenil eye toxicity, and I was told to simply stop taking it without replacing it with anything.  Tests showed it was not toxicity though so I was able to start it again."
"I think there  are ways to supplement your scripts, I think there was a post here or in /r/autoimmune a few months ago when the price started to soar, I shared it with the SS Facebook groups."
Sometimes I would get given Quinoric instead of Plaquenil.
Can you get to Canada or Mexico? It's much much cheaper and same manufacturers.
http://www.rxresource.org/prescription-assistance/sanofi-aventis-patient-assistance-program.html
http://www.rxresource.org/prescription-assistance/sanofi-aventis-patient-assistance-program.html
At my last apt my rhuemy told me I either need to be on plaquenil or a low dose steroid to prevent the disease from progressing.
That's problem two of the story. My cheapo Obamacare health insurance I've got while on unemployment doesn't cover the eye doctor visits I have to have every 6 mos if I take the stuff. Thanks for answering though!
"Didn't think of that. Checking into the Quinoric, too."

"I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I've found both the good and the bad here. There will be rants during flare ups, there will be people experiencing new to them symptoms looking for advice and there will be people doing well sharing that."

"The groups are great places to learn about all aspects of this disease. It also gives a place to ask questions, get support and virtual hugs."
"Yes, you will read about severe cases of the disease but this is helpful also. There were symptoms I didn't know belonged under the sjogren's umbrella until I read about them. This helped to know what do about it."

"Kind of rambling, hope it helps some."
"I've found that when people are doing well they don't tend to use online support as much, but when they are sick or in a flare they may respond to every little thing."
"I agree with the other two...I think most reach out for that online support during a flare or when things are particularly rough. Comparatively, I'm doing really well with SS/life in general and I frequently stay away from those groups because the constant venting brings me down. (I don't think people shouldn't vent or look for help in those forums, I just can't let myself get caught up in their struggles.)"
"A lot of stuff you read is so scary. I belong to a group on facebook--it's a Mixed Connective Tissue Disease group, I just happen so be more Sjogrens than anything else other than a little RA--and every so often we get a terrified new member who just read online that the life expectancy is 10 years. That old chestnut keeps flying around and never seems to go away. So we have to calm the newbie down and let him/her know that you CAN live the rest of your life and you can manage pretty well once you find a good rheumatologist and hopefully not lose your job and health insurance. Right now that just happened to me but I won't rant about that here."
This is understandable to think this way - you might not have the disease in which case you are engaging in something you don't need to engage in - worrying about the prognosis of a disease you don't have.

As someone who has sjogren's syndrome let me put it to you straight. This is a bad ass disease. The people's problems you read on the forum - those are real people with real lives just like you and their struggle is very real. They aren't weak willed whiners. They aren't seeking the sympathy of those who can't understand. Their struggle might cause yourself to momentarily thank god yours isn't that bad... but the reality for those of us with autoimmune disease is that things can always get much worse. And that it's far more likely for things to get much worse for us than it is for an average person who does not suffer a chronic disease.

I pray you don't have it. I wouldn't wish what I have on anyone else.
"Mate, I'm 24 and got myself diagnosed this year, but mine's farily mild. My eyes barely produce any moisture and my mouth is so bad it's caused dental problems for me, but my skin doesn't hurt in the sun and my joints aren't too bad. point being, it won't necessarily stop your life. I chew gum/use pastels from my doctor, I have gel eyedrops and sunglasses for my photophobia and except for bad days I function as well as I ever have."
Just remember this - You have Sjogrens; Sjogrens doesn't have you.
"I have had this issue, and in fact it is the main issue that led to my diagnosis. It comes and goes, typically with my hormonal cycle. I use lube when it the issue comes up, but it doesn't help much. The most effective lube I have found is unrefined coconut oil, but this is only okay to use if you don't rely on condoms since it can degrade them. I wish I had a better solution, but all I can say is try to figure out if your cycle affects it and try to find a doctor who specializes in female sexual pain. I have not found this magical doctor yet, but I can hope."
"Rhwallac, painful intercourse comes with the territory of sjogren's for many of us but if I find the right partner I still have frequent sex. There is more focus on me on my partner's pleasure than my own. This is how I deal with it and maintain a close sexual bond with a man."

I like to use coconut oil. I also have to be with a partner I really trust isn't a total dumb ass about pulling out in time. I can't take any form of birth control because of my allergies to it. Having an autoimmune disease is basically playing life on legendary hard status.
"Luckily this isn't really a problem for me, but my gyno gave me advice in case it becomes one. She said if I got dryness symptom on the inside, try using Replens which is available in the women's section of drug and grocery stores. If dryness on the outside, she said apply plain old Vaseline which is a cheaper option, as Replens is basically Vaseline but packaged for insertion. I don't think it's intended for intercourse use, though, and especially not with a condom as it's oil based."
"I was originally diagnosed with vulvar vaginitis about two years ago, and no one could explain my symptoms or help. A month ago I went in for a neurological appointment regarding vertigo and my blood work came back positive for Sjogrens. I saw that vaginitis can be a main symptom, and it all started to make sense. I have an important with a vulvar specialist in June to talk with her about Sjogrens."

"I will try out the coconut oil, do you usually put some on and wait or just got for it?"

Thanks!
Thanks for the response!

I have been with my SO for 3 years and he has been through this with me since the beginning. He is an extremely kind and caring individual who always puts me first.

"Sometimes I feel terrible because he knows I am in pain but I will lie and tell him it's fine. He feels like he is hurting me and it isn't even his fault. Most of the time I compartmentalize the pain but I know he is aware of how I am feeling. I just wish there was relief for the vaginal pain, everything else I can deal with."
I tend to incorporate the oil into foreplay.
The first time I was in pain I didn't tell my husband...I was in pain for a full week. I'm pretty sure we all have higher pain tolerances with this disease but don't sacrifice your health for his feelings! It sounds like your SO's wonderful and I'm sure he'd appreciate you telling him.

"Since I've been more open with my husband, we've found ways to deal with it. We use sliquid (a water-based lube) and start REALLY slow. I've also found some relief afterwards in using those Charmin wipes (basically baby wipes for adults) for a few days after sex. It's a lot more bearable than toilet paper and I actually ""wear"" one on top of a pad for a while to help with the after-itching and burning. I honestly don't know if the chemicals are good/bad but it's the only thing I've found that relieves the symptoms and I haven't had negative effects yet."
Good luck!
I have been meaning to invest in those Charmin wipes! I was thinking about picking up a pack from Costco!!!

I will check out the sliquid too!!

It is seriously so nice to hear that other people are having the same issues I am! Just out of curiosity do you have any of the main symptoms such as dry eyes and mouth?
Not really...MAYBE dry eyes. My biggest complaint is/was knee pain and fatigue (gotta give my primary physician some mad props for believing me and testing me for EVERYTHING!). I've done a lot of reading and sometimes wonder if it's just not advanced enough to be really noticeable or that I'll start to imagine the symptoms.

Do you have the trademark symptoms?

I found it really interesting that dry eyes and mouth stand out the most.

For me it was the vaginitis that brought me in...of all places a neurologist diagnosed me because I have recurrent vertigo. She ran a ton of blood tests and discovered it.

I also tend to have very dry skin and get unknown rashes a lot on my hands and neck. I just use a topical steroid cream for that hoping it works...which is normally doesn't.

"Interesting! I've also always had dry skin and sporadic rashes but they always go away so I've never bothered to get them checked out. I'm pretty quick to shrug things off like that, both because I can't afford to see the doctor that often just to be told I'm fine, and, of course, I think I'm invincible :). In hearing how different everyone's stories are, I'm amazed someone was able to connect the dots to identify this strange syndrome."
I have the trademark symptoms. But I had for years before seeing the eye and mouth symptoms had issues with dryness in my vagina causing infections because that area is supposed to self-clean. Coconut oil inhibits fungal growth and is affordable.
"I started taking Plaquenil in December. Had a HUGE flare Feb-March. Was really discouraged the Plaquenil wasn't going to work, even though it can take 6 months to kick in. About 2 weeks ago, it started working. I'm so excited. The painful joints, fatigue and brain fog that forced me to lay around until about noon each day has subsided so much."

Hope you find something to help you find relief.
"Sleeping at least nine hours a night helps me with really all my symptoms (especially fatigue), but I can't always do that, being a graduate student. I've also found that avoiding food products containing processed/enriched flours and sugars makes me feel less fatigued. Sleeping in my water bed alleviates most of the muscle aches I accrue during the day. And I'm planning to move to a more humid climate to help with the dryness."
"I have noticed that the use of Turmeric pills (2000mg taken per day), and magnesium pills (400mg every evening) have made a huge impact on my symptoms.  Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory, and Magnesium helps to reduce muscle twitches and restless leg syndrome in the evenings"
"honestly, prednisone makes me feel great. but i try to stay away from it."
"I definitely agree with the eye drops. I have pretty bad dry mouth so I use Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash and I have an overnight Topical creme that I put on my teeth and gums and is safe to swallow. (it's called GC MI Paste Plus) My dentist gave it to me and I find it pretty helpful. All of them are mint flavored and I also chew mint sugarfree gum to keep my mouth moist, because fruity flavors make my mouth hurt or get sores. I also recently finished 4 months of bi-monthly physical therapy to help strengthen some of my joints because due to the pain I have, I tend not to be overly active, making going up the stairs painful sometimes. The Physical therapy has been so helpful and if you like swimming, water therapy is a lot less stressful on joints. Just make sure you have your doctor recommend one that is specialized in your specific symptoms. It won't make the pain go away, but it can and has reduced my joint pain, specific joints when doing specific activities."
I also use various heating pads and flexible icepacks for different aches and pains.
"I can't take anything for mine, except the odd Tylenol for pain, and even that I have to watch it very closely as my liver is very finicky about that. About the only thing that helps besides the lubricants of various kinds is blue ice blocks. I keep a lot of them in the freezer to use as needed for gland pain etc. I wrap one in a tea towel and ice my face several times a day when it gets bad. Sometimes I even sleep with them. :P"
I have to sleep at least 9 hours too! I have to be really firm with those I live with and go out with that I have a bedtime.
Humidity really helps! Let's all move to Hawaii.
...I wish.
glad I'm not the only one with RLS. It has to be linked to the AI syndromes somehow. Can you explain more about the turmeric?
"Tumeric works a lot like NSAIDS in the body, but you have to be able to tolerate it. I can't. Food allergy thing, darn it."
The pain I get is a bit different from yours but I've found just simple knee sleeves (black with hole over knee ) to be helpful. If you haven't already I'd also look into good foot support. I'm sorry your pains been so bad!
"I use a sleeve like mrspaprika. You can get them at the drug store. I also like turmeric instrmead of Tylenol, not like you were asking."
Thanks! I'll definitely look into sleeves and better shoes/supports. The pain sucks but I know it's part of my life now so I'm trying to proactively manage it and stay positive.
What test were you given?

"So my secret is I've never actually tested positive for SS either, but had an eye infection for 6 months, chronic dry mouth, chronic pain, fatigue, so my rheum dx'ed me with Sjogren's. I did test positively for connective tissue disease, which is a test for about 200 AI diseases, including SS."

"Constipation is definitely part of the package. Still working on that one, but as far as dry mouth overnight: oral hygiene is a must, especially before bed. I use a waterpik, sonacare and switch between biotene mouthwash and also a fluoride rinse. Salt and baking soda rinse will help you with your mouth ulcer. My PCP gave me a whole dietary regimen that has eliminated most of my symptoms, except for the constipation. I also take Sea Buckthorn for my eyes, and they are finally, all the time moist, it is a miracle. I would be happy to pm my regimen to you, just veggies and fruits, some extra spices, exercise, meditation. I am pretty much ""back to normal."""
"The most modest estimate (the one published on the Sjögren's Foundation website) is 30% of people with it will test negative for SS-A/B. A lip biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosis, so if you want a definitive answer, request this. If your doctor needs some convincing, there are abstracts on PubMed about how common false negatives are in blood work for Sjögren's."

"Additionally, the doctor should run more autoantibody tests to see if you are positive for any other autoantibodies than SS-A/B. You could have Sjögren's secondary to something else, or you could have an atypical presentation of Sjögren's. Was your ANA level tested?"

"I am providing a link with various labs and how often they are found to be positive in SS patients. Looking at it, you'll see about just as many patients with confirmed Sjögren's have elevated rheumatoid factor as have elevated SS-A."

http://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens-syndrome/diagnosis
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20646416/
Anti-SS-A and B.  Both results say <1.
"Yes pleeeeease send me your regimen!  I'm all for as few medications as possible. Also I'm wondering if my rheumatologist will give me the diagnosis regardless of blood tests anyway... i was looking through my results over the last 18 months and realized she's tested me 3 times, so she must be thinking it's there.  Maybe the new symptoms will make it official."
I had a low positive ANA and elevated RF a year and a half ago before I saw my rheumatologist.
Those levels can change. Diagnosing SS can be rather controversial. Here's something I wrote last year with the sources-
"Testing- Being properly diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome can be difficult. The average time between the onset of SS and a diagnosis is 4.7 years. Part of this delay is that there isn’t a single test that can confirm a diagnosis of SS and that it can appear differently in different patients. Instead doctors depend on several tests and a physical examination. Blood tests includes blood tests for ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody), RF (Rheumatoid Factor), SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La), IGs (Immunoglobulins) and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate). Ophthalmologic tests for SS include Schirmer Test to measures tear production and Rose Bengal and Lissamine Green Eyedrops to examine the surface of the eye for dry spots. Dental test for SS include salivary flow which measures the amount of saliva produced, the salivary scintigraphy which is a nuclear medicine test that measures salivary gland function and a salivary gland biopsy (usually in the lower lip) which confirms inflammatory cell (lymphocytic) infiltration of the minor salivary glands."

"Have these levels been rechecked? I'm not sure if you looked at the links and saw this, but RF is found in Sjogren's patients."

"If your SS-A/B levels aren't elevated, the only way to definitively diagnose SS is with a biopsy. Some people (and doctors) prefer to skip the biopsy and treat the symptoms. I can see the benefits of this approach, but personally, I like to have objective facts."
"Oops, I forgot to mention I'd already had a positive ANA and RF previously. My ophthalmologist has also already told me I have dry eyes.  After looking back through my results, my rheumatologist has tested my SSA/B multiple times, so I wonder if she's waiting for those to be positive before giving me an official diagnosis. My symptoms have really gone nuts in the last couple weeks so I'm definitely going to request that she test me again!"
"Nope, I'm hoping she'll check them again at my appointment in April though.  I like to have objective facts and a diagnosis on paper too, so it will make me very happy if I can get a real answer finally!"
"Hey,"
I'm a 30 year old female with Sjogren's. What the other individual stated on here is correct: the lip biopsy is the gold standard in establishing a definitive diagnosis for Sjogren's. It's how mine was diagnosed. I have a negative ANA and no Sjogren's Antibodies. I do have Positive RF and elevated sed rate (inflammation). So diagnosis can be very tricky.
"SS can cause swollen lymph nodes. I would guess this will show up in your blood work as inflammation. Personally I have problems like this in my armpits most of the time. The other thing to know, but not panic about, is that SS puts you at a higher risk of several types of cancers including lymphoma. You'll find studies if you search. If you should delay your test is probably a good question for your doctor."
"Can you give us more details on your symptoms? I know that often, viruses can set off auto immune diseases. My mom got rheumatoid arthritis after having severe spanish flu when she was 29, and multiple rheumatologists have told her that could have set it off. She now has secondary sjogrens. I on the other hand have had primary sjogrens since I was very young--I was actually diagnosed at age 11 which was the youngest they had ever seen."

"Sjogren's can be secondary--that is, it isn't your primary cause of symptoms. Its hallmark symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth. When I say dry eyes and dry mouth, I mean DRY. I have 16 crowns in my mouth because of the long term damage from having little saliva. My eyes are another story completely!"

"I'm realizing that my post didn't really answer your question--I just wanted to explain to you what Sjogrens is like from someone who actually has it, instead of an online article you might find somewhere. Please feel free to PM me, and if you could explain more of your symptoms for us that would help too."
"I'm super new at this too, but after talking to my somewhat useless rheum, my PCP gave me some good advice: meditation, nutritionally dense foods and exercise. Obviously this is in tandem with whatever pills and regimen you have with your doc, but I find that the mediation is especially helpful, and also turmeric 3x a day. There are a couple sjogren's facebook groups that are super active, I just joined those, that is fun. I HIGHLY recommend the meditation though. For me, it made a HUGE difference in the fatigue, I think it's because my pain would ease, I would be more relaxed and then sleep deeper, I would start my day better rested, etc."

"Is your skin rash SCLE? That's what mine was. Again, advice from a friend: I bumped up my beta carotene BIGTIME - sweet potatoes, carrots like they are going out of style. My rash is all but gone. Hope you find more answers, poke around. Dry.org and the Sjogren's foundation have very robust websites with lots of useful articles."

EDIT: I am also gluten free. HUGE difference. Like the difference between living a normal life or going to bed every day at 2pm.
Thank you so much for your help!
"I've had mono before, but honestly, I didn't notice feeling more tired than normal during that time. I've had debilitating fatigue from the time I was pretty young. I would physically get violent when my mom tried to wake me up for school. Now, I sleep at least 9 or 10 hours a night, sometimes upwards of 18. I get tired on and off throughout the day and frequently take naps (between 2 and 6 hours). For the past 4 months, I've had an itchy rash on my calves and on my cheeks that was initially believed to be a fungal infection, but didn't respond to 2 weeks with an antifungal cream followed by 3 weeks of an oral antifungal pill. I've been alternating between cortisone cream and benedryl allergy cream, but it never stays gone for long. I've recently begun breaking out in hives on my upper legs and face as well, with no clear indication of a cause. I went to the ER once for a spike (125/70) in my usually abnormal low blood pressure (80/50), along with visible shakes, dizziness, trouble swallowing, and tingly hands and feet. I barely get out of bed until around 5pm now. I've had swollen, painful lymph nodes under my jaw and under my left cheekbone. Yesterday, I started having swelling in my throat and began having wheezy coughs and trouble breathing, which resolved mostly after chugging Benadryl. My doctor thinks I'm nuts, but I just want to have energy!"
"Have you ever had really weird memory problems? I've noticed that I'll forget what day it is or not remember what I did the day before or before a nap. I've started losing things and then finding them really weird places that I would never put them. I only put my purse in my room or hanging on the edge of the kitchen chair and after a lot of frantic searching, I found it hanging on my bike seat inside my garage. I'm super protective of my glasses, so I never put them anywhere they'll scratch and either leave them on the bedside table or the dresser and after searching everywhere, I found them in the bottom of my purse, not in a case or anything, with a backpack sitting on top of it. In both situations, I don't ever remember putting them there. I feel like I'm losing bits of my memory. Do anybody you have any suggestions?"
"I definitely cant say that sounds like sjogrens, but I did have something similar--I broke out in hives for three months when I was 22 and there was literally no cause from it--they ended up deciding it was stress. have you looked into chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep apnea, anything like that?"
"Now that you mention it - I do think my memory fails me more during flares. During my last flare I had problems - fishing for words, losing items, misplacing things. Not sure if it's a function of neurological impairment (""brain fog"") or maybe not sleeping well. Have you started a regimen yet? You should start to improve once you start eating right, meditating and then getting a good night's sleep."
"My doctor believes that I have sleep apnea, but it seems to come and go, so we're assuming it's central sleep apnea (the neurological kind). I'm supposed to get an allergy test and then a sleep study, but I'm really broke right now. I don't know if it's my webmd addiction and frustration at no real diagnosis, but I'm worried that it's some form of cancer or lupus."
"well, ignoring the cancer part, lupus is another auto immune disease in the same family as RA and sjogrens. There are...quite a few of them! And as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing wrong with web md-ing your symptoms, because often times doctors do not give satisfactory answers."

"Regarding sleep apnea--I would not be surprised if that is part of it. If fatigue is your biggest issue, I wouldn't point to sjogrens as the number one cause. Fatigue is a symptom of many auto immune diseases, not just sjogrens."

"I feel the need to point out that I am not a doctor, by the way--just someone who has gone through all of this before."

edit: 1: are you a female? this is much more common in women. 2: booze me up scotty. love it.
"Yeah, I'm a 23 year old female haha. And thanks! Because of financial reasons, I'm basically at the point where I'm googling things and coming up with suggestions before going to the doctor to cut down on the number of appointments. I know you're not a doctor (DISCLAIMER AWARENESS) but do you have any suggestions of tests I should request based on my symptoms?"
"pretty much the only two tests they did for me were the blood test for antibodies + a spit test. They had me spit as much as I could into a vial for like 5 minutes..sounds funny, but I wasn't able to spit at all. From what I have experienced, the diagnosis has a lot to do with your symptoms. I just don't know if the fatigue being your number 1 symptom really points to sjogrens. For me, when I DO get tired, my Sjogrens flares up, as opposed to sjogrens CAUSING me to be tired. Does that make sense?"
"Yeah, it does. My doctor called me today to officially go over lab results and blew off both the fact that my labs showed a huge presence of antibodies for Epstein Barr and also the Shogren's. She asked me if my eyes were dry and I said I wasn't sure, so she said I must not have it. I brought up the fact that my reason to come in last was swollen, painful lymph nodes in my jaw and cheek and that the description of Shogren's said that was important and to bring it up with a doctor, she said ""Everyone has lymph nodes. I have lymph nodes. I already said your lab work came back normal."" When I asked what my next step should be (seeing a rheumatologist to look more into the EBV and other potential autoimmune causes of my fatigue), she said that I should ""start talking to a counselor about (my) constant need to feel sick."" She repeatedly said that I should talk to someone about my ""depression"" and that there was no physical cause. I am absolutely livid. I hung up the phone and bawled for like 30 minutes. Yes, I do/have had depression and anxiety, but it's made WORSE by this fatigue. I know that ""depression fatigue"" feels like more of a not wanting to get out of bed feeling, versus wanting to go out and do things, but getting exhausted just from getting up and showering. I love my job and I want to be there, but I've started nodding off on the way there and when sitting for too long, as well as needing multiple days to recuperate from intense shifts. This is NOT depression fatigue. I don't even know what the next step should be. Is this a typical response from a doctor? I'm so worried that no one will take me seriously."
"No, it sounds like your doctor sucks. Depression fatigue is more of a mental fatigue--disinterest, no motivation. Physical fatigue is like what you say--you literally want to just sleep. Your next step is to disregard your doctor and book an appointment with a top rheumatologist in your area. Search top doctors list 2014 in ____ (your city) on google and they usually have lists that pop up and you can filter by specialty. Get all of your lab work sent to your new doctor before your appointment. Let us know how it goes!!!"
"holy shit, your doctor is an asshole."

"Edit: I'm sorry, that was totally immature. I will compose a real response shortly."
"Support forums are good, in-person groups are better. Remember that a lot of the medical edifice(or artifice) is not set up to actually address long-term conditions; you have things going south on you in flares, in fits and starts, according to whatever's going on in your life. I strongly recommend getting a Rheum who is a great fit for you, and who has time to coordinate a strategy for proceeding. There are drugs and other options for each of your conditions, but it's irresponsible to make a medical choice based on one thing without looking at the big picture."

"Getting stress under control, finding a diet and activity pattern that work for you, avoiding your triggers, this should be your top priority. Outside of finding a great doctor the support groups are great because you have people with years of experience dealing with what is new for you, dig?"

"I know Plaquenil is a good choice for most Sjs patients, and there are infusables for SLE(like Benlysta) and injection treatments for Raynaud's, most people I see in the office with similar combinations of AI conditions use steroids to manage flares, avoid sunlight, take Vitamin D, and minimize stress. What I don't know is which of your conditions would be aggravated by treating the others. Read all the warnings and look at the *most common* side effects first."

"My starting advice is this: Change your internal monologue first; say ""I got this"" to yourself. Give yourself permission to go a little slower and rest in between tasks; you may find that makes the difference between doing stuff at all or not. Find your limits, and live in a way that can test them, in case you can do better, but not so much that you are constantly breaking down from doing too much."

"No one ever says ""I wish I had put in more overtime"" on their deathbed."
SS is a risk factor for Celiac and we have a much higher rate of having Celiac.

http://www.celiaccentral.org/newlydiagnosed/Related-Conditions/Sjogren-s-Disease/44/
"Thank you for replying. There is a group in my area and they actually meet really close to my house! I will get back into exercise (I've had a chest cold for like, a month) and I will be experimenting with my diet, trying to find additional triggers. I meditate. I want to be proactive and address the disease. I'm not against medicine, but I was surprised he immediately put me on the blood pressure medication. I'm not sure if that is a good idea long term. He also seemed to dismiss looking for dietary triggers. I have an appointment with my GP on Friday, she's an MD but is very holistic in her approach, will be interested to see what she says about all of this."

"I always thought I was just a ""low energy"" person."
"Thank you for posting this. :-/ I'm glad I'm already gf. What's weird is that I never had any bowel issues like people with celiac do - it's almost as if the wheat makes my SS flare, weird eh? Do you have celiac also?"
"For medication, I found that Evoxac got along really well with my body, but it is crazy expensive. It did make my sicca symptoms MUCH more comfortable, in my case Sjogren's is strongly suspected by my previous rheumatologist but then I moved & aged out of insurance before being able to finalize that diagnosis."

"For my Raynaud's, the Procardia had too many side effects for me to continue, but I have a ton of comorbidities so your mileage may vary."

"At any rate, it sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders and will continue to benefit from the management choices you've made & are still making as you adapt to each new diagnosis."
"I haven't been formally diagnosed, but yes I believe I have Celiac."
"& this may be TMI, but the JO brand of massage oil/lube works super well without getting sticky if down below gets dried out during intercourse."
I have heard Evoxac is only expensive in America...
Surprisingly I am not having a problem with that... yet. Thank  you for all the recs! I appreciate you sharing your experience with me.
This is litchick's complete lack of surprise.
"I do, and I love it. My teeth feel dentist clean all the time now! And I think it helps a little with dry mouth/bad taste in my mouth. After you do it a few times, the feeling of the oil in your mouth isn't as gross. I start right before my shower and spit it out at the end of my morning routine, so I can get close to 20 minutes without having to just sit there for 20 minutes feeling like a weirdo :)"
I haven't been able to get over the weirdness stage.
"I noticed my teeth felt cleaner during the day today and my mouth definitely wasn't as dry as it usually is, but that's only an n of 1, so... yeah.  I'll try to go a little longer tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback! I swished while I was cleaning up this morning. I can't imagine just swishing for 20 minutes and nothing else :)"
"To me, the weirdest part is waiting for it to melt in my mouth. Once it's liquid, the swishing isn't bad, sorta like when I use the Biotene PBR rinse. But yeah.. it's kinda weird."
My doc gave me a whole starter pack of biotene products. I can't say that I was really impressed with any of them!
"I use the rinse and the toothpaste. I've found that regular rinses and toothpastes are too strong/minty and end up irritating my mouth. I haven't tried any others specifically for dry mouth, though."

Take aggressively good care of your teeth. Find a dentist that specializes in SS and be careful with sugar. Dental loss is a pretty big problem with SS.
"Hi! Sjogren's dse has a triad of symptoms, so you might expect this things:"
"Xeropthalmia -- 'Dry Eyes',"
Xerostomia -- 'Dry mouth' and
"Dyspareunia -- Pain on sexual intercourse, Specifically for female who would experience, on Sjogren's Triad, is the Vaginal dryness."

"Your rheumatic conditions are all obviously connected to each other, so always stick with your rheumatologists advice. If your doctor had already discussed, these are all Idiopathic in nature so, it may take your lifetime in dealing this condition and in trying to address the dse. All you can do is to minimize the effect of all the symptoms."

"Manifestations on you, cannot be really be addressed individually per problem cause this is a systemic disorder, so, the specialists on the eye, or an ortho for the knee, could only do as much. like what I have said, stick with your Rheumatologist, and wtv medication is given, go on with it. I wish u the best and may God take care of your health. :)"
I think it depends on the person. The only significant symptoms that I've experienced are dry eyes and maybe some joint pain every now and then. It seems to be a pretty manageable autoimmune disease when compared to things like RA and Lupus.
"Thanks for the information, I am being referred to a new Rhuematologist and have an eye Doctor that works with all kinds of eye diseases."
"Thanks so much for responding, I am still in shock with finding I have something else to deal with."

Welcome! professor_snark gave you some great info. I was very symptomatic when I was diagnosed so I can't give you any information from that side. I'd suggest paying careful attention to your teeth. It isn't uncommon for people with SS to have significant tooth loss early. Some people even choose to have them all pulled and just have dentures.
"Thank you for your detailed response. I had swollen lacrimal glands that had prolapsed forward.  When the surgeon repaired them he took a biopsy that showed a polyclonal b cell infiltrate.  It was at that point they ordered ssa and ssb titers, of which I only tested positive for the latter."

"Dry mouth and dry eyes are such relative symptoms that I thought well maybe I do have these symptoms and have just ignored it. However,  reading up on how much people suffer from these and the extent to which they interfere with day to day activities,  I can conclude that I don't have these."

The rheum doc said meds at this point would be not worth the trouble. I guess I am just worried about the lymphoma predilection and if I have just been lucky up until this point!

Thanks again for your thoughtful response.

Stay on top of them. If possible find a dentist who has experience with Sjogren's and can give you the best care.
"When I was pregnant I got very, very sick and my body has never really been right since. I think it probably started with the general dryness then. Then there was a long family crisis and my body just couldn't handle it anymore and I became super sick."
Ebstein barr virus has been associated with sjogrens.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1865260/


"I got food poisoning, and then when I went to the doctor they found antibodies of epstein-barr.  About a month after that, my symptoms began in full force!"
Mine started at the same time as a cancer diagnosis.
"A friend of a friend of mine had the same experience during her pregnancy. I've never met her though, so I don't know any detail about her situation other than she was eventually diagnosed with SS."

That is really interesting.
"I had preeclampsia too! I was so horribly sick and in the end they had to take my kiddo early. I did nurse for 11 months, but it's difficult to tell because that was a pretty bad time overall in life."

"My aunt is a nurse and she told me at the time that I would get high blood pressure from it eventually, but that there hasn't been a lot of research on the long term affects of preeclampsia or eclampsia. I looked into it a few years ago and most doctors consider it resolved once the blood pressure returns to normal after birth and i couldn't find much else. It would be very interesting to see if there is at least a correlation."
"Sorry you have been sick. Must be something in the air. I have been also. Finally got my abdominal cat scan done yesterday to check for lymphoma. Oral and iv contrast. Today I am exhausted. Soft hugs, light and blessings to you."
[Here](http://chroniccurve.tumblr.com/post/18899384182/15-tips-for-seeing-a-new-rheumatologist-your-first) is a good article with some tips to start you off.

"1. Oh there are so many things. It's hare to get it organized. Write out your health history, take any medications you take with you, write down any supplements you take, try to remember the onset of the symptoms. You will likely be asked the health history of your immediate family so you may want to write that out."

2. That seems to depend on the dr. You may need a biopsy. [Here](http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/sjogrens_syndrome/#diagnosed) is some helpful info.

3. Expect a very thorough exam. You will be poked and prodded about everywhere.  You will probably get a lot of information in a short amount of time. Bring something to write notes on. Also try to snag his nurse's card so you have someone to call directly when you have a follow-up question on need some help.

"That's all I've got for the moment, but it's been a very foggy day."

"Regarding tests, if you already had blood work done, they might have you try to spit onto a vial or something like that to measure your saliva output but the bloodwork is the Main part."

Your symptoms seem to be classic--I have all of those as well. Do you have dental decay from dry mouth? Are your eyes usually very dry?

"The problem with AI diseases is that their symptoms all closely Match each other. Joint pain, fatigue, GI tract issues, repeated illness and weakened immune system. Your doctor will most likely just ask you a lot of questions. Hope this helps!"


Feel free to PM me if you want--I am a 23 YO female who was diagnosed with Sjögren's at age 11. I've been through it all!
Thanks! That sounds quite overwhelming! I hope that I am comfortable with the doctor and he listens. Some people on the Facebook group commented on the lip biopsy and most in a very negative way. I think I might opt out of having it done if he suggests it.
There's a good group on FB too. I think the link is in the sidebar. I've learned a lot there too. Best of luck at your appt!
"I just got home from my appt. They are re-doing my blood work because my primary doctor didn't run the ANA right the first time (no numbers, just positive/negative). They're rerunning everything else too but they said that once the SSA is positive it  remains positive. They did the eye test on me for tears and oh god, ugh. My left eye is making no tears at all and my right eyes is barely making any. My dry mouth didn't start till January so my teeth are alright. My dental hygienist said that I have more plaque build-up than usual though so I'm going to get more frequent cleanings. Oh yeah and they are also testing me for Celiac disease. The doctor was a bit awkward but his nurse practitioner seemed pretty nice and understanding and took most of my info and answered my questions."

Thanks for the support! I may PM you at some point I'm sure so thank you very much for the offer :) This is all quite overwhelming and it'd be good to have support.
Good luck!
I hope you don't have to wait too long for the test results.
My follow up isn't for a month! :( They said I could call and they'd give me the test results over the phone but would not discuss diagnosis until I come in.
Awe that sucks. :/
Thanks. I think I'll call over on Monday and see if I can get any bit of info.
This came through my facebook feed today and seem appropriate here- http://imgur.com/mYxlw0c
Aside from the general if you ate better/exercised more/weighed less thing I'd be miraculously cured I've had this fun one. I was complaining about getting dehydrated and a friend suggested I should try magnets.
I knew this would somehow come up.  Ha ha ha.

"Baking soda.  Not sure if I was supposed to eat it, or mix it with something.  But, from what this lady told me, it's literally a miracle product.  It cures cancer, you know?"

Yeah....I unfriended that kook the same afternoon.
"I haven't been fully diagnosed yet but when I was having all the symptoms my mom said that I keep my AC too low in my house so she's sure that's why my eyes were dry. Then when I told her about all the blood work being positive she said it could just be a false positive. She likes to downplay things a lot. <sigh> not exactly advice to ""cure"" things but along the same lines..."
"It's a good topic, but yes I picked it because of her. You're apparently supposed to make tea out of it. And hey ""It can't hurt!""."
"I'm personally so happy to see this! I subscribed a couple months ago and never saw any action...and being so lucky as to have sjogren's, fibro and a full time job, I usually am not a good conversation starter. But yay! People who get me! And I agree NicholaiBlack, I think it will be great too!"
Doubled again!!! Yeah!
"Add me to the list. I'm new, just got here and I posted an introductory post. I have to tell you I was so happy to see this subreddit when I searched for Sjogren's on Reddit."
"Welcome, Sadie.  ""Lucky""?  Yeah, right."
"Welcome Sadie! I was lucky like that once. Then with 3 neck surgeries, two more auto immune diseases and now bronchiectasis,I had togive up the job. Good luck on keeping it and staying mobile. Light and blessings."
Wow.  That's impressive.
"Yes...I was hoping my dripping with sarcasm comment came across ;) I am only lucky to have great supports in my life, minus great doctors. There's a day for everything right?"
"If we could get that ""great doctors"" part squared away that'd be great."
"I had ""health issues"" for 5 years before being officially diagnosed with Sjogrens and Fibromyalgia. I was so relieved to get an answer as to what, but still wanting to know why an otherwise healthy 32 year old suddenly starts to fall apart. Not sure I will ever know."
"Almost 2 years in, no diagnosis. Sjogrens is the main suspect. Pos ANA, dry eyes, light sensitivity, joint pain, neuropathy. Went through a really bad patch where I couldn't get out of bed some days or sleep through the night due to pain. I seem to be in some sort of phase where I don't have as much joint pain, except for certain times of the month. Dry eyes never stop. Dry skin mostly under control."
It took around 5 years to get my diagnosis.
"I'm not entirely sure.  I got very, very sick when I was pregnant with my son and I think I may have started having mild symptoms then.  Several years later I had a ridiculous work/college load and a ton of family stuff that ended with my grandpa's passing and it just kind of broke my health.  From that time until a diagnosis was about a year. So either one year or eleven.  I'm really not sure."
I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at 30.  After surgeries due to a bad injury.  That was 95.  I didn't get diagnosed with Sjogren's until 2007.  And I have had no treatment for it outside of eye drops.  Tomorrow my rheumy and I get to have a discussion on treatment options.
"I was just diagnosed last September, after being hospitalized nearly two dozen times in the previous two years.  My allergist found it by accident. Started having symptoms as if I was having an allergic reaction to a food, but all of my allergy tests came back negative. They happened to do an autoimmune panel with some other blood work. This was after nearly a half million in doctors bills, three spinal surgeries, and hundreds of tests.  My doctors still don't think that SS explains my symptoms, but everyday I read something new that makes me think otherwise."
How are you feeling about the appointment?
"Wow, what food were you reacting to?"

"I'm getting nervous. I am so needing treatment to try and get this in remission. I'm worried he'll blow me off. Oh well, time to turn it over. I'll let you know how it went."
They thought I might have a gluten allergy.
I hope it goes well!
Really? Interesting. I can't eat gluten although I hadn't associated it with SS.
The appointment went well.  The doctor listened to my issues and we worked on solutions.  Do I like the solutions?  No. We changed my thyroid medicine to natural thyroid.  This is for my Hashimoto's.  Quite happy with this.
He started me on plaquenil for the Sjogren's.  Don't know if it will help any but it is a start.
"Also did blood work to see if I have CVID.  If I do, I will have to go to an immunologist to see about treating that.  This would account for the recurring pneumonia and other illnesses.  My immune system is shot for now."
I was working two days a week in a non profit coffee bar.  I had to stop because being around people is just asking for being sick.  So my life has been shrunk again.  We are working towards a better life but I seem to be going backwards right now.
"I was having the symptoms of a gluten intolerance, but I tested negative for all foods. May not necessarily be the SS."
"I'm happy that the doc listened and is trying to help.  Plaquenil can lessen some of the symptoms but can take up to a year to work.  Did he/she tell you about having your eyes checked while on it?  I had to see the eye doc before I started it and then once a year while on it.  It has a rare side effect of eye damage.  I don't remember the specifics, I'm sure you can google it or ask your pharmacist."

"Frequent hand washing and not touching my face have been my best defense against catching things that come home with the family.  For most of us that end up like this, it isn't how we planned for our lives to go.  It's frustrating when you can't do the things you want to.  Hopefully the docs will find medications that will help you get back on track, but until then, hang in there."




Yeah! for it going mostly well.
Thank you. No he didn't easy anything about my eyes. Should I talk to him or an eye Dr?
Thank you for all the support and well wishes. It's nice not to be alone in this. I hope everyone is having a pain free weekend
"Yes, I had to get a red dot test that tested my field of vision. I understand that's pretty normal with plaquenil.  And Kaylinofhr is right it can take it awhile to work, but it does work more quickly for some people and hopefully it will be quicker for you."
"You can ask him about it next time you see him.  It was explained to me that it's a rare side effect and with regular eye exams, the eye doc can see if it's starting before I would notice any visual changes."
Would recommend ultrasound of Salvitory glands.  Early Sjo test took 3 weeks for me. Positive.     Lip biopsy HAS to be done by a lab that’s used to dealing with Sjögrens.
How severe are your symptoms?

On planiquel for about 3 months now.  Very slow acting drug. But Seems to be helping a lot at this point.
I got my blood tests back really fast I think. I had positive ANAs and they still wanted to do a lip biopsy to be sure 🤷‍♀️

My doctors wouldn't start me on anything or confirm a diagnosis until they had a positive lip biopsy.
"Hi there, sorry for my delayed reply."

"After a long delay I called Quest labs. It turns out that they sub-contract a non-Quest lab for these 'early screening' Sjogren's tests. That lab has told Quest that they are delayed (didn't explain why) and will get caught up in the next week or two. Quest promises test results in 30 days, but that's clearly not accurate. More like 5 or 6 wks this time around."

"Regarding salivary glands, I happened to go an oral pathologist last week because of an ulcer in my mouth. The ulcer turned out to be harmless. She gave me a full physical exam and told me that my parotid glands (the upper salivary glands) had atrophied."

My rheum told me I'll need a biopsy if I test positive for Sjogren's. I'm assuming he meant the lip biopsy.

"My main symptoms are dry eye, dry mouth, vaginal dryness (started in my early 40s way before menopause), and severe light sensitivity (have to wear sunglasses almost everywhere). I'm also getting more and more fatigued."

"My rheum suggested I start Plaquenil, but I want to hold off until we get my test results. I'm already on about a dozen medications for other illnesses (e.g., mast cell disease, PTSD/anxiety, GERD), so I'm resistant to adding another med to my roster if we're not sure yet that I have Sjogren's. I tested negative for lupus."

"What side effects do you experience from Plaquenil? That's another concern of mine, the side effects."
Thanks for sharing that info! Sorry for my delayed reply.

On it for 3 months. Mostly I've noticed a reduction in needing adderral to overcome extreme fatigue.  This is a reversal of I was slowly needing more and more of it before the Planquenil.
Used to take 40mg a day.  I take around 15mg a day now.

"Can sometimes cause me to sweat more.  But since I have mostly lost the ability to sweat, I find this a plus."

Sometimes sleep isn't great if I take it at bedtime.
Anyone who has an autoimmune disorder should be tested to see if they have antiphospholipid syndrome (blood clotting disorder)  before going on oral contraceptives. Autoimmune disorder increases chances of having antiphospholipid syndrome.

Thant is very interesting i did not know that. Thank you
"I got the nexplanon implant before my formal diagnosis and had it replaced at the 3 year mark (as is normal). I've had no problems, but every woman is different. For me it stopped my period completely other than a bit of cramping around that time, which is a nice bonus."

"I would definitely talk to your doctors about the statistics for complications, clotting, etc. with any birth control."
I've had the Mirena IUD for a little less then 3 years and I've really liked it and haven't had too many side effects. My period would cause horrible cramping and  horrible flare ups of my Sjogren's symptoms and joint pain so with the hormonal IUD I don't even really have a period and so I don't have that problem anymore. So a big game changer for me.

But every person is different and what works for me might not work for you. I was on the pill for a couple years before the IUD and I didn't really have any issues except when I did have my period. I unfortunately don't remember what brands I was on.
"Yes-- very much agree about the testing. I clotted (DVT/PE) on the pill many years ago, because I didn't know about testing."

"If you have APS, avoid birth control with estrogen. This is a good one to talk over with you gyn, who will likely have a lot more information about birth control options and will help you find one that's right for you."
"I've been battling various chronic illnesses for 10 years. In my mid thirties now. I started my own company 7 years ago, feeling very ill physically. Fatigued, lungs burning, chronic back pain from my degenerative disc disease. At that time nobody knew what was wrong with my lungs and the fatigue, so I did not have any medication."

"While illnesses certainly affect productivity it's not about how much you can do in a small amount of time, it's about being persistent. You do your best, one day at a time. You keep grinding."

"You can succeed, you can be an entrepreneur. As long as you can find a routine that works for you. And being an entrepreneur is excellent for that, for the ability to be flexible. It's going to be stressful too, especially in the beginning, but taking it one day at a time, doing your best and being persistent there is no reason why you couldn't do what you want to do. Also, don't be afraid to fail, it's the key to success =)"
"You could have any number of different conditions, so yes, getting tested is key. Widespread tendon issues, or possibly enthesitis, could be caused by some autoimmune disorders other than Sjögrens. These may also cause dry eye as well."
Thanks for your words of encouragement. It helps to see others who have made the best of their circumstances.
"Oh, I didn't know there are disorders that can cause tendon issues and dry eye. But yes, I think I just have to be patient until I know for sure what (if any) disorder I have, although it isn't easy to wait. I did do a DNA test a few years ago, and I have several DNA variations (SNPs)  that make me more at risk for getting Sjogren's than the average person. Of course this does not mean I have it, it just makes it a bit more likely."
"I don't have any problems with styes or anything and have Sjögren's. I didn't even realize anything was wrong until a new rheumatologist said she could just ""see it"" when she looked at me. Had a lip biopsy and was diagnosed about 2 years ago."

"She didn't want to officially diagnose me until we had the lip biopsy, so that's what I recommend people do if they think they have it - see a rheumy and get one. Then you won't have the issue of doctors not believing you, which is something I encounter a lot for some reason."
Get the Sjo test.
"It’s funny you mention the eye swelling. Years before my diagnosis, I would wake up to an entirely swollen eyelid. It made no sense, since I had no allergies and didn’t do anything to trigger it. This may have been an early symptom to my development of sjorens. As far as ANA and SSA antibodies, the diagnosis is not dependent on them being positive. I don’t have any antibodies yet I have very severe clinical manifestations and was diagnosed upon my first visit."
"Your symptoms sound a lot like mine. Parotid swelling, dry eyes, icky lungs, and fatigue...the fatigue has been the most debilitating part. I’m going through the process of being diagnosed with asthma as well (I’m sure I have it) but I really think it’s due to Sjogren’s. SS causes lung problems for a lot of people. I have constant burning when I breathe, and a dry cough. It started right around the same time as my eyes. My first dry eye symptoms were eye infections, and then shortly after that my eyes got dry enough that I couldn’t put my contacts in. I wash my bottom and top eyelashes twice a day with a mild cleanser, and have (knock on wood) not had an eye infection in a few years."

"I was diagnosed with the early sjogren’s panel and symptoms, as my rheumatologist doesn’t agree with doing lip biopsies. I asked him if I could do a parotid ultrasound, but he told me it wasn’t necessary. I’ve had off and on parotid swelling for years...it was especially bad in my late teens (I’m 38) and I’m curious if I have scar tissue etc in my parotid. I am not taking any immunosuppressants, but am getting a third opinion next year, I need a break from doctor’s for a few months, to make sure I don’t need one. I’ve had quite an improvement in my saliva by following a low carb diet and taking white peony. Dry mouth used to be my most annoying problem, and it has not been an issue the last year. It seems my lungs and the fatigue are my biggest battles right now."
Are you taking any medications?
"Thanks for the input, appreciate it! =)"
Hi!

Do you mean this panel test?

[https://acrabstracts.org/abstract/sjo-an-advanced-diagnostic-panel-for-detection-of-sjogrens-syndrome-autoantibodies/](https://acrabstracts.org/abstract/sjo-an-advanced-diagnostic-panel-for-detection-of-sjogrens-syndrome-autoantibodies/)
Hi!

Did you have swollen eyelids many times? In both eyes?

May I ask what your clinical manifestations are?
Hi!

A burn in my lungs is exactly what I feel. And I have always felt a correlation between the sensation of burn and fatigue. At least to some extent. Have you noticed a correlation? If the burn sensation is more clear and intense that you would also be more tired that day?

"Earlier, when I had parotid swelling, I felt there was a correlation between the burn and the swelling too."

Do you exercise? If I exercise and spend a lot of time outdoors my lung symptoms worsen for the next day or even day after that.  It's like it triggers an inflammation response. I would say cold weather and breathing cold air is poison too.
Hi!

Yes. I'm on doxycycline antibiotic:

[https://www.drugs.com/international/doximycin.html](https://www.drugs.com/international/doximycin.html)

And I'm using an Innovair Inhaler for my lungs twice a day:

[https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html](https://www.drugs.com/international/innovair.html)

[https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler](https://www.tabletwise.com/indonesia/innovair-inhaler)

Actually started using Innovair 2-3 months before my eyes got like this. Before that I was using Budesonid Easyhaler for a long time:

[https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/242/smpc](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/242/smpc)
yes
"Maybe there is a correlation between the lung burning and the fatigue...I’ll have to track it more closely. I’ve had the burning most of the summer, with a week-long reprieve last month and I guess I was more energetic for that time."

"Being outside definitely triggers it. My little break from it being so bad, was after spending two weeks indoors...no going for walks, no playing with my kids outside, just straight from house-car-indoor destination. As soon as my lungs felt better, I went back to going outside a little bit...and now I’m back to my lungs being bad. What a blah life haha! I used to walk for an hour outside every night, but I’ve stopped doing that and do a mild workout inside on days I have it in me. I’m not sure if indoor exercise triggers it, or if it’s just an outdoor/pollen thing."
"Innovair can contribute to mouth dryness, but it wouldn't explain your eye issues. I would say, get the lip biopsy to be sure! It's really not painful, and it'll give you more info. That said, even if you do have SS, doctors don't tend to treat it any differently than simple sicca syndrome, unless it is affecting other organs =/ Good luck to you!"
"Do you use an inhaler? It has made a huge difference for me, improving things and calming down that burn. However, I feel it's a constant battle between the inflammation and the inhaler. So keeping things healthy otherwise in life too helps. Unfortunately more straining exercise and being outside in cold or pollen rich air exacerbates symptoms."

"You should definitely try an inhaler, and give it a week with inhaling morning and night before you go to sleep. Be sure to aim for an inhaler with ingredients of small particle size, as this will help the medication reach also small air ways in your lungs. This makes a big difference for me."

"Also, an inhaler with a combination of steroid and ""air way opening"" medication has been the best for me so far. I use this one currently:"

[https://www.chiesi.fr/en/innovair-1006-%C2%B5gdose](https://www.chiesi.fr/en/innovair-1006-%C2%B5gdose)

"You should look into this ASAP, as you do not want to have chronic inflammation in your lungs untreated. I've read it can lead to all kinds of bad things in the long run, lungs taking damage from being so inflamed all the time."
"Thanks so much! That’s great to know, so I can make sure to get the right inhaler. I have a breathing test in a couple weeks. The pulmonologist told me to do a nebulizer with saline a few times a day, and to take NAC. He gave me 6 weeks to do that, to see if it would help before doing the breathing test. It’s kind of helped 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t have time to do the nebulizer 3 x/day, so it doesn’t always get done. I feel the moisture going in, but still have the burning. He also had me get an inexpensive PEP device. I think I’ll need the inhaler to calm things down though...I wish he had just given me one, but I guess understand him wanting to try other things."
"I would not trust the breathing test. What they do is test your breathing before taking the bronchodilator, and then after. I mean it's good to take but it does not tell the whole story. For me the bronchodilator has a clear effect when the burning and the inflammation is really bad. But before I started on any corticosteroid I could also take the test and do well in it. If I had trusted that solely I would still be in really bad shape."

"Oh! And my pep score was always good. A doctor mentioned I have Asthma affecting small airways, not really the large airways. For this reason the pep score and breathing test could be pretty much ok, but I'd still feel really bad and sometimes like I'm not getting enough oxygen."

"There should be absolutely no harm in testing the corticosteroid inhaler for two weeks and see if something changes. And getting both a bronchodilator inhaler and a corticosteroid inhaler would be best, or an inhaler which has both effect in the same package."

"I'm just telling you this because the case was so clear for me. Only when I tried a corticosteroid inhaler could I start feeling the difference. Sure, the bronchodilator made me breath better but that burn went nowhere and I still felt really fatigued."

"And give it two weeks of regular use, if it works then there's something there =) Where I'm from doctors have to prescribe those corticosteroid inhalers, while bronchodilators can be received without prescriptions."

It's made a very big difference in my life and I hope you get to test it too and it has the same effect.
"I won’t see my lung doctor until next week, but my lungs were getting worse and worse because I caught a cold. My primary doctor gave me a combination inhaler. I used one puff the first day, which was fine, and then yesterday tried two puffs...that was a mistake! I was WIRED for like 4 hours. I also don’t know if it’s the small particle size one...it looks like maybe it’s not :( It seems to have helped calm things down a little anyways and I’m breathing easier. I noticed that it makes my throat a little drier. My eyes are also drier than normal today, but that could easily be from not getting enough sleep last night."
Which inhaler did he prescribe?

"I got a restless chest with Innovair in the beginning, but it subsided with time using it. If one puff does not give you anything you could try one in the morning and one in the evening, perhaps 3-4 hours before you go to sleep just to be sure :)"

Consistency is key to notice the difference.

"Oh, and remember to gargle and flush your mouth with water every time after taking a puff."
"I received my letter in less than a month after the biopsy, but honestly the return time is likely down to things like department workload etc, the kinds of things that slow down any workplace."

"As for the white patch, I didn't notice anything like that on my lip, but I used salt water so it may be something to do with the mouth wash... I know that's not helpful but I don't want to push anecdotal experience as fact. Keep an eye on it, if it's still of concern in a few days a quick call to your GP may put your mind at rest."
Depends where you are! Here in Europe I got the results in 2 weeks! The doctor actually had the results a bit sooner but he wanted to go over face to face the results and any questions I had.

"As for the white patch, that is normal. I had that too after the stitches healed up. I probably felt a bump (which was scar tissue) for a good month or two after the stitches. Now, almost a year later, it’s like it was never there. So don’t worry, it goes away!"
"Ah! I am in Europe as well, and I got mine done last week, so I figure it's a bit too soon to get the results. Was your biopsy positive? And, do the stitches dissolve or does the thread fall out? My thread is coming undone. Thank you for the informations :)"
"Yeah! My biopsy came back positive. My stitches dissolved and one of them fell out, just how my dr said they would! I think as long as it doesn’t hurt, your good! But nothing wrong with calling it in and asking! I remember for the longest time, I thought it wasn’t healing and it “felt” open and exposed, but here I am months later and my mouth feels like I didn’t even have it done!"

Feel free to ask anything else! Good luck!
"Thank you :) I kind of hope mine will come back positive as well, as it would explain the plethora of symptoms I've been experiencing for the past two years! Do you remember how long it took for the stitches to dissolve completely?"
"Yeah, it took my doctors about 4 months to discover what was wrong with me. I kept getting sent to diff specialists. I got a blood tests done and it came back negative, but the lip biopsy was the last shot they took as they didn’t know what was wrong. And lo and behold it was sjogrens. Before I got the results, I figured it was sjogrens since I had 90 percent of the symptoms and saw that a lot of people would get false negatives from blood analysis."

"As for the stitches, I actually don’t remember! I remember it bothered me a lot, and prob by the third week I was just used to it! The. Instead of stitches being there, I had scar tissue. Sorry! I wanna say 3 weeks? It heals for sure!"
"Interesting! I have a positive ANA, but the titer is only 1:80, my blood test results came back negative for anti SSA/SSB. My doctors decided to do the biopsy because my organs are getting affected, so in that case the treatment will be much different than for local manifestations of the disease."

"Three weeks seem like a reasonable amount of time, two more weeks to go then! :)"

"Do you know if it is normal for the dryness to be more intense at times? Like, the past 4 months I had to put eye drops about 50-60 times a day, and it's been two weeks I only need to use eye drops 15-20 times a day."
The doctors should also know/ give you a time
Frame for when results should come in if ever!

"Yeah, dryness can be more intense at times of flaring (more fatigue, aches, more dry etc). For me, I’d put eye drops all the time since my dryness was really bad. But I’m one of the few cases where my sjogrens isn’t as bad as when it started. When my symptoms started, I had really dry mouth and dry eyes. Now, my eyes aren’t as dry, but I still use eye drops maybe 4 times a day as opposed to the 60 times. And I don’t have dry mouth anymore. I don’t produce saliva like I used to, but it’s not the Sahara desert like when my symptoms started."

"Just keep them eyes lubricated as much as u can! Avoid corneal damage, really sucks and now I wear glasses and have the vision of mr magoo!"
Get compression socks. If nothing else.
"You may be swelling for any number of reasons, like vascular disease. I'd get it looked at; maybe time for a check-in with the rheumy? Do you have small-fiber neuropathy complications?"
Thank you! I will 🦶
"Thanks! That explains why googling 'swollen feet' hasn't shed much light! Based on a quick search for SFN, I don't think I've experienced this. Yet!"

Yes I do need to get it checked out but find it very difficult to get appointments being a full time teacher with a lengthy commute!

"Thank you though, I'll try compression socks and keep my journal until I can get to a rheumy!"
"Mine have always gone back and forth. So has my sister's (RA), and her friend's (Lupus.) My rheumatologist told me it's very common for it to do that."
I’d like to know about this too. Last month I had a positive ANA  1:320 homogenous And positive SSA. Was referred to rheumatologist who redid labs which were all negative. My pcp didn’t buy that so reran tests again yesterday which have come back as positive ANA 1:160 homogenous and SSA no longer positive on the high end of normal range.
"I feel much better. It was about a month of shortness of breath, muscle pain/twitching, headaches and costochondritis. I still get short of breath here and there but it’s not all day. And muscle pain remains but I can hold my toddler and get out of bed now. I don’t know what changed. Maybe it was a short flare? Or I had an infection? I guess the rheumatologist redid them bc they need them to do diagnose/treat? It was also a diff hospital system since my pcp practice doesn’t have a rheumatology specialty. Did this happen to you or were you wondering if it could?"
"I didn’t have a positive ANA for years so doctors who said I had an autoimmune disease said I didn’t after the negative ANA test came back. I was never symptomatic when blood work was done. Then, my ANA was positive a few years ago and I don’t think my rheumatologist has checked it since as they fluctuate."
Thanks! I'm hoping they can improve and \_not\_ go back!  :)
This is really interesting!  Do you feel better?  Do you have any theories on why the change happened?  Do you know why the rheumatologist redid your labs?  (I wonder if the docs sent them to different labs.)
So glad you feel better!  Are shortness of breath and costochondritis symptoms of Sjogren's?

\--My SSA # were really high.  Wondering if they can drop and if that would be significant.
Thanks!
"Better known as Plaquenil. Commonly prescribed for Sjogrens. Personally I had a bad experience with it, massive rash, and stopped taking it. Others swear by its efficacy so maybe start small and see how you go"
"It took about 4 months for me to notice a difference. Not a miracle drug for me, but it definitely helped me feel less fatigued."
"I have been on it for a few months and haven't felt anything. No results, no side effects. I'm giving it a few more months, since it takes a while to do anything. I had a pretty badly upset stomach for a few weeks after starting. It took some effort to power through that."
I had improvement after 4-6 weeks.
For me it was a silver bullet with most my symptoms. So much happier and healthier on it.

"Edit: a word, because mobile sucks"
On it for a week now.  Nothing to report yet.
Given that I react badly to 75% of meds.  That’s a good sign.
Supposed to take a long time.

I did have a lot of luck not eating for a month to calm down a flare.
"I have Scleroderma, Sjögrens and Fibromyalgia and I’ve been on it for about a year.  It has quieted my diseases some and after about 5 months I noticed that the fatigue was no longer at the debilitating level. I still have flares and I still have to limit what I do, but I can participate in more."

Best of luck to you
"I tried so many OTC drops for that horrible feeling of a million papercuts across my eyeballs. The only thing that really works for me is prescription Xiidra. My insurance has an $80 copay, but Xiidra has a coupon thing that brings it down to $5. The pharmacy tech high-fived me when she keyed it in 😂"
"TheraTears are good. For Costco members, Refresh Plus box of 100 vials for less than $20."
My eye dr. recommended Systane and Theratears.
Refresh Optive Mega-3 is what I use. They’re preservative free.
"Ya with insurance they have it listed as a “we don’t know if this works so we won’t cover it” here, so the coupon makes it $256 a box. That’s $500 for a months supply but my wife typically is able to make it last a little longer."
"I use the Costco ones, my mom also has sjogrens and the Costco ones aren't lucrative enough for her but mine is definitely more mild then hers so they work for me."
Same situation. $500 a month for eye drops is ridiculous. Thinking of visiting Canada
I’ve had Medicare with BcBs and it’s a union plan and I don’t have dental coverage. You would have to buy extra dental coverage and I hear that’s not worth the cost.
Ugh....  that’s what I was afraid of.

Thank you for your reply.   I will definitely look into Healing Kitchen.   I personally know I did not eat my veggies and fruits growing up and even into adulthood.   I feel like i was nutritiously starving myself with processed food and that my autoimmune disease probably stems from that.  How long were you on the elimination period?  I have gotten the paleo approach book but are there any others you would recommend?  I am finding it confusing to know what to eliminate and for how long so hopefully that will help.
I have been trying plant based for about a month but really would love to get off medications and if I can do it by omitting certain foods I am willing to try.  I have been off dairy for awhile anyways as it does not agree with me.  I hate to give up my walnuts though but will do it to see what my triggers are.  From what I have read it sounds promising as it will at least make me feel better even if still taking medication.   Thank you for all your advice and I am glad you are seeing improvement so that gives me hope.  🙂

"I haven't, but I am part of a sjogren's support group where many members have. I hope you get answers!"
I had shingles a couple of months before the onset of my symptoms and my diagnosis so it could be related.
"Shortly after the shingles I started having a lot of pain and fatigue. At the time I attributed it to stress and tiredness from completing my masters degree so it was months before I really started looking into it and seeing a rheumatologist, so I never brought up shingles with them."
I didn’t have it as an indicator of the disease but I’ve had shingles 3 times since my diagnosis.
"Herpes viruses like Epstein Barr (Mono) have been linked to a number of autoimmune conditions, and outbreaks are more common in those with immune issues (cold sore outbreaks are in the same virus family as chickenpox/shingles)."

Good luck in your diagnosis hunt! It certainly sounds like potential Sjogren's Syndrome from your description.

"As a side note, I would recommend that anyone with an immune system disorder like Sjogren's Syndrome look into the new shingles vaccine (Shingrix), which is up to 97% effective at preventing Shingles outbreaks, especially if you are 50 and older (younger patients will likely have to pay out of pocket)."

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html)
"One thing I can give advice on as someone that gets shingles quite often is if you feel it coming on, like any tenderness, take l-lysine supplements. It’s saved me from steroids and antivirals numerous times."
I had shingles a year before I was diagnosed.
I had a bad break out of shingles in March right after a bad flu/cold episode and I’m going to a new Rhuemy. The last one ran labs. I was SSA and SSB positive. He wants to do a lip biopsy. Hoping you feel better soon.
Me too - no shingles but seems very common with us.

&#x200B;

"P.S. Been piggy-backing on your comments lately, /u/Booksandcats. I LOVE your username! We have a lot in common, ha."
Why does he want lip biopsy if you are SSA and SSB positive?
"Aww, that's awesome! I am a big fan of helping if I can as it's such an overwhelming disease. I'm sad about my username typo 😞."
"Didn't even notice the typo!!! Aw man! Yeah, Sjogren's sucks. Worse club ever!"
Both my mother and her brother got cataracts in their 50s...I don't \*think\* they have sjogrens...but I do. Curious about this as well...still in my 20s...but definitely following this post.
"I had cataracts develop like dots throughout my eyes within a 3 month period and had to have surgery in both eyes. This happened about 5 years ago. My doctors didn’t attribute it to Sjogrens, No one had ever seen them so quickly or in such a weird pattern. They never said they thought it was the Sjogrens but I always wondered if it wasn’t at least part of the problem, especially since I was younger then when you hear most people develop cataracts."
"Your story sounds very familiar. Sjogrens and lupus love to occur together. I have both, but rheumy couldn't tell which presented first. I think Sjogrens once I understood what it was. I do get chills, too. Sometimes it's like I just can't regulate my body temp. I hope you get some helpful answers and a beneficial treatment plan."
"Thank you! Rheumy put me on plaquenil (generic) even without formal diagnosis, as it can't hurt. I look deformed when my parotids are super inflamed. I call them my gills."
Generic Zantac. (Ranitidine)
"Yeah so I eat a lot of slippery food. A banana everyday. Peaches, nectarines and jelly type things. Also, i have Irish Moss, okra and molokano in many of my meals."
"I add linseed to everything. I put a pinch in my water to give it more slip and ""staying power"" otherwise I feel thirsty immediately after drinking. I boil it into a gel and use it on my hair and skin. I use aloe Vera gel for my skin and put some in my mouth before bed. I'm sure it tastes disgusting but my taste buds are mostly shot anyway."
"I get pretty bad acid reflux, mainly from low stomach acid, so antacids actually make it worse in the long run. If your stomach can't fully digest the food it causes issues. So if I'm eating protein I take an HCL supplement. And if I'm having a period with a lot of reflux, then I will drink apple cider vinegar (diluted) once or twice a day. If you decide to try ACV, make sure to get the organic kind with the mother."

"I also avoid red meat, as I find that hardest to digest. Something to think about."
I do sometimes. I started tracking what I was eating to see if certain things didn't agree with me and I have a few things I avoid now to try to help that.

"Generally, think about how you need more moisture than the average person. If you're eating something dry, add sauce, dip, dressing, gravy, or something to it to help you digest it easier. I like spray on avocado oil, especially for veggies."

I have become a fan of protein shakes and soups because they really seem to agree with me.
Thank you! I’m veggie and gluten free :) I will try the ACV more often...  (I have Bragg’s cause of the mother)

I’m being tested for IBD in two weeks time.. don’t want another illness to add to the list but I am in pain.
"I had swollen lymph nodes in my armpits periodically & in my neck for more prolonged periods of time. These symptoms would usually correlate with stress. Currently I don't have a sjogrens diagnosis, but just a undifferentiated connective tissue disease diagnosis. My rheumatologist thinks it's either early or mild lupus. My mom has sjogrens & mild lupus. Some of my other symptoms include dry eyes, stiff hands, a weird rash or two. But a lot of times the symptoms don't always happen at the same time for me, but the swollen lymph nodes in my armpits are definitely stress related for me & usually go away on its own. I have been on plaquenil for about 9 months now. I think it's helping."

"Not sure what you are looking for, but hope this helps! It seems like everyone's autoimmune diseases can vary so much, it can be frustrating. But you're not alone!"
"I get swollen lymph nodes in my armpits, occasionally also in my neck or around the groin. Diagnosed with both undifferentiated connective tissue disease and sjogrens. My doc says stress definitely can cause that inflammation as well as just feeling a little under the weather. Sometimes it stays like that for about a month but I get routine bloodwork to make sure it’s not anything else, which it never has been. I’ve taken Hydroxychloroquine for about 2 years now. Didn’t have any improvement until 6 months and it was minimal. After another few months it really began to help my symptoms. For dry eyes I got restasis which also took time to start working but drastically helped."
I used to get them a lot.

I was using a very strong antiperspirant -deodorant.  (I don't know why because I don't really sweat much).
"But, I stopped using it and switched to a totally different milder brand and haven't had any underarm swollen glands since (its been a few years now).   It's was almost like my sweat glands needed to be able sweat some."
"Thank you! This does help, they went away for a little bit but have been around for months hopefully it is just stress"
Thank you!
"I hope so too! But who knows. The ones in my armpits would usually stick around for a couple of days but in my neck it's almost just a constant. My rheumatologist doesn't seem concerned about it, so I try not to be too concerned. Glad someone else has this issue too! :)"
Same! Makes feel not alone. Do you get them near collarbone too? Those one freak me out the most
Not quite! They're usually on the side of my neck.
"All the time, whenever my Sjogren's is flaring. I use a damp washrag, as hot as I can safely stand it, and just lay it over my closed eyes until it cools. I try to do it least twice a day, but more often is probably better. That seems to help them clear up quicker."

"I also like Xylimelts for dry mouth, or Biotene products."
"In addition to using warm compresses, you'll probably want to start cleaning your lids and lash line. Styes and blepharitis are pretty common for people like us. OCuSOFT makes a cleaner called [Hypochlor](https://smile.amazon.com/OCuSOFT-Hypochlorous-Associated-Blepharitis-Dysfunction/dp/B013M57VZG) that's highly recommended by eye doctors. I've been using it for a while and it's helped quite a bit."
Only one of my lids bother me it’s been this way since the beginning so strange.
Any xylitol gum will help with dry mouth
"Thanks for the response, I will try xylimelts!"
"If over the counter lubricating drops, gel drops and gel aren't working well enough for you, see an ophthalmologist who can test amount and quality of your tears, prescribe meds and/or insert punctal plugs. Documented eye test results that show dryness can also help the rheumatologist make a Sjogren's diagnosis."

An ENT doctor can test your saliva volume and salivary glands which can also help the rheumatologist make a SS diagnosis.  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869415313343](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869415313343)

"In the meantime, having a humidifier in the room helps with dryness symptoms."
Pilocarpine and cevimeline are two medications that stimulate the salivary glands. I do not have a diagnosis and in fact I don’t even think I have sjögren’s now but my rheumatologist still prescribed pilocarpine as per my request. I just got it yesterday so I have not tried it yet. I’ll update soon and let you know.
I use over the counter drops that work wonders with my eyes. Zaduitor 2x a day and blink tears when I need something else.

Also...dont wear contacts. That will help a lot. I stopped wearing contacts and went to glasses a huge difference.
Thanks.  I am taking cevimeline for the dry mouth.. it helps a little bit for maybe an hour; I think my dryness is just more severe than what it can help with.
"Ah, I didn’t realize you are already on it. Unfortunately both that and pilocarpine aren’t known to really work all that well. Makes sense, if your salivary glands are nearly destroyed, stimulating them isn’t going to help all that much..."
"If cevimeline (generic for evoxac) isn't working, try the brand name evoxac or their alternative, brand name salagen with generic name pilocarpine."
I have it too! What has helped me is taking 2x daily a compounded B complex supplement. I can go from barely noticing to major pain and numbness if I go off. Also low dose naltrexone is helping pain levels from fibro and neuropathy lessen. Look into laser and led light therapies. And if you have neuropathy and sjogrens insurance will sometimes pay for ivig whic does reverse or improve 50% of neuropathy as well as modulate immune system.
Is neuropathy common with Sjogren?
"It can happen, but I don't think it is common. I am badly afflicted :( ."
"Neuropathy was the catalyst to getting my diagnosis of Sjögren’s- while I don’t think everyone with Sjögren’s experiences neuropathy, I think it’s probably more common than what is currently realized/diagnosed by physicians. I had 2 highly regarded Neurologists explain the cause of my neuropathy to be from the Ebstein Barr Virus after contracting mono at the age of 33. My neuropathy started as just pins and needles in my hands when I woke up in the mornings and quickly progressed to agonizing burning from my fingertips to my elbows. It lasted throughout the entire day and for worse at night. After 2 EMG’s and Nerve Conduction Studies, followed by 2 separate skin biopsies, over $8,000 worth of blood work and finally a lip biopsy to remove and test salivary glands, the 3rd Neurologist along with a Rheumatologist at The Mayo Clinic FINALLY diagnosed me with Sjögren’s and are convinced that is what has caused my neuropathy. After starting treatment for what they describe as “Type 1” or “Primary” Sjögren’s, my neuropathy has been greatly reduced and is now tolerable. After speaking with the doctors at Mayo, they are realizing that Sjögren’s isn’t always the “mild, less acute or troubling” autoimmune disorder they used to believe it to be. It can be equally as debilitating as any other well know autoimmune disease such as Lupus or Rheumatoid Arthritis. You’re not alone."
**Side Note: my Vitamin B6 Levels have consistently been off the charts HIGH- as high as 158.8. My B12 and Folate levels have always been within normal range and I take no daily vitamins that could explain this anomaly. While B vitamins can often help with neuropathy- be sure they are looking at the full spectrum before taking any supplements. I can only imagine how much worse my neuropathy could have gotten had my doctors placed me on a B vitamin supplement- probably causing B6 Toxicity which itself can cause neuropathy.**
So what are you doing for your sjorens
Personally I didn't even feel like my mouth was dry at all. Had a lip biopsy and it was positive Sjogren's. I didn't notice how dry my mouth had been until I got on meds and realized how much better it could be.
"With an ANA titre of 1:640 it is very likely that you have an ongoing autoimmune process of some form.  However, that alone is not sufficient for diagnosis of any specific disease.   Formal diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome, as with any other autoimmune disease, requires an aggregate of physical and/or biochemical symptoms/results - +ve ANA alone is not a disease.   Have they tested for SS-A or SS-B antibodies?  That would add to the list of signs that are potentially suggestive of Sjogrens.  I am assuming that you have dry eyes or something else that is leading your doc to believe that you might have Sjogren's?"

"For what it is worth, I received my formal diagnosis of Sjogren's last week.  I too had a throat that was much drier than my mouth. I also had +ve ANA, +ve SS-A, dry eyes, and swollen submandibular glands for 6+ months.  Despite my thinking my mouth wasn't that dry, my rheumatologist told me it was quite dry on visual examination - guess I had just been used to it that way.  I didn't need a lip biopsy for final confirmation."

Good luck.


I thank you so much for your comment :) The ENA-Screening was negative. As far as I know does that mean I don't have SS-A/-B-Antibodies?

"I have a dry throat (difficulties while eating, speaking, dry cough, ...), nose and eyes. My mouth is also dry, but not that much (or at least I think it's not that bad). I also have painful joints and muscles, fatigue and the raynaud-syndrome. That's why we're checking for Sjogren's."

"I wish you all the best, too."
So that biopsy really isn't necessary if all the other pieces fit? I was bugging my doc about Hashis testing and mentioned I wanted to talk to her about restasis because my eyes are horrible as well as some other issues. She brought up sjogrens. I asked her about being tested for that and she was in a hurry at that point. I'm not faulting her for that because she very obviously had a packed day and had already taken a while with me to talk through stuff. That whole biopsy thing just trips me out a bit.
"It is possible to have Sjogren's without a positive SS-A or SS-B.  I suspect that given the negative ENA screening and the not so dry mouth, that you doc felt that the lip biopsy would be required to formally diagnose Sjogren's."

"One test I have seen others comment on is the Sjo test - it also does not formally diagnose Sjogren's either, but it might provide additional supportive information (and might be easier than a lip biopsy)."
"I agree, this does seem possible."
Thank you for the informations :-)
Username checks out.
I keep eye drops and lotion in my purse at all times. After waking up with bone dry sinuses this morning I may add saline nasal spray. I have a purple makeup bag that I can put it all in.
"Prednisone. Eye drops, q-tips, water, advil."
"Does anyone else find that saline nasal spray makes things much worse? I end up mouth breathing until it clears out of my nasal passages. I've tried multiple kinds and I've taken it at various times of the day, but it leads to pure misery."
"Yeah. I'm a big fan of Fallout so I found a bag that says ""Rad-Away"" on it and that's where I keep my chapstick, eye drops, pain pills, hand cream, mouth spray (Biotene), wet wipes, xylitol gum, and some other stuff like nail clippers."
The gel's work good for Lupe.
"I will take a peak, haven't heard of them."
Thanks for the pointer.
I'll have to give it a try. Thanks!
"No, but my rheumy did get me tested for it last month because my lungs are also causing me a lot of problems. So yes, I guess it can be related."
I have lungs problems. Short of breath. They only found swollen lymph nodes behind my lungs near aorta. My lymphocytes are always high.
"I haven’t had either of those things specifically, but my Sjögren’s does attack my lungs and has caused permanent lung damage."
Hmmm..I have decreased lymphocytes and Sjogrens. No pulmonary nodules thank goodness.
Do you have pulmonary fibrosis?
"No, I was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease about 5 years ago."
"Yes. I had one on the left side of my face for 5-7 years. In the beginning it was small but over a couple of years it got bigger,  large enough to be visible if I didn't cover my cheek with my hair. In the beginning I went to the hospital to have it drained (doctor inserted syringe in the cheek) but it was always back within 3 days, so they thought it a waste of time. Then I bought my own syringes and did it myself before going out (NOT advisable for a lot of reasons, but I was desperate. I felt it dominated my whole face)."

"At the same time I also kept getting very bad inflammations in the parotid glands that kept me in the hospital for a week each time. Xrays showed that there were a lot of cysts blocking the saliva passages. They decided to try to enlarge the passageways in an operation. Unfortunately the lump was just impossible to reach, but they did make the rest of the passageways larger and I stopped getting constant inflammations. Perhaps it worked a bit on the lump too, for some time after the operation it started to get gradually smaller. It was very slowly but it did finally disappear completely."
I quit plaquenil after [this study](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/828320) came out and didn't notice any difference. Saves my insurance a bunch of money...

I love prednisolone with all of my heart. I wish I could take it all the time. It makes me feel normal again.
"One of my parotid glands left a permanent exterior swelling that I've now had for 25 years. Looking at the gland on the inside, it's totally mangled and doesn't look anything like the other one. That said, my salivary glands, including the tiny ones under my lower lip, just keep slowly enlarging and getting lumpier."
"I can't see the study, but I assume that it's like the others that found no significant value in it. I'm always so stunned when people claim that it worked so well for fatigue, etc. I tend to assume it's the placebo effect."
Yup no better than placebo I wonder why rheumatologists even prescribe it any more.
Doesn't it reduce the number of antibodies? That could slow down the progress of the disease. It might not help with the symptoms since the damage is already done.
Do you have a study that shows that? I can't see it's worth the risk to my vision when it doesn't improve any symptoms.

"There was never any evidence other than anecdotal, they just threw it at sjogren's because they thought it *might* help and it became a thing."
"CeraVe, Cetaphil, or Eucerin are your best options. I personally use Eucerin for some body parts that need more thick moisture that lasts and CeraVe for thinner lotion that soaks in faster."
"I use Aveeno it works for me. My nails are awful, The Body Shop's Amazonian Saviour is making a difference to them."
"I have had Hashimotos hypothyroidism since I was 9, and I am 31 now. My whole life I suffered debilitating symptoms and very seldomly do I respond well to the Levo! It takes about a year at 225mcg for my body to respond well, and my thyroid goes into hyper, but when they lower the dose my levels go down way too low. It's such a battle! I had Epstein-Barr first then later diagnosed with Hashimotos. It ruined my highschool years as I never felt well. It has been a struggle during and after the birth of both of my children. I could never lose weight properly post partum. Ive suffered chronic ear, nose and throat problems. Migraines, and always malaise. Was diagnosed shortly after my daughters birth in 2010 with fibro. Her birth was very very tough on my immune system. I feel into opioid drug addiction and later turned to heroin which I am now 5 years clean from both. I do a Suboxone program which really helps how I feel, but some days are still unbearable. I was only diagnosed with Sjogrens a few months ago, after having consistently dry red eyes, and noticed when my eyes hurt badly, my muscles were very weak, and tired, and had trouble staying awake. I lost feeling in my left foot for two months. My eyes have been sensitive to bright lights since I was about 10, and flourescent lighting makes my eyes SO red. I now lose feeling in my hands and wrists while sleeping, which is a new symptoms. While under immense stress, I have gotten what I call ""monster eye"" where one eye swells up, and last year they treated me for pink eye, but the antibiotic drops did nothing and I now realize it was a Sjogrens flare up and should have been treated with oral Prednisone. I get lymph node swelling behind my ear and mild swelling near my temples, and also at base of the skull, which creates a headache like feeling. The skin on my face has become sensitive and red, and I've lost hair in my face eyelashes. I really do think the SS is secondary to Lupus but I am still being studied, ugh. I pray for you and for everyone affected by autoimmune diseases because they are SO under rated. You are not alone! Hugs to you Xoxoxo"
See my post history.  Lots of similarities.    Fibromyalgia is common with Sjögren.  Adderal fixes my fatigue quite dramatically.
Fighting same battle.  See my post history on /r/Sjogrens

Normal blood tests are common.

Interestingly a round of antibiotics will often reduce symptoms.

My doctor says to run if the rheumatologist doesn't believe that.

&#x200B;
"There is an early marker blood test that my RH did that came back positive.  Only one lab in the country does it, so your dr. may not be aware of it.  Ask them"
Sounds horrible! I've noticed the skin on my face getting very sensitive and red in the last year but never thought about it being related to all these other things... Appreciate your positive thoughts and same to you!
Thanks!
What is the test called? Just in case they aren't aware of it when I ask. Thanks!
"It is ""SS Early"""
"Ask your doctor about it or see a dermatologist to be sure, but that sounds like one of the common side effects (its not to my knowledge a typical Sjorgren's symptom). Plaquenil is supposed to be pretty innocuous, especially when you are on a lower dose, but it affects everyone differently."
"I also started taking Plaquenil a little over a month ago. I have some all over itchiness (not normal for me) and tiny red dots sporadically on my skin, mainly on my legs and torso."
I had some weird side effect from plaquenil. Tingling sensations all over. And at one point burning sensation in my legs; it was awful. My rheumatologist found it best to stop.
"Yes this sounds like what’s happening to me. I also read somewhere online that the itching often goes away, so we can hope for that!"
Oh wow that sounds awful. Did your symptoms improve after you stopped the Plaquenil?
"I had the itching when i first started plaquenil too. Although mine was always a result of being exposed to the sun (photosensitivity os a side effect), and that shit is real.  It does go away though."
But i also got hives after too long (1 hour) in the sun in jeans and a tshirt.
I've been on it for 15 months now. No hives since that one time. Very little itching.
I hope it subsides for you.
You're not alone. And yeah.... sometimes it's just a Sjogren's thing
"This is an old post, but did the rash go away? I just started on Plaquenil a couple weeks ago and the rash just started two days ago."
It kind of comes and goes... it’s so weird. I went about one week without itching but then a few new spots appeared. Right now I’m rash free again though so we’ll see if it stays away for good!
"Yep, it was quite awful... luckily, the tingling and burning went away as the medicine slowly got out of my system."
My rheumatologist gives me a short course of steroids (usually Prednisone) when my parotid glands get angry. Takes them down in just a couple of days. I’d ask about that so you aren’t living with swollen glands!
"Hot compresses. My ENT also recommended ""milking"" them- i.e. pushing up and towards the center of the face starting down behind the ear. When mine are really swollen it's too painful and probably not helpful- but when I notice them first starting to swell, like if I'm trying to eat something solid in the morning, I can usually do it and it helps. Same with lozenges- if they're already swollen it is usually too painful for me personally but if it's just beginning to swell it can help stimulate flow and prevent some of the swelling. If yours comes and goes it's something you could maybe try, but if they're just constantly swollen I would stick with NSAIDs and hot compresses."
"Update: So I started taking Prednisone (1 week gone, 1 left). My glands are back to normal but I can feel multiple small nodes in my cheeck and below my ear. I'm guessing those are lymph nodes? Is it normal for them to swell as well?"
"Do you already take omega-3s? I take 2000 mg (a combination of fish oil and flax oil) daily for dry eye, but I think it has helped my nails a lot too."

Edit: I also use a strengthening polish from the brand Nailtiques (formula 2) and a good cuticle oil.
I’ve been taking biotin recently and it’s strengthened my nails a bit. They’re still fairly short but my nails haven’t been splitting down the middle as much (rarely).
Sorry I haven't but my nails are dreadful now too. My toe nails are particularly bad. I've tried so many things & nothing has helped. I'd be interested if anyone has a solution too.
I've recently started adding a clear protein builder top coat and using vitamin e oil around my nail beds and it's helping quite a bit more than I expected. I haven't had any new nail chippage in almost a week now
I used to have this problem but now people think my natural nails are FAKE!

"Take fish oil daily, use oil on your cuticles daily and heavy-duty cream on your actual nails when bare. Always use a strengthening base and a chip-resistant top coat even if you don't want color. I never do but SHOULD be using gloves anytime I do dishes/clean/etc., but I just try to limit my water exposure since that type of moisture makes nails temporarily weak."

&#x200B;

"It took me a long time to find the brands I really like, so you might have to play around and see what fits you:"

"**Fish oil** (which might also help with other dryness symptoms): Kyani Sunset (has a bunch of other good stuff in it, too)"

**Oil:** Pure Cold Pressed Natural Unrefined Jojoba Oil by Leven Rose

**Cream:** Nivea Creme

**Strengthening polish:** Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener (this stuff is AMAZING)

**Topcoat:** Essie Gel Couture Top Coat (twisted bottle)

"When it comes to tools, I exclusively use Tweezerman brand products. Keep 'em short until they're strong. I've also just started taking flaxseed oil daily but not long enough to see results- maybe look into for you?"

"(This has become quite the hobby for me, as you can see...)"
"Blood tests never showed anything for me, only lip biopsy did. :/"
"As far as I know the blood test shows if you're in the ""normal range"". That's not necessarily your normal range but the average of everyone. I had this problem with a blood test for an early menopause & I know many people having problems with blood tests for other issues. Your blood test only shows levels for the exact time it was taken."
Regarding diabetes vs Sjögren's Syndrome... I have both. Diabetes will make you thirsty. Sjögren's Syndrome will make you dry. They are distinctly different.

"A specialist in Sjögren's Syndrome can evaluate more than your bloodwork. For instance, my rheumatologist, also a researcher, measures saliva flow and volume, does in-clinic saliva gland ultrasounds, and a Schirmer's eye test."
Do you have any other symptoms that might point to Sjogren as the cause?
Is your doctor a specialist or just a general practitioner? S/he may not be knowledgeable enough to make an accurate diagnosis.

"Here is some information that may be helpful. You can have features of Sjogren's without having the Ro/Ra antibodies. For example, I have dry eyes and mouth but negative on the antibodies. I am positive for Rheumatoid factor and have some other funky blood work- therefore, my diagnosis is undifferentiated connective tissue disease with Sjogren's features."

Also I am sure you know that dry mouth is a sign of insulin resistance or prediabetes so I recommend getting those checked if you have not already.

Best wishes in your pursuit of better health.
"My wife has this, among other things.  She quit producing tears, maybe 3 or so years ago.  Has dry mouth so bad, it cracks.  Can't swallow food, has been on a liquid diet for about 3 months now."
"I'm late to the party, but there are OTC lozenges by Thera Breathtaking could be benificial to you and if you haven't scheduled an appointment with a dentist you need to do so. Dry mouth can cause your teeth to rot as it weakens the enamel."
Do you think I should push for a lip biopsy? Or should that be a last resort?
Do you think I should push for more tests?
"I don’t have dry eyes, but my skin does seem dry sometimes. Then again, the dry skin could have other causes."
"My doctor is just a general practitioner, so you’re right, she may not have a lot of knowledge on the subject."

She seemed concerned about diabetes but that was ruled out in the tests. But I don’t think I was tested for a rheumatoid factor.

"My mother had rheumatoid arthritis, but I didn’t think it was hereditary."
Insulin resistance and prediabetes cause thirst more so than dryness. They are very different from Sjögren's dryness due to the processes involved.
I’m so sorry about your wife—that sounds horrible.
"I'm in no way medically qualified but, if it was me, I'd ask for another blood test in a few months."
"I have kidney stones too. I don’t see the nephrologist until next week, I just can’t find any information that isn’t a medical lecture."
Urologist thinks I have it but says testing won’t solve much. I make many kidney stones.
"I have not. Sorry to hear about it. :-( I did have a very painful kidney stone though, and it turned out my diet was way too high in oxalates...I had been eating lots of spinach and almonds. I stopped eating those so much and I drink more lemonade for the citric acid. The lemonade really helped break up my first / only kidney stone so far. I don't know anything about your condition... That's just what I've experienced with my kidneys."
"Yes! I’ve had 27 kidney stone surgeries, over 350 stones. Miserable."
"YES! RTA type 1! I’ve had over 350 stones, 27 stone surgeries and haven’t been stone free since my first one. Currently both kidneys have multiple stones in them."
"I’m so sorry to hear that. Do you need a special diet? I haven’t had surgery for stones yet, but it’s coming. The pain... I feel for you. Any suggestions for relief?"
Thank you!! No special diet. We’ve tried but didn’t keep stones from forming.
"Tips: walking helps when you’re colicky with a stone. Pain meds, hot bath or shower, laying on a heating pad! I hope that helps a little!"
"I’ve done AIP and if you can be 100% strict with it, it probably does work. Depends quite a lot on what kind of a diet you have right now. Like I was already avoiding many forbidden AIP things so for me the change wasn’t THAT drastic. But I still just wasn’t able to stick to it 100%. So now I still eat quite well but some of the forbidden stuff and let’s just say I can see it on my overall wellbeing, more fatigue etc."

"With dry mouth though I didn’t see any differences, only on my energy levels and stomach aches."

"And you should eat organic meat, it’s just so much better. It’s not the end of the world if you cheat on that sometimes, but mostly try to eat organic."
"I am currently on full AIP, and have been since June. I was diagnosed in April, and was waiting for my first rheumatologist appointment in September. I wanted to try something before meeting my new doctor since I had a long wait. It didn’t help with the dryness, but it helped TREMENDOUSLY with fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, digestive issues, and a lot of other various issues I had before starting AIP. I have tried two reintroductions so far, ghee and green beans. Ghee was a huge success, green beans (which I thought would be really easy) caused digestive issues for me, so those are out. It goes to show that some things we think are healthy and eating every day could be causing harm."

"I buy organic when I can afford to. I try to especially when getting a fatty cut of meat for a roast, etc. because the fat is where a lot of toxins are stored. All organic grass fed is really expensive here in the US too. I would say just do the best you can, it’s better if you’re adhering to the protocol than buying all organic, IMHO. Best of luck in your healing!"
Hi I am on an AIP diet - it helps lessen my symptoms but im still progressing with it. I need to go back and really make sure i have no SIBO or Leaky gut otherwise my understanding is ALL foods will cause immune reactions b/c they can enter blood stream and SIBO causes its own nastiness. So look into glutamine or bone borth supplemnts to really heal the gut at the same time. Also after a while this diet gets easy - there are good substitutes and you wont feel too deprived after a while. It just takes more planning and work. I hope it is all you need to feel better. It very well may be.
I eat AiP and aip/ keto but I have gotten worse. I just think it slowed it down for me. If I go off it I do get worse. But hasn’t been cuaritive. But that’s just me. Some people just cut out gluten and all their issues vanish so worth a try🙏
It's a massive diet change for me so hopefully it works. I'm willing to stick to it if it helps the fatigue/joint issues/digestive problems but sad to hear it doesn't seem to help with dryness.

Yeah looking online the price for grass fed meat to be delivered from a butcher is way more expensive than store bought but I've read a few times that beef in the UK is usually on mostly a grass fed diet anyway (though I guess that might not be the case coming into winter).
"Oh! And I meant to say the thing that has been a miracle for dryness for me is the drug my rheumatologist prescribed: Evoxac. I am amazed! I don’t love taking medication, but I tried it as a trial run and I wouldn’t give it up for anything. Perhaps your doctor can give you something similar?"
Same situation as me then with regards to wanting to try something productive while waiting to see the rheumatologist.  Yeah unfortunately it doesn't seem to help anyone with dryness but its nice to see you've had such positive results with everything else! How long was it before you started seeing results on AIP? Thankyou and best of luck with your own ongoing battles :)
"Cheers for the reply! Posted 3 months ago and literally just started Sunday was a weird coincidence for a comment to pop up here now haha. Head feels a bit more clear already but I'm getting a lot of aches, maybe due to going from high carb to low & cutting out all the crap. I'll give it a couple months at least."
"If you are currently eating dairy products or gluten and will give up on them now on AIP for the first time, well, you will most definitely see a huge improvement! I gave up on both of those four years ago when I realized they contributed so much to joint pains and to overall discomfort. For me those have been the worst, but with giving up on all the possible irritation causes while on AIP I felt so much lighter."

Organic meat is really expensive here where I live (Finland) as well so AIP was really heavy on my budjet. Although even after stopping that I have still only bought organic for ethical reasons.
"I hope this isn’t too discouraging to hear, but it took about two and a half months before I started to see positive improvements in my symptoms. I have read a lot about healing from AIP and a lot of people said that the damage wasn’t done in a week or a month, so it will take longer than a week or a month to heal. That really helped me put it all in perspective. I am going about my reintroduction phase very slowly and cautiously because I don’t want to destroy the progress I’ve made so far. We’ll get through this together ❤️"
I think anything to lower I flammation is going to help which is why it’s s permanent way of eating. It just requires cooking and prep and I hate that bc I’m so tired. I hope it works for you 😊
"Not at all! It's not gonna be easy but if I can rid of this fatigue/brain fog it will be well worth it to me. Keep me posted on how your reintroductions go, good luck! And thanks for the evoxac suggestion, dry mouth is my most annoying symptom so I will definitely give that a try. Thanks again!"
Yeah the food prep is killing me but hopefully it'll be worth it hahaha nice one
"That was better than what I got. I was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disorder. It's when you have Sjogrens, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis all at once. They gave me the plaquenil and said to make sure to get an eye Dr appt because they need baseline tests done since apparently one of the drug side effects is blindness."

"I was on eye drops Restasis, but then my insurance (if you want to call it that) decided they weren't covering it so that's it. I'm not sure if they were working or not."

6 month follow up and that's it.

"The eye Dr is even worse. They put in punctal duct plugs (which scratch) to try to keep in as much moisture as possible. Then they tell you to buy preservative free eyedrops and put them in whenever needed. I'm like I'm going through tubes of this a day. He said just keep doing it. That's it, that's all my Dr has done. Unfortunately my Sjogrens is way down on my priority list as far as pain and limbs falling apart."

I have to ask my mom tomorrow because I think at one point she was looking into me going to Austin for treatments. I'm in Dallas. She might still remember some of the names of the highly  recommended people. Trouble is that they have really really long waiting lists. You may not see someone for a year unless you're lucky enough to get a cancellation.
Do you have insurance? I called my insurance company and they gave me a list of all the specialist they cover. It made it so easy for me to call and narrow my search down.
[deleted]
Sorry to hear about the diagnosis. I recommend building up your own support network so that you have better exposure to this information. Here's a list of [support groups in Texas](https://www.sjogrens.org/home/get-connected/support-groups/us-support-groups/texas). The information you need might literally be a phone call away.

You might also consider attending the national [Sjogren's patient conference](https://www.sjogrens.org/home/get-connected/patient-seminars) next year. When I attend conferences I usually leave with some really good contacts in areas that I'd like to know more about. Good luck.
"If you'e like my wife, you'll need a team rather than just one physician."

"We took all of my wife's care to a university level medical center where you have specialists on staff for everything.  They can more easily coordinate care, medical records, and so on.  Often the physicians will know each other."
"I'd recommend you to my rheumatologist, but unfortunately I think the drive from Austin to Dallas might be bit much for you.  I would use your insurance's doctor finding tool (on their website) to find rheumatologists in your area and simply ask about their experience treating sjogren's patients."
"Do you have a university-associated hospital or physicians' group near you? I'm in Wisconsin and go to one of those. They have a rheumatologist that specializes in Sjögren's Syndrome and also does research in it. So, by being a patient, you are getting cutting-edge evaluations, like salivary gland ultrasounds, at your visits."
"I’m so sorry for your bad experience and all your troubles. This is precisely why I’m looking to get in with a competent doctor who cares. If your mother recalls anything, please pass it along. Any information you can pass along would be appreciated. I’m still on the hunt."
"Hi, I'm sorry for what you are going through. My wife got diagnosed the same (Lupus, Sjogrens and rheumatoid arthritis), she is 30 and has tremendous pain in her arms, shoulders, hands and body in general. I want to help her and do more, can you point me in the right direction on informative sources, subreddits, what to do?. Her diagnosis is new, was given to her a few months ago but I can see how it's developing quickly."

"Her doctor was really vague as well (this was in italy, now we moved to Barcelona - Spain and we are getting another specialist to follow her treatment)."

"Thank you! And stay in touch, reach out if you want whenever, so I can also share with you what is working out for us."
"Yes, I’m covered. I think most rheumatologists in the area accept my insurance. I’m really looking for a person or practice that places a particular focus on Sjogren’s."
No worries. Thanks for the suggestion!
I will definitely look into the conference. I attended a Sjogren’s walk this morning and plan to attend the next quarterly meeting of our local support group. Thank you!
"Unfortunately I don’t know of anything like that in Austin. I have family in Houston and Dallas, so I’ll widenmy net and look there as well. Thank you!"
What's your rheumatologist? I take it you live in Dallas area? So do I. I currently use all my Drs out of Parkland but there's something about their rheumy clinic...
Someone else suggested this as well. I’m going to look into it. Thank you!
In Dallas we get care at UTSW. I would think UT would have a medical school in Austin.
I see Dr. Supriya Sehgal. She's part of the Methodist hospital system in Richardson. She's extremely familiar with Sjogrens and is very proactive about treatment.

Once I was referred to her all of my medical issues seemed to click into place because she isn't afraid to order MRIs for anything that hurts (as long as your insurance covers it and/or your willing to handle that financially) or to send you to a specialist for specific complaints. This was extremely helpful to me since my main presentation symptoms were joint pain and fatigue.

"Turns out I've managed to tear both of my meniscus in my knees, I have low bone density and damaged cartilage in my hands (complete with neuropathy, yay), and I have a bone spur in my neck that's been causing migraines since I was a teenager."

"I'm not going to lie, I have been frustrated with only getting about 20 minutes with her per visit as well as her not always remembering details from previous visits, but she listens to me and is willing to track down any issues I'm experiencing until I'm satisfied. All in all I think she's an excellent choice for someone who isn't happy with their current rheumatologist or doesn't know where to find one familiar with Sjogrens."
Thank you for the information!
"Preservative-free is best as preservatives can irritate the eye, and extended use of preservatives isn't good. That being said, most preservative-free is in vials. I like Refresh Plus. Bonus if you are a Costco member because they sell 100 packs. For bottled drops, I like TheraTears."
I discovered HYLO preservative free drops. Here they are made by Candor Vision. They can be bought prescription free but they are behind the counter. Effing$$$ but literally the only drops that don't burn AND last. Plus the pump dispenser is pretty sweet and eliminates over squeezing the bottle and wasting the product.
"I get this kind of pain and it can be not only extremely painful, but downright debilitating. I was told I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back (from x-rays) and tight IT band. Hmm, maybe it's sacrolitiitis. First time I'm hearing of it and it only started a while after SJS diagnosis. Either way, what helps me is an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen 800 mgs, massage, stretching and foam rolling. Best to do the last two regularly for preventative measure and/ or decreased occurrence/effects. During an acute situation /flare, I don't take the painkiller my doctor prescribed because painkillers make me very sedentary and depressed. Instead, I find it is best to be as active as I can be to facilitate and expedite recovery. Low dose valium (muscle relaxer) is good, though. I can be active on that and it also helps take my mind off things. :)"

ETA: This is the foam rolling video I use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khC5J1lkC7s
This was my first symptom of SS and the reason why I saw a rheumatologist. Plaquenil and NSAIDS caused it to complete go away after years of suffering. Now it’s coming back because I’m pregnant but I think it’s unrelated to the SS.
I have been dealing with this pain severely for about 6 months and couldn’t figure out what was causing it. Thanks for the information. Hoping you get some relief
TIL that's a thing.  I've been having a lot of hip/lower back pain lately that gets way way better after doing yoga and water aerobics.  I'll have to talk to my doctor about it.

&#x200B;

I'm currently on 150mg Plaquenil and one dose of 12-hour Tylenol Arthritis daily.  My doctor requested that I reserve NSAIDs for migraines and not take them every day due to some recent studies that indicate that daily use of NSAIDs may put you at risk of heart complications.  Apparently Tylenol isn't an NSAID.
"Thanks for the info. I will definitely keep the link in my saved videos and refer to it. I do find that being active does help with the pain. I am a bit uneasy taking ibuprofen daily as there is a risk that it can affect the liver. I will have to look further into that to really speak to that. I got a shot from the doctor for facet joint pain, but it only lasted one day. The doctor said that shot usually helps and is effective."
I wish that I could say plaquenil and NSAIDS would alleviate my pain. The only thing that helps remotely is to continue to be active. Congrats on your pregnancy. How far along are you?
Thanks. I hope you too find the relief you need. 😊
Tylenol isn’t an NSAID because it doesn’t reduce inflammation. I sure wish it did because the pain is from the inflammation. At least in my case. I have insertional tendinosis I’m both hips and in the insertion point for the hamstring of one. That is the one that causes me the most pain. I can deal with the pain from the rest of the issues. LOL.
"I have horrible reactions to pain meds, including aspirin and ibuprofen, so I don't take any.  Cannabis helps distract from the pain, but light exercise/activity seems to tamp it down the best.  I have a stationary recumbent bike.  If I ride about 2-3 times/week it helps me keep the pain down.  But exercise also ramps up my chronic fatigue so it's still the usual balancing act we all have to perform to try to keep our day-to-day lives vs our symptoms on an even keel.  I also have a dog who requires me to get him out for 3 short walks every day.  I was aware that the back/hip pain could be a feature of SJS but didn't know the term sacroiliitis.  It's a word that will probably come in handy at my next doctor visit..."
"Oh, I didn't mean take ibuprofen daily as treatment or preventative measure. I just take it as needed, which definitely and thankfully isn't every day or even once a week. I think you're right that too much is bad for the liver. I'm needle phobic so shots of anything are a last resort for me. Eek! Glad you were able to get some relief from it, though."
9 weeks! Still havea long time for baby to cook. 🤣
"My primary symptoms I went to see the doctor for before my Sjogren's diagnosis was joint pain in multiple sets of joints (especially knees and back). I can't recommend water exercise highly enough.  There's a local indoor pool that has water aerobics and water yoga classes, and they've been extremely beneficial for me."
Congrats anyhow! Enjoy the journey. I know I did when I was pregnant with my son (16 now).
"For me, all I really needed to do was eliminate processed sugar (desserts, candy, soda, cookies, sugary lattes you get the idea) and limit natural sugars like fruit. Reducing carbs also helps, and staying away from breads which end up turning into sugars inside the body."
I was AIP compliant for about six months. It was unfortunately not helpful for me.
"Definitely had a lot of success when I eliminated wheat, I also avoid nightshades, oats, coffee, just try to be sensible and concentrate on veggies, good fats, lean proteins. The Autoimmune Protocol is a great way to identify your triggers."
"Low to no carb, low to no sugar, high protein and increased water consumption = less joint pain, more energy and more stable mood for me."
i have been low or no sugar autoimmune paleo and Keto/paleo and I do much better off all grains and dairy. It does reduce symptoms but it was not a cure. I am going back and addressing gut issues now bc even on these diets if you have SIBO or Leaky Gut any food will eat no matter how healthy you a nasty immune response.

&#x200B;

I think some get lucky and eliminate gluten and its solves all their problems but for most of us its complicated. I do believe autoimmunity can be reversed fairly naturally but it can be like finding a needle in a hay stack for some of us and isnt always easy.

"There's one at my work. I've had back surgery so i'm not sure if I'm supposed to use it or not, but I did stand on it and do squats one day. Kinda interesting. the science looks good."

"Amazon has the same brand we have at work [for about $140](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Choice-Products-Vibration-Resistance/dp/B01FTCSTU6/ref=sr_1_35?ie=UTF8&qid=1538518381&sr=8-35&keywords=vibration+platform). I'd just spend a little time looking at reviews on amazon, really."
Thank you. :)
Can you tell me how a vibration machine relates to Sjogren's? I've never heard anything about this. TIA
"Well for me personally I’m in a lot of pain all over similar to fibromyalgia,but according to some of my other symptoms my doctors don’t believe it is,and I tend to have cold feet all the time even during summer. I’m hoping it’ll work similar to the hummingbird device they created to treat fibromyalgia pain (in my case it’s severe Primary Sjogrens pain, to the point I’m 26 and am on disability)"

"My doctor also recommended I get one to help with exercise and prevent bone loss (I’m on a high dose D protocol). I haven’t been able to buy one yet ,but I plan to before January hopefully. Hope this answered your question. :)"
"Thanks for the info. I'm sorry you're having so much pain :( I basically have muscle aches in my calves and forearms and take lots of hot baths, which is awful for my dry skin. If it's not one thing, it's another. And of course, dry eyes and mouth. This illness sucks."
have you been tested for Small fiber neuropathy? Many of us have that - they are now thinking many dx with Fibro are really developing neuropathy. Mine is all over. Need sudo motor test or punch skin biopsy.
What are your symptoms?
"Hi, sorry this is so long, this is what I am working on the for the dr visit.  I'm trying to keep it short but I don't want to leave anything out. I feel sort of like a hypochondriac and yet these symptoms are real.  I figure I'd send them the timeline over the years and discuss the details in person.   I'm afraid to add that I get brutal PMS because I don't want to be dismissed, but I wonder if SS is instigating PMS.  I plan to review my insurance claims history today with a rep from my insurance company to fill some timeline."

Dear Dr:

"I went for a nerve test for Carpel Tunnel and the Dr. said I do not have CP, and I should see a Rheumatologist. I find it hard to believe that I don't have CP.   I never would have tied my eye symptoms to any other symptoms. For the last few years, eye symptoms are dry eyes, gritty eyes, rash in outer corners, and my right eye tears a lot, uncontrollably, most mornings.   Also, I don't have a lot of saliva.  I can't muster up enough saliva for the 23&me dna test.  I occasionally have trouble swallowing and or after swallowing i have trouble moving my food along sometimes. "

Early symptoms that may be related:

"1981:  Compartment Exertion Syndrome.  both legs, even though I am not an athlete whatsoever.  Surgery in 1999 and 2009.  no improvement"

"Restless leg syndrome for as long as I could remember, age 10 or so.   Poor balance. I thought it was neuro, the neurologist said I was fine.   Now I think it is a balance issue due to numbness, not a dizzy issue.  fyi I do have vertigo, I don't have a good constitution for travel/movement. "

"1985:  The palms of my hands turned red when I got pregnant, and stayed red  - to this day. "

1989:  Mono and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  I only remember having 6 weeks of short term disability & Esgic for headaches. 

1999:  A vascular surgeon sewed up a tear in my fascia on my left leg.  That was the exact opposite of what needed to be done.

"2003:  IBS diagnosis.   I've had two colonoscopies that showed nothing going on.  Symptoms were/are:  constipation/diarrhea, pain (lower left) , random spasms (lower-mid left), thin stool, shredded/floating stool, vegetable skins, lettuce, sometimes I have to go to the bathroom all day/incomplete evacuation. oily spots floating in the toilet at times.    "

"2009:  March  left leg fasciotomy 3 compartments through an incision in my front leg, and muscle lengthening through an incision on the back of my leg, & also the Dr said he worked for 40 minutes to un-impinge a nerve.  I have neuropathy in my leg and left foot and toe.   2 painful episodes recently with my left foot."

"2012:  I went to the ER with pain in my left side.  They did a scan but said they didn't find anything.  When I followed up with my GP, she said the report showed inflammation and she gave me medicine."

"2016 In June:  parotid gland infection/salivary stone.  Urgent Care  gave me antibiotics and I had an ENT follow-up visit somewhere else for a check up.  The stone came out in January of 2018.  I get swollen glands sometimes, one side or both, no sore throat.  For as long as I can remember.  I had mumps around age 10. "

"2016 In  September: I had another scan for pain in my side, it showed nothing.  The dr said it's probably adhesions."

"2018:  Visit to Dr. for hand pain.  Referred to Dr. for nerve conductivity test.  Negative for Carpel Tunnel syndrome. Back to Dr., he gave me a referral for a scan with contrast, I did not get that yet. "

"2018: In April I was diagnosed  with evidence of a bleeding ulcer by Dr. .  No H.pylori and I rarely take nsaids. Dr. said even 1 nsaid can trigger an ulcer.  I don't believe that for me.  I took Prevacid for 3 weeks as recommended and it helped a lot but, the ulcer is not gone. it interferes with my range of motion and my stride. Lots of different foods bother me now.  I had 3 episodes of vomiting/dizziness.  The last one was very bad and so I went to the endo. Dr. to find I have an ulcer.  I pretty much went into pain, threw up and blacked out. So, doctor."


"2018: May 5th: Per Dr. , Neurologist, the nerve conductivity test  was negative for Carpel Tunnel Syndrome.  He asked a few questions, recommended seeing a Rheumatologist.   I went to my GP  Dr.  for bloodwork for RA, it was negative.  Dr.  recommended seeing a Rheumatologist anyway because I could be seronegative for RA. "

"2018 June 26  Second opinion with hand specialist Dr..  Small amount of arthritis in my left thumb per x-ray. Not convinced I have CP, he prescribed PT, I did not do it."

2018 July:  Left foot pain.  2 episodes.  very painful.  about 10 minutes per episode.  NOT bunion pain

&#x200B;

"I am experiencing symptoms in my **hands, eyes, stomach, skin, IBS, legs, shoulder and nerves as follows**: "

"**Hand Symptoms**:  Carpel Tunnel symptoms, a pins and needles feeling occurs in my hands and arms for many years now.  Now, pins and needles almost always precede a hot flash & sweating from menopause.  I do get hot flashes without first feeling pins and needles. "

"**Hand pain**: I went to Dr. S, he sent me to Dr. G for the nerve conductivity test. I have pain in the back of my hand, palm, fingers, wrist, wrist up to elbow.  Weak grip, poor strength especially in left hand. Cannot hold a pan, cannot support a plate or cereal bowl. Shock/zap when holding the railing on steps, wiping windows, folding clothes, driving, cutting potatoes, using a zipper.  Small amount of arthritis in my left thumb/wrist area per Dr. P / Ortho.   Snap/crack wrists to relieve pressure + Acupuncture for 3 months so far.  I have improvement in my hand. "

"**Leg Pain/Symptoms**:  Compartment Exertion Syndrome:  In both legs since I was about 15 years old, maybe younger. My left leg is worse than my right leg, even after surgeries.  Incorrect surgery in 1998, when a vascular dr sewed up a tear in my fascia instead of cutting the fascia open.  Left leg fasciotomy in 2010 (3 compartments) by an incision in the front of my leg, and muscle lengthening through an incision in the back of my leg  by Dr. B. Dr. B said he also worked 40 minutes to un-impinge a nerve.  Overall, the improvement is mild. Nerve damage along bone and onto the top of my foot, onto my big toe. Leg swelling daily, pain, spasms, ache, weakness, water retention, rubbery feel. "

"Just FYI:  I went to HSS before I went to Dr. B. Per the ""gold standard"" compartment pressure tests with those needles, I have CES.  I had the test twice, and each test was 12 needles.   But, HSS said I did not have CES because I was missing the ""history of endurance athlete/sports"".  "

"Yeah, I can see why you would be concerned that a doctor would not diagnosing you with Sjogren's. Primary symptoms are ocular and oral dryness, and various other symptoms could go along with it, plus applicable labs results. No applicable lab results and your list is mostly symptoms that are not dryness so that could be tough. A rheumatologist can't gauge dryness, though other specialists can."

Maybe get confirmation of dryness elsewhere and ask rheumy about the Sjogren's early detection test? Your rheumy may suggest getting salivary gland biopsy if your labs remain negative.
"I'm wondering if it's RA with secondary Sjogren's.  I will ask about the early detection test, I didn't know about that. I prefer to have nothing wrong. I don't take any medication on a daily basis and would like to keep it that way. But something is going on: dry eyes, low saliva, salivary stone, poor swallowing  ulcer, IBS etc. issues can be related to lack of moisture.  I have an appointment with the eye doctor in November for Sjogren's testing."

"Hello again, I went to the dr today. She gave me an order for an extensive blood - test 8 vials.  She said if nothing shows up on this test, then I do not have any autoimmune disorders.  I asked about sero-negative RA and she does not believe in it.  She said ""What would I treat if there is no disease?"
Did you get test results yet? I thought RA is determined by x-ray images were used to detect RA.
"Hi, thanks for checking in. My blood work was all clear.  I went to 2 different Rheumatologists, the 2nd had a better bedside manner by 100%.  He sent me for thyroid and vitamin D blood work today.  I still do not know what the cause of my hand pain is, or other joint pain, or dryness.  He said he can't prescribe anything for me, and I said I don't want any prescription, I just want to know what is going on. Made me wonder if rheumy #1 thought I was trying to get pain pills.   Getting to the bottom of health issues is exhausting and demoralizing to me.  Thanks again for checking."
I know this is an old post. Just wondering if you ever received a diagnosis. I too have a lot of odd things going on. I have an upcoming rheum. appt. I just can’t tell if my symptoms are anxiety related or actual autoimmune..
"My doc believes I have this. My main symptom is chronic calcium phosphate kidney stones. However, uro said that there is no point in actually testing for it because you can't do much about it, although I don't know if that is true. I have read some correlations between those with SS and parathyroid problems tying into kidney stone issues. Do you get stones?"
I have it and I don’t know what’s next. Waiting on test results to plan treatment. I do have issues with stones and very low potassium.
"Not that I'm aware of, but I have had some extreme pain and suspected a few times but I hate doctors.  The treatment for RTA is baking soda. I've been doing baking soda pills for 3 days and a lot of symptoms are disappearing. I do about 2 tbsp a day. When I feel the kidney pain flare at all, I take another pill. Literally I opened a box of arm and hammer and bought some 000 capsules and fill them."
Does this mess with your sodium levels? I have read that baking soda in high amounts can be dangerous. But I suppose anything can be.
"So far, no. But I tend to be on the low side of electrolytes so I'm not really concerned."
I'm 26.. Constant memory issues!
"I thought I just failed at life/memories. It's weird how invasive this is, when it's mostly characterized by ""dry eyes and mouth""."
"Definite memory issues. When I wake up in the morning, not only are my joints swollen but I honestly feel like my brain is physically swollen as well. After the ibuprofen kicks in, the joint swelling goes down and the feeling of swollen brain does, too. I worry about how ""stupid "" I am when it's swollen: can't finish sentences, find words, do simple tasks and if it will cause permanent brain issues as it continues."
"I’ve rationalized my memory problems thus far to middle age, Gabapentin, and other meds.  Mainly the the meds."
"Heh, I forgot the ""a"" \^"
I wish doctors would do more than ask us to dx our own dry eyes and mouth.  I had no idea I had dry eyes or dry mouth for 25 years.
"Yeah, this is my biggest worry, but my rheumatologist doesn't seem interested. She does want me to take a test to check for cognitive decline. But I've had it pretty badly on and off since I was bout 28 (30 years). She is listing me as non-extraglandular involvement, which I know isn't true. All the nerve stuff has been signficant. I'm pretty sure there is small-fiber neuropathy, but I need to schedule that test."

"Look into a humidifier, it may help. Biotin mouth wash helps me as well."
"I started using a nose cone and it allows me to sleep through the night no problem. It's a little plastic thing you put into your nostrils opening them up so you can breathe, it even works for me when I'm stuffed up. Any pharmacy should sell them. I lie on my back as I'm falling asleep and concentrate on breathing through my nose. I wake up without dry mouth and don't have to use any products on my mouth before bed anymore."
"I would not be able to sleep without an AC. While it does lower humidity levels, keeping my bedroom in the 60s allows me to breathe much easier through my nose."

"Have you tried Neutrasal? I have zero saliva production, so products like Biotene are useless. Using something like Neutrasal will help a bit with dryness and provides some relief."
"Ugh, the dry mouth has DEFINITELY been worse lately for me as well."

"I have a bathroom in my bedroom too, but I don’t use the shower in there because the room is already too warm and those lovely hot flashes made it unbearable."

"I do have a small humidifier near the bed to help with the dryness, and my eye doc told me to do warm to the hottest I can stand wet compresses on my eyes twice a day. He said it will help with... something about getting oil production going which also helps with lubrication... something something. Whatever it is, it plus Xiidra helps."
"I've thought of an humidifier. Thing is I have a bathroom in my bedroom...So it's already more humid than your average bedroom. I'm scared it'll cause mold, which I'm allergic to."
Thank you for the recommendation! I'm going to try that. :)
"I haven't tried Neutrasal. I am not sure it's a thing in Europe, I should ask my doctor."

"I know...the heat is terrible for breathing. Seems like my ideal temperature is 68°F/20°C.   For now I just have a fan in my bedroom, which is not helping at all. Do you use a humidifier along with the AC?"
"Ah yes, the warm compresses also help me. I infuse a chamomile tea bag in hot water, let it cool down, and let the compresses soak in it. It's pretty nice!"
"Oh yeah that  may be a problem. I’ve been looking into getting one myself because my Sjogrens is so bad. I have the same problems as you with the dry mouth. I was diagnosed seven years ago, and since then have lost my smell completely because of dry sinuses and go through a bottle of eye drops a week. It’s an awful disease. I wish I could be more help. I know there is medication available for it, have you tried any?"
"No, I don't, but it would probably be a good idea to do so. My clock has a humidity reading and it's generally around 50% during the summer with the AC running. My rheumatologist told me that 55-65% is ideal."
"That sounds horrible, this illness is hell! :(  Do you also suffer from acid reflux? I'm taking Nexium for it, and I suspect it makes my dry mouth worse."

"I also use a bottle of eye drop a week! In fact, it started with my eyes. It took me 8 months to find the right drops...as most created irritation."

"Now my nose and genitals are affected as well, and I went from oily skin to dry skin."

"For my intimates, I use a special cleaning gel and lotion and it seems under control. I've started using Bioderma's cleansing oil instead of soap, and it also helps okay. I use petroleum jelly in my nose, it's apparently not so good but I don't really have a choice (I find that salty nasal rinses make my nose drier). I had to give up oxygen for my chronic migraines, as well as my triptan spray, and antihistamine treatments. It's especially tough to treat many conditions at the same time. I was referred to the internal medicine department in my hospital, so I hope they will help. Sigh."

"I've tried mouth sprays but they're not really solving the issues. As I am dealing with chronic stomach issue, my doctor said the salivary complements would probably worsen the pain so he didn't prescribe any...so I drink 4L of water every day. The dry mouth is more of a problem at night and during meals."







"I thought the AC would get the humidity level lower than that! I should probably get an hygrometer, just to see how different humidity levels affect my dryness."
The humidity levels here in Wisconsin can be pretty intense. It's currently 80% humidity outdoors. I wish that I could say that I noticed a difference on days like today.
Sauna decreases inflammation? I have read the exact opposite when it comes to autoimmune disorders. I haven’t been able to go to a sauna in about five years because it will make all my symptoms SO much worse.

Juicing with the right ingredients is always a good choice though. :)
"1. I've never been a fan of dry saunas. But I've used steam rooms and hot tubs for limited amounts of time without any issues. 15 minutes tops, after working out."
2. Hate juicing. I have IBS. The high FODMAP content in a lot of fruits and vegetables would set off an IBS flare up and the extra stress on my system would set off a Sjogren's  flare up within 24 hours. After a few juice fasts I made the connection.
"I think sauna causes an increase in immune function, which is the opposite of what we want.  I did find this statement.  ""Interestingly, for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, pain and inflammation have found to be increased on the day after taking a sauna – unless the sauna bath is followed by a cold immersion. For patients with arthritis that use cold-water bathing after sauna, there can be an overall improvement in symptoms."" http://www.saunasociety.org/press-releases/2015/10/18/health-benefits-of-sauna"

"i have read a lot about sauna being anti inflammatory but perhaps it doesnt work for those with AI. Makes sense, will maybe skip that next week."
Yeah! Probably sauna is all about relaxation and detoxing if you are a person whose immune system is not constantly attacking you without any reason whatsoever😆
thats a good point that i was completely ignorant to haha
"For me, I’ll usually start by making sure I’m hydrated. I’ll drink a couple waters then lie with a warm compress on my jaw for about an hour. A lot of times my swelling is caused by (spit stones? That’s what I call them...)  so then I’ll gargle warm salt water and bite a lime wedge- an oral surgeon recommended lemonheads but I find just a chunk of lime is more effective. It’s incredibly painful but it takes care of the issue. Best of luck to you."
"I just had mine do this for the first time! Warm compresses helped as do Brach's lemon drops. those things are horribly sour, but make those salivary glands in there twitch."
Sour lemon drops really help
"I do increased hydration + warm compresses + Sour Patch Kids candy. But when the swelling gets really bad, I need a short course of prednisone from my ENT to get rid of it."
Well I’m off to a good start because I already decided I would increase my water intake today to help. I was thinking of trying a hot compress so I will do that once I get home.

Biting a piece of lime sounds so incredibly painful!!! But I think it’ll help - definitely worth a painful try.

Thank you for your great suggestions.
Thank you for your suggestions. I’ll try the warm compress once I’m home from work and I will have to get some lemons or limes to bite down on. Sounds awful but it makes the glands twitch indeed!
"There's an OTC 50,000 IU Vitamin D, you can get it as an rx but I've seen it  in grocery stores. As far as I know the only reason to worry about the source of vitamin D is if you have certain allergies, especially fish/shellfish, since that's where most of it comes from."
"This is such an eerie post to read. I took accutane for about 6 months when i was 16/17. Have had dry eyes and mouth for some time, also had nonbacterial prostatitis and got my urethra dilated during a cystoscopy that showed no cause for my pain. My main problem now is just generalised pain in my joints and autonomic dysfunction i.e dry mouth , eyes, orthostatic intolerance, nausea and a whole load of other personal things. Turns out I have Ehlers-Danlos which is believed to be the main contributor (accutane likely contributes to my dry mouth and eyes) to these things. Do you have stretchy skin and are you particularly flexible?"
If you're concerned you might have Sjogren's it's definitely a good idea to get it checked out. I didn't even know Sjogren's existed and didn't realize my eyes or mouth were that dry. I went to a rheumatologist for something else and we found it.
"No, I've never been very flexible! I never could touch my toes in PE, ha!"

Have you tried saw palmetto?
"It's also possible to have EDS and Sjogren's - I have both. We found my Sjogren's when I went to the rheumatologist for EDS. She said she didn't know anything about EDS but that she wanted to test me for Sjogren's - and after a lip biopsy, yep, confirmed."
"""Particularly flexible"" isn't referring to touching toes or PE athleticism. Here's a video that demonstrates EDS flexibility. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b26GLWkd7sc"
"Ask her doctor to run an ""early sjogrens"" blood test.  It is more sensitive, and can detect the disease earlier in the process.  I was negative on everything until this test.  I think it is only done by one lab in the US."
"Done! Just a note, it doesn’t let you choose multiple autoimmune diseases. I have multiple and added the extras in the other. That might be important to the research."
I took the survey. The only change I would suggest is allowing multiple illnesses. I have 2 of the listed plus 2 AI's not listed.
"Done and done. I echo the comments above, many of us have dual autoimmune diagnoses, perhaps even more than 2-3. However I understand it may not be info particularly needed for your study at this time."
Best wishes in your research-it is much needed on this subject

Edit: Question-do you mind if I share link to survey on Twitter?

"Pretty good, although humidity is out for me- my asthma is waaaay worse in humid environments. I'll ask my doctor for medications."
[deleted]
"Yes, it happens occasionally. Try gently massaging the area."
"I have primary sjogrens and have dealt with periodic parotid swelling for years.  Normally some Advil, massage and time take care of it just fine, but last fall I had my right gland swell up to the size of a golf ball and it just wouldn’t go down. It moved my jaw out of place and eventually caused so much pain I couldn’t swallow. Ended up being a really nasty infection that required several rounds of antibiotics. Watch for redness, severe pain and pus in your mouth when you push on the gland. After 2 rounds of augmenten and doxy, it finally cleared up for me. I was told by my ENT and rheumatologist that this isn’t unusual for sjogrens since it attacks the salivary glands. Good luck!"
[deleted]
"Wow, thanks for the info."
"I put warm washcloths on it and did the massaging. It's gone down quite a bit this morning, but is still a bit tender and swollen. Thanks for responding!"
"I've been on methotrexate, arava, Enbrel, humira, some other pill very briefly, actemra, Xeljanz, and I had my first round of rituxin in January for the RA. I was put on Xiidra fro the dry eye, and it definitely helps, but I only remember to take it once a day."

"I had the most amazing doctor, but she and 5 other doctors left the practice, and my insurance doesn't cover her new one. Supposedly, my new one is great, but I won't know til I meet with her in a couple of weeks."

"The gland has, thankfully, gone down almost completely. Looking like a rabid chipmunk on one side was NOT a good look for me!"
Is it any better? Have any questions?  I'm kinda a pro at this life.
"I also take Advil or another NSAID. It'll probably go away in a day or two. Also, maybe an ice pack for a few minutes off and on may help. You'll figure out what works best for you."
[deleted]
"Thanks so much! I'm hoping for good response. I had a week with Enbrel in March of 2016 that was so good I thought I was getting better. I felt it ebbing away, and had a strong grief reaction. My insurance has gone up to $950 a month, but it covers everything, so I'm trying to see it as a bargain ;)"
"I have Sjogrens and know about skincare, so maybe I can help. Can you let me know what your skincare and makeup routine is already? What’s your budget?"

"I have dry skin as well because of Sjogrens. I use a hydrating cleanser (Cerave) and Clinique gel moisturizer. Chemical exfoliating helps my skin so much. My favorite is the Paulas Choice 2% BHA, and use that three days a week. Using a hydrating facial spray helps as well. I like rose water, there are a few on Amazon. I use this in my skincare routine, before and after makeup, and anytime else throughout the day. As far as a makeup primer, I like Too Faced Hangover RX primer. My favorite foundation for my dry skin is It Cosmetics CC+ cream, it makes my skin look and feel amazing!"
"Cerave is the only skincare product I’ve found that works reasonably well, and then I usually just wear amore pacific during the day because it’s such good sun protection but i seem to be getting dryer lately. I haven’t really explored masks yet, that’s a good place to start maybe."
Thanks I’ll give chemical exfoliating a try
"I know, I know, stupid multi level marketing, but Ronan and Fields Soothe line cleared up all the weird flakiness without causing breakouts or oiliness."
"Cetaphil or Cerave, as others have said. Basically skincare products with ceramides are your friends. Unfortunately, the more expensive the product the higher the ceramide concentration."

"I've noticed that if I use a good night cream, currently using Cosrx Honey Ceremide, I can use a drugstore SPF day moisturizer, primer and foundation during the day without any issues."
Look for a glowy or dewey foundation vs. matte which may cling to flakes. I use Cerave and Cetaphil products are really nice. Load up on moisturizer under your primer and let it dry.

For primers again I would stay away from anything matte. I really like Loreal infallible pro glo foundation applied with damp beauty blender sponge for healthy glow unless you're super oily which might not be the best choice.
ohhh I've been wanting to try the IT cosmetics CC cream!!!!
The cc cream is great for redness! Only foundation I’ve used that covers the redness but doesn’t look caked on. I’m super fair skinned also.
"Dry mouth which led to abnormal amounts of cavities despite taking care of my teeth, dry private parts (TMI...but hope to help others), and chronic fatigue that was inescapable, despite enough rest, good diet etc."
"To be honest, not a whole lot. I was so used to having ""allergies"" that I figured I was dry everywhere else because of the antihistamines. When my Rheumatologist told me all the pain and fatigue I'd been having were cause by dry eyes and mouth, I wanted to punch him."
"I had other autoimmune illnesses, so I kept thinking with the resolution of celiac disease, then AI thyroid disease that I'd start feeling stronger and get more energy. Nope!!"
"I don't think it's that dry eyes and mouth cause the fatigue. It's more that Sjogren's causes dry eyes, dry mouth and awful fatigue as well as can attack nerves and brain, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart. Oh, it's a fun ride, ain't it??  If you have a systemic autoimmune disease like Sjogren's, your body is wasting a ton of energy attacking it's own tissue. Then it must crank up cellular regeneration to make more cells in order to replace damaged tissue. Think of how much energy you use to fight an invading bacteria or virus. You become exhausted from the effort; you get the flu, you can't leave your bed. Now imagine expending the energy not only to repair damage, but to create the damage in the first place. You're tired because you really are physically exhausted."
"In my case the lip area felt  a bit weird for the rest of the day. This was due to the anaesthetic, not the actual biopsy. Get ready for some drooling the first couple of hours ;)  Use a straw to drink and avoid tea or coffee until you can feel your face again. Good luck!"
Yeah hurt a bit afterwards for me but procedure not bad at all. It was worth it.
Thanks!  I don't care if I'm swollen for just a week.  It sounds like you recovered pretty freaking fast
"Thanks, for peace of mind, definitely.... I've had some rough surgeries so I think I can deal with us"
"Yeah, if it's anything like my biopsy was you'll be fine in no time. Would you like me to explain the procedure or would you prefer for it to be a surprise? =D"
Let me get back to you on that. I was wondering how I should mentally prepare because I hate blood a lot. It makes me dizzy lol
"You didn't have to take antibiotics afterwards, right? They jack up my stomach"
"No antibiotics, minimal blood, done in ten minutes. Let me know if you need any specifics =)"
"Thank God no antibiotics, do you see them pulling out the tissue?  Eep"
"They take the sample from the inside of your lip, so you can't really see what's happening. It's a lot like a having a tooth filled: you can see the doctor's hands moving and see some equipment being brought to your mouth, but you have no idea what they're doing. Also, no one will blame you for closing your eyes!!"
"That's good, I feel a lot better about this. Thank you"
Glad to help ^^
I've tried both I prefer cevemiline (evoxac) as you don't have to take it as often as pilocarpine (salagen) it has helped me tremendously with keeping my mouth moist and I wake up alot less often with cotton dry mouth. Now it happens once or twice a month instead of every day.
"Evoxac works for me so I haven't tried Salagen. I take it at 5 hour intervals and it takes about 30-45 minutes to notice extra saliva production. Really good for sleeping through the night without having to wake up for water, and also no more sore throat in the morning. The only negative side effect I had was nausea the first time I took it without enough water. A positive side effect is it also helps produce tears for my dry eyes. Some people report excess sweating with Evoxac or Salagen."

I think dental health definitely improves because saliva cleans. I also get fluoride treatment at the dentist's office after each 6 month cleaning.
I haven’t tried either. I once chatted with my rheumy about it he said they don’t have a high success rate. I would still be interested in trying it. I look forward to see what other people’s experiences have been with both of these.
I take Evoxac. It helps a little. Salagen made my heart race.
"I started with Evoxac, but it worsened my nausea. I now take salagen, but it rarely works for me due to the severity of my case of Sjögren's Syndrome. People seem to do well on them overall."
Very excited to start this soon! Maybe now I will be able to swallow food without nearly choking to death. Thanks for the input everyone!
"Possibly, but the areas you mentioned not where saliva is produced. https://www.google.com/search?q=salivary+glands+location&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=emqa7TOwEIHCtM%253A%252CozLiMFTA_jrq-M%252C_&usg=__M4aLcw0JdXhf3wKDNRO8j4D3fCo%3D&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwist6ehqt3YAhUhSN8KHbrADXcQ9QEIcDAR#imgrc=emqa7TOwEIHCtM:"

"If you are on any medication, check to see if side effects include dry mouth. If not, ask your doctor to check blood for Sjogren's and anything else he or she thinks the issue could be. https://labtestsonline.org/conditions/sjogren-syndrome"
Also check if you have food sensitivities.
I know it works well but can have some nasty side effects. I
expressed concern about MTX and was put on Imuran. I have never had so many weeks in a row where I felt so great. Could be worth asking.
OK thanks
"Sorry to hear about your recent cancer diagnosis and muscle pain. I use magnesium glycinate to reduce or eliminate muscle pain caused by SS, lupus or life. One 400 mg tablet in the morning and another in the evening. Kal and Doctor's Best are both good brands."
+1 on the magnesium. Maybe look into tumeric/curcumin as well. I've had mixed but promising results.

"Also talk to your doctor about muscle relaxers (flexeril, zanaflex, baclophen) and gabapentin. I had bad side effects and not much relief myself (I've tried everything I mentioned), but its worth looking into. At lower doses, they can be pretty tolerable and effective for a lot of people with this kind of pain."
"Cutting down on lactose helped my muscle pain. I also take magnesium, vitamin D, B12, and fish oil pills.Not sure if this actually helps but it might be worth a shot."
Good luck!
"You may also want to check out Bromelain. A surgeon included it in my post-op instruction for muscle pain/healing after a minor surgery, I thought it was pretty effective."
Thank you! I'll look into that!
"Gabapentin made me loopy lol, I didn't think about muscle relaxers, duh me. Thank you for your ideas."
"Thank you. I do take vitamin D and B complex. I can try fish oil after my cancer surgery, not allowed before surgeon said. Lactose...hmmm, that's very interesting, I love dairy :/ sigh"
I will....muscle pain is a big issue! Thank you
"I have the same thing... you might want to see an endocrinologist.  I was diagnosed with Sjogrens, Hashimotos, and thyroid cancer.  My cancer causes pain in specific areas, so does my hashimotos. Meaning,  ear hurts,  throat sore, neck hurts,  headache, facial muscles... long list"
Anyone?   Anyone?
Thanks.

Why?
Because ENTs can evaluate and treat issues with parotid glands. http://www.entnet.org/content/salivary-glands
OK did not know that.
"I would look into the early sjogrens blood panel. I have multiple antibodies on the early panel, which is not the diagnostic criteria for sjogrens at the moment, but will likely be in the near future because the current blood test doesn't catch it until you've had it for a long time and biopsies can be false negatives"
"I'm sorry. I mean as someone who's Sjogren's is attacking organs I'm glad you most likely don't have it, but I also know all too well the frustration of being sick and not knowing what the hell is going on. It might be worth considering a second opinion from a Sjogren's specialist if you haven't had one already just to confirm everything. Do your doctor(s) have any other possible ideas for what you might have?"
Saw the rheumatologist yesterday. She said that Sjogrens is still very likely because of my symptoms and presentation etc. Plaquenil is helping me a lot and it shows in my bloodwork too. My inflammation was right down at almost normal levels for the first time since I got sick. Which is wonderful!
"Yes, my doc did the early SS panel, and it came back positive.  All the other tests were negative.  Only a few labs in the country do this test. Also, my insurance company (Aetna) denied the claim for paying the $645 for the test, claiming it was ""experimental."""
"Yeah that's totally it. Woohoo to not having a systemic inflammatory disease, boo to still not knowing WTF is going on. I currently see 2 rheumatologists (saw the 2nd one because I wasn't happy with how things were moving with the 1st one) and they seem to think it could be fibromyalgia as well. Though my high inflammatory markers are not explained by that. I was sent for a bone scan the other day which I think is to rule out CRPS and rheumatoid arthritis. They all seem to agree there is certainly an issue that needs to be diagnosed. Which is good!"
I've had a few docs that tried to tell me it was all in my head so I'm glad your doctors are taking you seriously.

I also have fibromyalgia as well. It was actually diagnosed first in me. The Sjogren's was diagnosed when I went to get a second opinion just to confirm the first doctor's fibro diagnosis. It's why I always suggest second opinions.




"I had one last year tell me I was fine and to go home and not worry, that my high ESR and CRP were normal and that my muscle tone is poor and that's why I'm in pain. TBH I cried for days after that for a variety of reasons. Complaining to the hospital (eventually) about that, and seeking the care of another doctor was the one of the most empowering things I've ever done for myself. I'm glad you got your diagnoses in the end, and you're so right about second opinions. We have to keep fighting."
"I have absolutely zero tolerance for doctors who do not take patient's concerns seriously. I can handle a misdiagnosis because well, medicine is hard. I also completely understand when they are just as flummoxed as I am. I even get that some patients are attention seekers or hypochondriacs and actually don't have anything wrong with them. However, to be dismissive right off the bat just pisses me off like nothing else does."

"I'm glad you found your inner warrior to officially complain about that doctor's behavior. It's great you found the courage to stand up for yourself, but unfortunate that your concerns were brushed off like that."
"Just want to chime in here - even if her typical inflammatory markers (ANA, sed rate) aren't positive, don't let her get discouraged or written off. None of my typical markers were high so I didn't see a rheumatologist or anything, and lo and behold 3 years later I see an immunologist who runs the early Sjogren's panel and my labs were sky high despite negative ANA and such. Also, note there is an early Sjogren's panel that is different than the SSA /SSB tests. I still don't get positive SSA/SSB labs but my immunologist thinks it will just be a matter of time before I do so we are starting on Plaquenil."
"A regular PCP can order autoimmune labs, which could be a good start and give you more insight into what could be going on without jumping straight to a specialist and paying extra. If something comes up positive, they can refer you, but if not, they can run more tests and try to find any other cause for the symptoms."
Yes a rheum would do further testing for sjrogrens or any other possible autoimmune. So she would need to be referred by her PCP.
"What do you mean by ""early sjorgren's panel""? Could you provide any more details?"
Thanks for replying. Any other suggestions? Do they do a blood test right away or are there other test they do first?
I need to do a post about it on my website. There's so much to know and it's so important people are looking at the early Sjogren's tests if they suspect it! Sorry - just passionate about it after suffering 3.5 years without answers. If you scroll down to the bottom of this [blog post](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/blog/wordpress/early-sjogrens-antibodies-in-dysautonomia-patients/)  it goes into early Sjogren's panel a bit.

"I'm going to do a more specific post on my own website (navigatingchronicillness.com) soon that goes into more details specifically just for early Sjogren's, which tests to order and where to get them (I got mine at labcorp, my immunologist ordered them.) I'll try to reply to my comment again with a link when my post is up!"
"No problem, her primary can run a test called an ANA(anti-nuclear antibodies) test that will check for inflammation, if her titers come back abnormal then thats more cause to send her to the rheumatologist."

"Having a list of symptoms also helps the doctor find which may suit her best, if she is having just eye problems and no high ANA the doc may refer her to an ophthalmologist."

Sjogrens along with other auto-immune diseases mimic each other and takes a while for diagnosis for a lot of people. I found I had high ANA so was sent to rheum who I saw for two years before being put on medication to help my immune system slow down a bit.

A specific blood test called an SSA-SSB is for Sjogrens the rheumatologist will run several tests on her blood including this test and physically examine her and ask about symptoms etc.

"Best of luck to you both, its not fun having these problems, good she has someone who cares."

"Edit: also everyone is different so how an autoimmune displays in one person may be different than someone else who has the same, me for instance, my blood tests positive for Sjogrens but my symptoms display more like SLE usually same protocol on how its treated but shows that docs rely more on how the person looks and feels physically than blood tests."
"No, I'm not on any medications for my fibro. I'm sure no medications are causing the constipation dry like symptoms. The eyes are very dry though. My mouth is starting to get more dry too. My face is also going numb a lot and I'm getting a sharp pain in my throat. I'm reading that face going number or burning and throat pain like this is caused by a nerve in sjogrens. Face numbness is also common with Fibromyalgia in many people. If there were any way to fix this it would be if my immune system is reacting to nickle from the dental implant I had and i would need to chelate the nickel away and hope after time my immune system stops reacting this way. It would be the lymphocytes doing this as they react to nickle."
"My wife has Sjogren's  - positive for the antibodies, although those are overly general so don't mean much.  She has had a lot of the same symptoms as you, and she's found relief from the following:"

Nordic Naturals DHA Extra Fish Oil Pills (use this exact one; we tried a lot).  She takes 1-2 day; you may find relief from more.  That should help a lot with oral/rectal/vaginal dryness.

"Berberine 1-2g day; started around a month ago.  Not sure if it's safe beyond 8-10 weeks due to cytochrome alterations, but that led to a huge improvement in GI tract problems, memory and brain fog issues, and overall mood.  Berberine alters MMP9, IL-6, tnf-a, IL-17, gut bacteria, and host of other inflammatory cascades.  We're taking Dr. Whitakers, which was well reviewed.  Vitamin C helps absorption, and blocks ROS and iKKa/b cascades, so make sure you're drinking some OJ or taking C supplements."

"Beyond that I would recommend exercise and sunlight for vitamin D, but especially exercise seems to help."

"My theory (I have no medical training but have been reading as much medical literature as possible for the last few years) is it is caused by oral bacteria (in your case from retainer, in her case from enamel defect in teeth causing cavities) which disregulates the immune system, causing dryness which allows the pathogens easier penetration of oral tissues."

Hope this helps!
I think what I have is mast cell activation syndrome. I’m going to see a specialist for it soon.
"I am a 26-year-old female with Sjogren's. When I cut out gluten completely and avoid high amounts of dairy & sugar, my symptoms (rash, inflammation, fatigue) are dramatically reduced. I also take Turmeric capsules daily to help with swelling in joints and general inflammation and it has helped me so much. There is a Turmeric drink here that I take from Whole Foods (in US) and it has done wonders for me, especially when I am very swollen."

Diet and managing inflammation is the most important thing you can do with this disease.
What are the main symptoms for which you are considering supplements?
"Joint pain mainly, I'd seen recommendations for curcumin and cbd oil & wondered if anyone had tried them :-)"
"Interesting to know, thanks people. No doubt I'll be back another time to pick your brains :-)"
"Back from doctor and given systane drops, an ointment and put on plaquenil. Not much advice given so going through the leaflets. How soon do you notice any improvement with the plaquenil for pain ?"
"Low or no sugar diet helps reduce my joint pain. I also take Life Extension brand Super Bio Curcumin (one in a.m. and another in p.m.) which helps prevent or alleviate joint pain. I just got NatureWise Curcumin to try when my LE runs out as the former gets really good reviews on Amazon, particularly from AI people, and is less expensive than the latter. I haven't tried cbd oil but some people have good experience with it. A good night's sleep also helps a lot."
Also diet ? I've read about auto immune diets and wonder if people have noticed any difference
"I got improvement within a couple of weeks, but it can take 3 months to get full effect of med."
Definitely worth trying an elimination diet. Eliminate one category of food at a time for 1-3 weeks each; keep a daily log to see if you notice any difference in symptoms.
"I don't know about hot water bottles, but I love Bed Buddy products. They are rice filled cloth bags that you heat in the microwave for no more than 2 minutes. Based on the concept, you can make your own if you want. My friend filled an old tube sock with rice and tied the open end. Done!"
That sounds doable! Thanks for the advice =3
If you don't get any traction here maybe try r/skincareaddiction
"My skin is dry enough to crack badly and peel off horribly although it's the itchy skin that damn near drives me mad. So I have to make sure to use pretty intensive moisturizers which, once I started doing that, my acne improved. I'm not sure if the acne was aggravated by the peeling skin or if the super dry skin just made it easier for bacteria to get into the pores though. Always possible that the added moisturizing had nothing to do with my reduction of acne."


"I actually got that  -after- being put on minocycline, an antibiotic, and I had a really bad reaction to it.  Was the flakey chin thing happening prior before the antibiotics?"
Is it possible the Benzoyl Peroxide is causing the dryness?  Whenever I use it my face turns red and burns and peels for days.
"The only way to know for sure, is to see a doctor. Sjogren's"
"can definitely affect intercourse though. Excessive dryness is, of course, one of the more common problems, but Sjogren's can cause other problems with sex including pain and other issues."

"Female related intercourse problems with Sjogren's are a bit better known. If you're a women, [this fact sheet](http://www.sjogrens.org/files/brochures/SexandSjogrens.pdf) might help."

"If you're a man, there isn't a lot out of info out there. Most studies tend to focus on women, but men could have problems as well. A doctor could rule out some possible issues and perhaps find a treatment that would help."


"I have this issue myself.  Not for sure if I have Sjogren's, RA, or if it is just another manifestation of my fibromyalgia (can't afford any more tests), but I think it is the chronic dryness that causes a lot of the discomfort.  The tissue in always moist areas of the body is very soft (tender), and it gets damaged much much easier when dry.  For example. if I don't chew some xylitol gum, and then put a ton of oral gel in my mouth before bed, I wake up with my tongue raw and swollen."
I've had chronic vaginal pain for years that I'm now thinking is linked to dryness. My diagnosis is still unknown but my doctor gave me some samples of Repagyn. I can't recommend looking in to it enough. After a couple weeks I've really noticed a difference. I wish I'd known about this product a long time ago. I live in Canada and have to purchase it at the pharmacy counter.
"yep.  use coconut oil.  sjogrens affects lubrication in the vagina.  I've had horrible luck and pain with other water based and silicone based lubes.  Try organic coconut oil.  Once you go coconut oil, you never go back ;)  have fun!"

I had problems. Bad. I was using vagicaine just to get past the pain to the pleasure. I got some HRT from the doc and got a bit more moisture in my labia but still pain.
"I started washing both of us beforehand with just a wet, warm towel. And, I use coconut oil as a lubricant. And that seemed to do it. I don't know if bacteria was irritating me because I'm already a bit dry but, yeah, all better now."
Can't hurt to try it.
"I've seen a few doctors and they aren't sure. I had very low testosterone so I took dhea to increase my levels, but still no change. The cause may be a mix of emotional and sjogrens"
"Have you tried evoxac (generic is cevimeline) or salagen (generic is pilocarpine) prescription saliva producing medication? It can make a world of difference, especially overnight night. Sleeping with humidifier near bed also helps."
Is it an ointment? What changes have you noticed and are there any side effects?
Thank you for your response. May I ask if there's a particular coconut oil that you recommend using?
Guy here - I have peripheral neuropathy associated with Sjogren's and it definitely makes things painful and dysfunctional. Then the psychological aspect took over to complete the soul crushing cycle.
"That could easily be the case - emotional issues and Sjogrens. If you take any medications, those could also be making things worse. My libido completely died for a few years because of some meds. But, there are things you can do. There are quite a few OTC and prescriptions that can treat some of the symptoms depending on your specific problems."

"RepaGyn is a non-hormonal vaginal moisturizing suppository available in Canada. If you're in the US, you could try Replens. The main difference between the two is RepaGyn actually helps to heal the vaginal lining whereas Replens does not. There are also estrogen creams that are very helpful to some women, but those require a prescription."
"I love my humidifier, but I am definitely asking my doctor about those!  I would really enjoy not having my tongue feel like a mix of pulled muscle, sunburn, and road rash.  Not to mention I would like to keep my teeth in my face where they belong.  Thank you!"
It's a non prescription vaginal suppository. You put it in at night. It has hyaluronic acid in it which helps draw moisture in to your tissues. It's hormone free so it's a pretty safe option. Make sure to double check that you arnt sensitive to any of the ingredients but so far the only side effect I've noticed is it makes you smell like tea tree oil. I've noticed that I have alot less sensitivity and am generally a great deal more comfortable down there. I've been able to have sex and masturbate with out discomfort during/after which is practically unheard of for me in the last few years. Ive tried other options like replens with no success. Here is the link to the Canadian website.

"I buy the big tub of organic coconut oil from Costco :). I use it for oil pulling, coffee, cooking and even cleaning my pipe lol. Very versatile stuff."
Intercourse is painful for you as well? I don't think I'm familiar with peripheral neuropathy...what is that exactly? Thank you for your response :)
"Thank you, I'll take a look at Replens :)"
Thank you so much for your response :)
"Yes it can be so painful I don't want to touch myself at all, then sometimes I can't feel much of anything...which is usually the case.  Not being able to feel contributes to ED and and all the Viagra in the world won't help that.  Sometimes Sjogren's can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS is basically all the nervous system outside of the brain and spine.   It affects breathing, sweating, taste, touch, movement, etc.  I get numbness, tingling, burning, and other sensations.  Sometimes all at the same time.  Gabapentin helps some, but not much for me.  I've reacted to Lyrica and Cymbalta so it's my only option.  Other things make dry mouth much worse.  I have fibromyalgia and Sjogren's diagnosis, though personally I think it's all SS related.  There's not much data on men with SS."
"I actually have a somewhat uncomfortable question. When I do have intercourse, my vagina naturally gets very wet...but I feel pain during the beginning then I feel absolutely nothing, no pleasure whatsoever. Would this still be considered a moisture problem? Do most people with vaginal dryness never really get wet?"
"That's interesting...but yeah I figured there wouldn't be much out there on men since it's primarily diagnosed in women. I will get numbness and tingling on my fingers in the middle of the night, it will literally wake me up. This is for all of you, how does it affect your relationships? For me personally, I typically burst into tears during intercourse because I feel like I'm physically broken...making relationships extremely difficult to have."
"One thing I will never be known for is tact, and I am very against stigmatizing women's health issues, so here it goes.  I still get wet too, but it is too runny to do a good job.  Overall, I have very similar symptoms.  What I find helps most is to start very slowly, lots of foreplay (fingers and or tongue to loosen up), and a good gel lubricant.  Also, can you get yourself off, or is it only during Intercourse?  Does cliteral stimulation do anything?  You may have a secondary problem if so.  I rarely if ever get off during Intercourse, but have no problem by myself (cliteral stimulation only).  Most of the time I just feel like my cervix is a punching bag.  Btw, I also have fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis, and ovarian cysts. Yay me :-)"
"My shoulders go numb most nights too.  Occasionally I'll roll over and my numb arm just stays behind like a wet noodle until I sit up and shake it out.  So far as relationships go, I gave up.  It sucks, but sometimes gotta pick your battles and it's just not worth it anymore for me.   No tears here - at least 35 years of Sjogren's destroying my tear ducts was good for something :)  Hope you have better luck and find some relief."
Thank you for your response! I have never felt anything during intercourse and only a tiny bit of pleasure when I stimulate myself.
See a rheumatologist.
"Schedule a doctor's visit asap if you can; diagnosis might take months or years. In the meantime, are you familiar with OTC treatments and supplements?"
"I would agree you should start off by seeing a rheumatologist.  I have primary Sjogren's and I have some, but not all of the symptoms you describe.  Dry mouth, nose, and skin for sure.  I have fibromyalgia too just because Sjogren's wasn't enough on its own.  I get the ulcers from time to time and another fun condition called geographic tongue.  Winter time is the worst for the dry skin.  Avoid taking hot showers as that strips away the natural oils from skin that help retain moisture.  Hope you get a diagnosis, some answers to your questions, and some relief."
This thread contains a lot of suggestions for OTC treatments and supplements.  http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?topic=10139.0
"It's sucks with Sjogren's cuz my glands don't push anything out but saliva that's like rubber cement. So, when I'm sick, there's more mucus but it can't get out and it just backs up, swells and makes my ear hurt. Frustrating."
"I'm starting to try some nootropics,  aniracetam and oxiracitam and vinpocetine.   The vinpocetine increased blood flow to the brain iirc.   I take them as a pre-workout and the aniracetam again before bed along with a  choline.  I overdosed it wit caffiene and thought I was going to lose my mind,  but otherwise I think it's been helping.  I want to try some others as well."
Plaquenil helped reduce or eliminate brain fog and fatigue.
Some foods make it worse in my opinion.
I also take b12 sublingual and that is helpful for sure
Taking Provigil and nuvigil helped me tremendously with fatigue and helped me think more clearly. I found I could be a rather talkative chap though.
Are there any side effects? Is it something that needs to be prescribed?
Prescribed by a rheumatologist. There are possible side effects which you can learn about online and ask your doctor.
"Plaquenil has few side effects, but a field vision test is recommended once a year."
I'll talk to my rheumatologist about it :) thank you
"You're welcome! Also, ask to have your vitamin D level checked with your next lab work. Deficiency can cause fatigue and brain fog. Easy fixes are eating more kinds of food that are good sources of vitamin D, getting some sunlight and taking OTC vitamin D3 supplements."
"Try writing your questions down when you go see your doctor. If you have a hard time remembering what you want to say, write it down before hand and just hand them the paper. It works really well. I recommend an easy to read list. That way they can ask you what you mean on something which will give you a chance to elaborate on your concerns while removing the pressure of remembering what you wanted to talk about."

"Sjogren's is not diagnosed solely on blood work. There are many tests that may be done for SS, but none of them are definitive and you don't need to have all of them done anyway. A doctor will choose the ones most relevant and will often do one test, wait for the result, and then move to the second level of testing. Or your doctor may just want to do them all at once. I do recommend asking your doctor what they think your symptoms mean and how certain they are of the diagnosis (if they make one). If you look at the sidebar, under ""Resources"" is a list of SS foundations of various countries. Click on the one for your country. They all should discuss how it is diagnosed in your country."

"Sjogren's, like any other disease, can be mild to severe. I have severe and am on disability. I also have other diseases. Whether you will have to quit work or not will be up to you and your doctor if and when it seems necessary. It will depend on the kind of work you do and whether other methods of managing the disease (whatever you have) work."


Sorry you have it severely I do have a list of questions to ask.. I am having a hard time find more questions to ask. I really like that you mentioned all the different testing for this. and to discuss my symptoms.  and telling me where to click AWESOME to many options is hard to see them all... That and I really don't think my brain is working as well as it did...
Thanks again!

Did you ask the basic questions?

* What actually is Sjogren's (a doctor in person can describe it better than many websites)?

* What are the short and long term problems associated with Sjogren's?

* What are some things that to watch out for? Particularly things where you should either go to the ER or call the doctor's office right away.

"* How is it managed? This should include medications and simple things like exercise, diet, skin care, eye care, etc."

* What are some things I can do now to ease the symptoms? What are some things to avoid?

"* Possibly schedule a follow up appointment. Your doc may even suggest it. If you are on meds, I would recommend a follow up in a month or two just to go over whether the meds seem to be working or if there are any side effects you are experiencing."

* (If you are prescribed meds) What are the side effects? Which side effects should I go to the ER for and which ones should I call the office about?

"* (also a meds question) Why this particular drug? If it's a brand name, ask if there is a generic alternative. If cost is an issue for you, mention that it is an issue to your doc."

"* (also meds) Have them explain how often each day to take it. Also if there are any foods you need to avoid while on the med. Get very specific instructions and then repeat it back to them. Write it down too. Yes, this info gets sent to the pharmacy, but mistakes happen and doctor's often forget to mention really key things unless you make them actually think about it. They have a lot on their minds and sometimes overlook things. And the label from the pharmacy often isn't as clear as the doctor's explanation is in the doctor's office."

"These questions are also useful even if it turns out you don't have Sjogren's. You could also ask, should your doc not have a diagnosis for you today, ""What is the next step? What needs to be done to figure out what my problems are from?"""

"You can also have someone go with you to your appointments. Someone you trust who can also keep track of what is mentioned in the appointment. It is entirely up to you of course, but some people find it very helpful and don't find the appointment as intimidating when they have someone along with them."
Saving this! Going to the doctor sends me into a panic attack. I forget everything and leave crying. Ugh but this will empower me! Thanks!
Yes this is awesome i wish i had it with my yesterday! either way i can save it for later and ask after my next test. the eye moister test
He does suspect i have this and wanted to do further testing as these things are hard to pin point from one test.

the only questions i came up with where.
anything in my diet i should avoid or eat more of to help.
He was more concerned over my thryoid. it's in normal range but he is noticing a trend.
I did ask about medication and he said not yet only if you start showing pain or other symptoms ..
I have to go back every 6 months. so i'm sure i'll be able to  ask then too.
The cool thing was he was very explaining things very well he had a new dr he was training i suppose  or some intern and really spent a lot of time with me.

Thanks for your help!!!

Glad to help.
"I am so glad you found my info so useful. It sounds like you have a good doctor. I do have hypothyroidism, pretty mildly though. I also have appointments every six months. Occasionally I have them sooner like when I have a bad flare or something. You can make an appointment anytime you think you need to, particularly if you have a new symptom or a worsening symptom. I'm actually very bad with that myself and my doctor is trying to teach me to come in whenever I need to."

If you have any other questions feel free to PM anytime.
Thanks..  i do have more questions heading over to pm...

"Some people get diagnosed with sicca syndrome rather than Sjogren's when there are no objective Sjogren's indicators (positive SSA or SSB, or positive lip biopsy). Include joint pain, rash and/or fatigue with sicca symptoms and negative ANA and some get diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease or undifferentiated tissue disease."

"Diagnosis can help with getting prescription medications called Evoxac or Salagen that help produce saliva. Saliva is important not only for oral health (cleansing enzymes), but digestive health. If you're not getting anywhere with the rheumatologist, dry mouth can be diagnosed by maybe dentist or ENT who can do a spit volume test. If experiencing joint pain and fatigue, prescription Plaquenil from rheumatologist can help alleviate or eliminate those symptoms."

"In addition to fish oil, Vitamin A is supposed to be good for tissue moisture. For dryness in ""other areas"" you can try taking female-centric probiotics such as Rephresh Pro-B or Garden of Life Vaginal. Also, my gyn said if I experienced dryness there, Replens is basically vaseline in an applicator but vaseline is less expensive (though not to be used during sex with condom because oil degrades rubber)."
"I am a seronegative Sjogren's Syndrome patient. At least 26% of SS patients have negative tests for SS antibodies, and that number is probably low. A minor salivary gland biopsy is considered the 'gold standard', but approximately 20% of SS patients will have a negative biopsy as well. In addition, the results can be difficult to interpret. I wrote a [blog entry](http://www.whatyousjo.com/2016/09/sjogrens-syndrome-diagnosis-antibodies-lip-biopsies-seronegativity-and-the-cfsmefibromyalgia-dumping-ground/) about this several months ago."

"A biopsy can, in some cases, lead to permanent nerve damage. If you do decide to go ahead, make sure you find an experienced surgeon who has done many MSG biopsies in the past. You also want an experienced lab and pathologist to review the results. My rheumatologist doesn't actually recommend the test due to those issues, but many rheumatologists will refuse to prescribe treatment without a positive test. A good rheumatologist will work with you based on your symptoms."

"I use a number of different treatment strategies to help control my SS symptoms. I've put my [treatment regimen](http://www.whatyousjo.com/treatments/my-treatment-regimen/) on my blog. Unfortunately, there are zero FDA-approved treatments for SS as a systemic disease, but there are some promising treatments in the clinical trial pipeline."

"I wish you the best of luck. If you feel like your doctor is not working for you, I recommend finding another doctor that will. As patients, we often have to be our own advocates, unfortunately."
Are you using any products to fight the dryness? Diagnosis might take yeeeears and there's no reason to suffer untill it happens.
Just eye drops and drinking water. I had a humidifier but it didn't help much. I might try to get a different one.
Humifidiers don't really seem to work for me either =/
This is what I found helpful:

* What kind of eye drops do you have? If they contain preservatives you'll likely be fine for a while (~ a year in my case) before your eyes start reacting negatively to them. Ask your eye doctor about the options.

* For night-time you can use eye *gels* or *lotions*. They stay in your eyes much longer than the drops and are honestly a godsent. Preservatives bla bla bla.

* Check in with your dentist and ask for advice on dry mouth. You can get cavities pretty quickly without saliva :(  Have regular checkups if financially possible.

"* There are a *ton* of products to keep your mouth wet. I have a special moisturizing, non-abrasive toothpaste. At night I spread mouth-gel around my mouth (surprisingly tasty!). There are saliva-stimulating sprays as well (mine tasted like apple) but during the day I find that obsessively chewing gum works just as well for a fraction of the price.  (sugar free gum with xyllitol, preferably)"

* Supplements? My eye doctor recommends omega 3 fish oil for tear production. No way to tell if it actually helps but it's relatively cheap. I also take vitamin D and B12 because those turned up low in blood test. Ymmv.

You should be able to aqcuire these without diagnosis. PM me if you need brand names (or hugs). Best of luck!
This is so helpful. Thank you. I've got some shopping to do.
"Interesting. The only thing I'd point out is that Celiac disease is a lot more than just a gluten sensitivity, you should be precise. Also, that article is from 2011, which is pretty out of date as far as the medical literature sphere goes. As a general rule I don't use articles that focus on a single patient to draw conclusions about the population as a whole."
Wife has sjogrens and gluten sensitivity.
"> 1.) Celiac disease is a lot more than just a gluten sensitivity, you should be precise."

"> Did you read the paper? It talks about Sjogren's, celiac disease and gluten intolerance. There is no test for gluten intolerance, which is a dysfunction of the innate immune system. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease like Sjogren's is. Celiac disease and gluten intolerance (this has since been re-named ""non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are not the same thing."

"> 2.) Also, that article is from 2011, which is pretty out of date as far as the medical literature sphere goes."

"> Umm, that's just not true. Up to ten years old is still relevant and if there hasn't been anything else published on a certain issue, doctors can go back much further than that. You aren't going to see a hundred papers a decade written about celiac disease's comorbidity with Sjogren's. 2011 is fairly recent. I'm a medical writer, this is something I know a bit about."

> 3.) As a general rule I don't use articles that focus on a single patient to draw conclusions about the population as a whole.

"> There are five sources listed at the end, where you will usually see references. The example of one case study is to showcase a real-life typical example. Because they *are* useful, they are published in medical journals, because it helps doctors to see a real-life example. Otherwise, they wouldn't bother publishing it. The focus of the paper isn't on the one patient, it's celiac disease, gluten intolerance (which is a different issue than celiac disease) and Sjogren's."

"I think what /u/zebra-stampede is saying is that a single case study is ranked very low in the hierarchy of evidence. I did take a look at some of the references, they're not conclusive. Still, it's common to have concurrent autoimmune diseases. I don't necessarily think you're mistaken about the link between Sjogren's and Celiac, just that the article you linked isn't great evidence. Anything past 5 years isn't considered up to date as a general rule, and is rarely quoted unless it's a landmark piece. In any case, there was a study recently published in 2015 that you may want to take a look at that specifically looks at the incidence of Sjogren's in those with celiac disease: http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/Suppl_2/1094.3"
"This is good, thank you. I'm going to leave this up a couple of days then delete OP."
"You can have seronegative arthritis. If you're having morning stiffness, that's an indication you're looking at an immune issue."

"I would go back on the plaquenil. It takes at least 3 months to start to see progress on those drugs, and if you've been off it three months, around now is when I'd expect your symptoms to start returning. I think the plaquenil was working for you."

"Colloquially, while everyone might say joints hurt in the rain or snow, that hasn't been proven without doubt by the scientific community. I say that to say, don't let the weather change be the only reason you attribute your joint pain to. I'd go back to see the rheumatologist. You might have something going on."
You sound like a candidate for a TNF inhibitor but for right now it sounds like the Plaquenil was working - it takes 5-12 weeks to build or lose an efficacious dose in your system. I would also try Voltaren gel - it's expensive here but cheap as dirt and over the counter in any First World country with a decent healthcare system.
"Have you had a positive ANA test?  That would be separate of the specific antibody test for Sjogren's.  That would indicate whether you have had an autoimmune response at some point in your life.  I share the symptoms you listed and I have fibromyalgia, Reynaud's, vasculitis, and sicca.  My doctor thought I had Sjogren's, but I don't have those antibodies, even though I do have a positive ANA test.  So my doctor diagnosed me with sicca instead.  What I have found is to stick with whatever makes me feel better, as long as I don't develop any dependencies.  I commented about the cold in a response to u/zebra-stampede."
I would go get new blood work if  were you. 4 years ago has been a long time.

"My thought on cold triggering pain (from life experience) is that I tense up from shivering when I am cold and it triggers a fibromyalgia flare-up.  I have Reynaud's as well, so I start shivering at anything below 68F.  There are days when it is very cold, but for some reason I feel comfortable with it and don't shiver.  On those days I don't have a flare-up, so that is why I think it is muscle tension from shivering rather than the actual temperature."
Thats odd i just went to the science museum last night and they had this machine that made your arms cold and they stay this is how people with arthritic feel. i didn't feel anything so maybe your right. but if there is no science backing it.. how could it be in the science museum? Not trying to be a pain... just wonder where you get your sources from? in efforts to learn and not be a blind dummy i could be wrong. (mostly am)

i wonder if it's connected to the dryness in the are or pressures around our bodys with different temps.. that stuff effects all living creatures so i can't see it not affecting us..
to me this is very very interesting .. thanks take care!
"You're confusing the two. Someone who is healthy must undergo a simulation to reach a disease state. Cold reduces joint mobility. That much is true. But there is no conclusive evidence in the scientific community that changes to weather cause identifiable changes to anatomy and structure that result in more pain. You might perceive more pain, possibly, and part of that is likely due to cultural training, but there's no anatomical mechanism to support the theory. All people respond to cold weather, that's why a normal person in a cold room could experience reduced motion. However, people with arthritis or similar do not experience cold weather any differently than normal people. That's the subtle point. No single weather change will precipitate symptoms."


**On the belief that arthritis pain is related to the weather**

"There is a widespread and strongly held belief that arthritis pain is influenced by the weather; however, scientific studies have found no consistent association. We hypothesize that this belief results, in part at least, from people's tendency to perceive patterns where none exist. We studied patients (n = 18) for more than I year and found no statistically significant associations between their arthritis pain and the weather conditions implicated by each individual. We also found that college students (n = 97) tend to perceive correlations between uncorrelated random sequences. This departure of people's intuitive notion of association from the statistical concept of association, we suggest, contributes to the belief that arthritis pain is influenced by the weather."

http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/pain-management/tips/weather-pain.php

I get what your saying however pressures of the weather do effect all of us more so those with joint pain due to the different pressures around use.
so i'm 100% confused. lol
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17466654

all of these say that weather does effect arthritic condition mainly joint pain due to the openings and in the joints have pressure. so it makes logical sense really that it does affect us.

but i'm not a dr or anything so again i'm confused .. i'd love to hash this out and learn more tho. do you have any other links i can educate myself with.. i'd love to see other studies not done in the USA . that back mine and your links!!

thanks!


"As I said,"

> No single weather change will precipitate symptoms.

"The confluence of multiple changes to various weather issues (humidity, temperature, etc) can, however."
maybe i would understand better if you define what single weather means to you?




What is your diet like? Perhaps see a dietician and find out if your immune problems are due to a lack of good gut bacteria. It doesn't sound like Sjogren's to me.
"Is the doctor checking to see if your blood is SSA or SSB positive? If your results are positive, you probably won't need to get a lip biopsy."
"I had no history of autoimmune disorders in my family either, but I came out with one. Keep following up with the tests because autoimmune disorders are very hard to diagnose, but its safer than not checking at all. Also, collaborate with a number of doctor's, don't rely on just 1 or 2 doctor's opinions. And yes check your SSA/SSB levels, that's one indicator of sjögren's as well."
F/22/filipino
"also, you don't have to have the characteristic symptoms to have sjogren's."
Ah okay..I had suspected it could also be due to some gut bacteria/infection.
"In the states I ate lots of different things, in taiwan I think it was more balanced but I'd also indulge in microwaved food, packaged ramen, processed/fast food. Trying to eat real clean now and take more supplements like peppermint oil, HCL/pepsin n such now."
"Will do. Low key freaking out about this, but also trying hard not to stress out. If they turn out negative, I'm worried they won't take it seriously enough to give me a biopsy..or rather they won't have the experience for it. People in this country typically don't get this I think."
Don't forget your probiotic foods. Those are most important.
"Got it. I hear from people its best to introduce probiotics after a cleanse, whether that be with antibiotics or a prolonged clean diet."
"Honestly, I've never heard that. I'm not sure what you mean by a ""cleanse"" or a ""clean diet."" Probiotics should be consumed at any time and fairly often to introduce more beneficial bacteria to your body which will crowd out the bad bacteria. Don't forget to eat enough fiber and prebiotc foods to help the good bacteria do their job."
"Well I know some people with gut infections or bacteria overgrowth who say they actually don't feel much or actually feel worse after taking probiotics, something to do overcrowding of bacteria, IDK. Some try to ""starve"" the bad bacteria out before introducing probiotics into the picture."
"There's really no easy answer to this. The only things you can do is be proactive: have a budget, have insurance, and be your own advocate. You might also want to consider being seen about your anxiety. A panic attack with serious physical symptoms are not usually a normal part of stress."

"I would start with writing down every medical visit you have had for say the past few months or even the year. Then call those places you've been seen and ask for the billing department. Ask them if they have any outstanding bills for you that are still pending: either waiting to be sent out or are waiting for payment. You can also ask them what they were for and how much they will be. Once you receive a bill, figure out which appointment it was for (call the billing department again if you need to), and cross it off your list. If it is too much that you can't pay all at once, call up the billing department and set up a payment plan. Usually they want at least $50 a month or some percentage of the bill. If even that is too much ask if they have any assistance available. You can also contact your local county to see if there is any assistance available for medical needs."

Start budgeting for your medical expenses if you don't already and get insurance if you can and make sure your insurance (if you get it) will cover your normal meds and clarify what is and is not covered.

"Be your own advocate. Sometimes a doctor wants to have a procedure done or wants you on a medication that you just can't afford. Just tell them no for now. If you're not sure if you can afford it, tell the doctor you'll get back to them after you've checked to see how much the procedure or medication is and whether it is covered by insurance (if you have any). Sometimes, hospitals are really vague about things like MRIs because the cost is going to depend on a lot of factors. Ask for the absolute most expensive scenario and assume that is what it will cost."
"Most medical centers and providers offer payment plans, so even if you can only pay a small amount each month, it will be okay. Call, ask to speak with billing, then say you'd like to create a payment plan. Also, if you make below a certain amount, they'll provide financial assistance and forgive your bill every so often. For some places it's one time ever, for other places it's once every so many years. I've even seen as often as once every 2 years before."
"Wow, good thing your primary care physician was so thorough and knowledgeable. Although you were living like that for a long time, he was quick to figure everything out and help get it addressed."

"In addition to the resources /u/myintellectisbored mentioned, Sjogrensworld.org is a great website for information. There are a few relatively inactive subforums that contain a lot of useful information. The most active forum for interaction among people with Sjogren's regarding daily life type stuff is ""Living with Sjogren's"". The members, who are responsive and supportive, often have other autoimmune diseases (scleroderma being among them) as is common among the AI population."

"Given your age, you might also be interested in the FB group ""Under 40 With Sjogren's"". It's a closed group, meaning posts and membership are not visible to people outside of the group, so you have to contact the administrator to request admission. I'm not a member so I don't know how active it is."
"Edit: I realize I'm super late in joining the conversation ... I keep forgetting how relatively inactive the sub is--which hey, great, I'd love if it didn't exist at all because then we'd be cured! Anyway, hello fellow spoonies/moisture seekers/whatever other cool nicknames we have. ^^"

"Sorry to hear about all your trouble. Getting hit with a load of autoimmune junk is really hard at this point in life, I know."

"I grew up with a localized form of scleroderma (skin only, no organ involvement) and was more recently diagnosed with Sjogren's. I'm guessing you have systemic scleroderma, since you only mentioned the white spots on your skin--those of us with localized often have plaques of waxy, brown/red/purple areas (though even systemic patients will exhibit some hardening of the skin like we do)."

"Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Again, I may not be in the exact same boat as you, but I've been on the sclero scene for a while and I can certainly point you toward some great resources. Mostly, just wanted to say you're not alone."

"Oh, and as the others have mentioned, Facebook has loads of very active support groups for just about any diagnosis you have. BYDLS/Spoon Theory will be a valuable asset in explaining your condition to people who otherwise just don't get it. Also check out Inspire, which has several communities for specific diseases and disorders. Helpful if you don't want to risk your support group activity popping up on somebody's Facebook feed (would you believe I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder?)."

"Take care, stay strong, and don't take anybody's crap."
"This is what I tell people when they ask if I want to go out drinking: I don't drink. If they press the issue, I mention that I'm on a medication that already taxes my liver and drinking would just add to that so I don't drink."

"There are so many forums and resources online, but I generally don't participate much. There is [Patients Like Me](https://www.patientslikeme.com/) where you can track your diseases, input meds, see what others have done, and connect with others dealing with Sjogren's and scleroderma."

The [Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation](http://www.sjogrens.org/) has quite a lot of useful info about Sjogren's. Check out the sidebar for this sub as well. They have links for online and local support groups and other organizations.

"And, finally, [this site](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/) is just a good site to check out for anyone that has ""an invisible illness"". There are lots of articles and information about fibro, lupus, Sjogren's, etc. And check out her [Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) article. That helped many of my non-sick friends understand my fatigue and other issues better."
Facebook has a number of closed groups.  Search for Sjogrens and ask to join them all.  There is a particularly good one called LDN for Sjogrens... which talks about novel treatments based on science and not voodoo...  LDN (low dose naltrexone) being one of those treatments that has changed my life.

Just curious are you male or female... Post didn't say.


">Then I explained how I've always felt and how things are now: skin dehydrated to the core, ever-constant fatigue, **white spots on my skin,** no appetite, weight loss."

Can you a question about this? What exactly do you mean by white spots? Are they like white little hard dots?


Thank you!!!! I really appreciate this.
Thank you SO much. It really means a lot that people are giving me this much advice. I wish you the best of luck
"I'll definitely look into FB groups, thanks so much. I'm a female."
"I had some hard spots, but they were dark brown/black. The white spots are from vitiligio, so they're flat"

"A minor salivary gland biopsy would be the next step if you really want a diagnosis. I recommend finding an oral surgeon or ENT with considerable experience offering MSBGs, as it can cause permanent nerve damage. You also want an experienced lab to analyze the results."

"Seronegativity is quite common for SS patients. A John Hopkins study found that 26% of patients had a positive lip biopsy and SS symptoms but negative blood tests, while approximately 21% of patients will have a negative lip biopsy but positive blood tests and symptoms. In other words, neither test is perfect, and it is possible to have SS with completely negative results. I actually wrote a [blog post](http://www.whatyousjo.com/2016/09/sjogrens-syndrome-diagnosis-antibodies-lip-biopsies-seronegativity-and-the-cfsmefibromyalgia-dumping-ground/) on this subject a couple months ago."
Have you had a lip biopsy?  I'm told that is the gold standard for SS.

Ever looked into the autoimmune paleo (AIP) diet?
"hello, I've been having extreme dry eyes where I've had meibomian gland probing , eye. plugs and now  eye lid expressions. I had blood tests for sjorgens syndrome which resulted in negative then I just went to the ear nose & throat specialists to get a lip biopsy waiting for results. Meanwhile my ophthalmologist is treating me for meibomian gland dysfunction. this eye condition is very. disabiling I have photo sensitivity where I wear glasses all the time. can any share with me specific blood tests required to test for sjorgens syndrome right now my three glands for the eyes for tears and oil are dry please everyone respond back."
"Sounds like you have a kink in your small intestines that is pushing gas up to your diaphram. Check to see if you have ischemia and/or a non-obvious hernia. It will allow you to digest food, but the gas buildup will cause upward bloating that pinches the vagus nerve, below the stomach, causing bone dry mouth/eyes. That is the biggest reason you are testing negative for ANAs. Based on the info you gave. Im not a doctor, but it happened to me, and i got it cleared up with laparoscopic surgery."
Thanks so much for the info. I'm going to your blog now.
"Very interesting, re: diagnosis criteria and false negative rate. Thanks, Whatyousjo."
"I am on AIP! It does help! I will ask about the biopsy,  thanks."
These are the common Sjogren's tests:

ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody) ANAs are a group of antibodies that react against normal components of a cell nucleus. ...

RF (Rheumatoid Factor) ...

SS-A (or Ro) and SS-B (or La) ...

ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) ...

IGs (Immunoglobulins)
Great!  How long have you been on it?

I need to get back on it.  Right now I'm having a few symptoms & my eczema is flaring.
For a few weeks. After last Thanksgiving it took getting constant migraines and being nearly bedridden to get my shit back together.
"This time of year is so hard.  Sugar is a big one for me, and there's pretty much 6 months of candy temptation between Halloween & Easter."
"Gluten-free bread for me. I'm weaning steadily, which is the only way I can do it. Going low carb is really hard for me an impossible cold-turkey. I don't seem to make ketones as fast as most people do, but once I get there, I'm fine."
"Find a new rheumatologist if this one is not prescribing Plaquenil, Restasis, etc., to help with your symptoms. You don't have to have a positive blood test to have Sjogren's."
New Dr says I have Collagen Vascular disease. He says its a BS term. Back on Plaquenil. Basically I have markers in my blood for Lupus but cant be diagnosed with it. Also confirmed for antiphosolipid syndrome. Feeling better on Plaquenil. Also on anti-inflammatory. Be strong in 2017
I went to hematologist other day to confirm APS. Extremely high level. He thinks i should go to new Rheumatologist.have appointment next week.
I have a negative ANA and the rheumo is still strongly considering a Sjogren's diagnosis for me because of my other symptoms. My ESR and CRP (inflammatory markers) are high and always have been since the beginning of my journey to get a diagnosis. He tried me on a course of prednisone (did not help unfortunately) and I am back with him in December to have more tests done.

Basically - you can have a negative ANA and have Sjogren's. The diagnosis is not based solely on the results of the ANA blood test. Also weirdly my mother is now being investigated for lupus - she has a positive ANA - but her inflammatory markers are completely normal. We're like the opposite of one another haha.
Sounds exactly like you are in intestinal distress. I would point to a crohns/colitis diagnosis.  Distention from trapped gas through the digestive cycle. Resulting in damage to the vagus nerve.
"If it's of any comfort to anybody new to SJS, I have always tested negative to virtually every blood test I've ever had. I did once have elevated ANA and ENA but they returned to normal."

"I am always negative for ESR despite experiencing a lot of joint pain and stiffness. The only inflamatory marker that ever shows up in blood tests is CRP, which is sometimes quite high but not 'remarkably so' according to my GP. I have always tested negative for RF. I recently had a lip biopsy (3 months ago) which I have not chased the results for because it will probably be negative as well."

"However, for the last 9 months I have had bilateral parotid swelling which is quite profound. I have had dry and gritty eyes on and off for years, but in recent months I have experienced severe mouth dryness. I produce only very little saliva and have to use an artificial saliva (which is disgusting). I do not produce tears now (I rarely cry...it's a man thing, you know?) but even onions or bouts of yawning that used to produce tears now produce nothing apart from small painful bumps on my eyelids that itch like mad and the corners of my eyes get red and angry and feel grossly swollen. I use artificial tears when that happens."

I also have had hypogonadism which has required treatment with synthetic Testosterone for the last 12 months or so.

"Over the years I have been 'diagnosed' with AS, Lupus, RA, PSA, and Spondyloarthropathy. All seronegative. I have severe bouts of IBD type symptoms from time to time, as well as profound acid reflux at night whenever that happens"

"Thankfully, I have a GP and Rhuematologist that aren't driven solely by blood chemistry results.  I do not have 'classic' SJS. I have no idea whether it's secondary of primary SJS (not sure I even care). After 3+ months of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate and a different Anti-TNF treatment, plus steroids and sometimes Voltarol orally,  I am noticing that I feel less fatigued and some of the SJS type symptoms are easing. Even the parotid swelling is less noticeable."

"But to some medical people that I have seen, there is 'nothing wrong' with me. I think I probably have seronegative SJS. So long as any treatment works, I don't actually care what those medical people think."

EDIT:

"I forgot to mention that Methotrexate by injection is the best thing ever invented. I have used it for years and I cannot live without it as the symptoms of whatever is wrong with me just overtake me and leave me unable to function. I also cannot tolerate bright light, especially sunlight when I'm driving in the winter months. When the sun is low in the sky and produces a 'strobe' effect through the trees as I drive along, it really affects me. I cannot tolerate that from any angle of my eyesight and have to wear sunglasses."

"I'm not a 'sick' person though and rarely miss work. I think I have missed about 4 weeks combined in 10 years. If you get to see the right people and get the right treatment, you can readily live with an Autoimmune disease, even if it's never quite clear just what that disease really is."

Really? Why is that
"Many people with Sjogren's are seronegative, meaning it doesn't show up in their blood tests. Search ""seronegative Sjogren's"" for details and explanations."

Some doctors have seronegative patients get a lip biopsy as an additional diagnostic tool.
"very strange, because for my 3 rheumatologist to be impossible in the absence of ANA and ENA, I'm in the same situation.Now I would try what you have written this girl in Italian forum: http://www.freeforumzone.com/d/6521086/La-Sindrome-di-Sjogren/discussione.aspx?idm1=133415648&pl=9"

* Restasis irritated my eyes. Caused a burning sensation that was most likely from the small amount of preservatives (according to my doctors).

"* Punctal plugs also caused irritation. Felt like I had a stone in my eye. However, they were easy to have put in and easy to have removed so I would recommend trying them."

"* Pilocarpine - Very little benefit for me. Rheumy wants me to try one of the other ones, but I'm hesitant."

"* My eye doc says that in my case having eye drops made from my own blood is the only thing left, but it's very expensive. I haven't done it yet, but it is another possibility."

"I have tried some eye drops called FreshKote that work great although I can't take them as often as I should because of the same issue I had with Restasis: burning from the preservatives. They are also kind of spendy, around $35 for a small bottle. I also use GenTeal Gel drops. I love this stuff too. Not as thick as overnight gels, but seems to provide much better relief than typical OTC eye drops."
"Just chiming in to say that restasis did s whole lotta nothing and cost a whole lotta money. Not worth it, IMO. Have not tried the others you asked about."
"Restasis has been very helpful to me. I have been using it for about 4 years. At first, my Schirmer's test scores jumped from the low single digits to the mid-double digits. Gradually they dropped a bit, but I'm still able to get buy without using any other eye drops. I believe that they are more helpful the earlier that you start using them; I started using them before I had any other SS symptoms aside from dry eye."

"I tried punctal plugs, they there were somewhat irritating and didn't seem to improve my dry eye after several months, so I stopped. You might want to try Ubiquinol as a supplement."

There is a newly approved prescription eye drop called Xiidra that could be an option if Restasis doesn't work for you. You can [read more here](http://www.whatyousjo.com/2016/08/xiidra-lifitegrast-a-new-prescription-eye-drop-for-dry-eye-approved-by-the-fda).
Restasis has worked wonders for me. When I put it in it is the most relief I get all day and my eyes look great afterwards. Make sure to put in preservative free eye drops 15 minutes prior to prevent burning. Also I find waiting the recommended 12 hours between doses minimizes any burning afterwards. Recently I started refrigerating my drops and have had very little burning.
"- was on Restasis for 9 months, nothing changed. It is obviously easy to use and it didn't irritate my eyes, but is really expensive if you don't see results"
#NAME?
- I had all four punctal plugs put in and they also did not help. Sometimes really irritated my eyes if they weren't put in right
"- WHAT WORKED FOR ME: borage oil and vit B12 supplements!!!! After trying everything, this seems silly and simple but it has been the only thing that has relieved my dry eyes significantly. So it's definitely worth a try"

message me if you want details on the borage brands etc. good luck!

ok here is a link to the kind I use! it's important to have the GLA in it
Thank you for your input! I'm sorry al these things haven't worked out for you.


May I ask for how long you tried to use restasis and if you had any other side effects? I've read scary reviews about increased blood pressure and difficulty breathing but this may just be people who happen to be allergic to the product.


I hope the serum drops work out for you!
I'm sorry it didn't work for you. May I ask how long you tried using it and what kind of side effects (if any) you experienced? Thank you for reacting!
"Thank you so much! Can you send me the details for the borage oil, please?"
Thank you :)
Just confused about one thing: wouldn't you want more omega 3 as opposed to omega 6 to combat inflammation? That's what my dietician is recommending me at least.
"I did Restasis for about 3 months or so. The only issue I had was the burning sensation. I also didn't see much relief from it. My issue is less about tear production and more about the crappy quality of my tears. I still produce tears (although not much), but there isn't anything like lipids that help my tears adhere to the eye so what few tears I do produce are basically worthless."

"I might eventually do the serum drops, but I have no plans on it right now because of the expense. It usually isn't covered by insurance."

"I should also mention that while FreshKote doesn't need a prescription (in the US), but you will need to go to a pharmacist to get it. This stuff and the gel drops have done a lot to help my eyes."

"According to my eye doctor, I can use preservative free (single use drops) as often as I need to. That helps too. I avoid anything that has ""redness removal"" and I find ones that specifically for severe dry eyes or those who have had Lasik surgery."

"I have had severe dry eye going on for nearly 30 years although I wasn't actually diagnosed until about 7 or 8 years ago. Things like wrap around sunglasses when outside, avoiding bright lights, using amber lights, and adjusting computer screens to ease eye strain very helpful in addition to drops and stuff. I hope you are able to find some relief. Everything, even over the counter stuff, can have side effects and only you can decide which risks are worth it. Even though Restasis or Pilocarpine didn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't work for you."
"I think it was about six months or so. I don't recall any side effects, but my ophthalmologist had advised me to store it in the refrigerator to mitigate some of the burning/stinging and I did, so that may have helped."
"I'm not sure the answer to your question, but I'll just chime in to say I've been on fish oil (omega 3) for several years (long before I suspected Sjogren's) and it helps with the dry eyes a bit."

"Edit: Forgot to mention, I'm now on Restasis too. Burning sensation others are mentioning subsided after a month or so. My doc also gave me a card for a discounted 30 day prescription and free 90 day prescriptions, so I would ask about that. My mom who has unrelated dry eyes is on Xiidra, but I think the mechanism behind Xiidra is less equipped to treat our dry eyes than Restasis."
"I combine Working Hands with whatever scent of B&BW hand cream doesn't bother me too much. It makes my hands silky smooth and last longer than using just one or the other. WH is good for repair, and the hand cream locks in moisture."
Eucerin Intensive Repair hand cream has been my g-to product for years.  It's not greasy and has AHA.
I like Neutrogena and vanicream
Neutrogena Norwegian formula. Only thing that works for me.
"I don't want to tell you it is or isn't cause I'm not a doctor, but if you wanted to investigate, you should see a rheumatologist. It'll probably take you a while to get in, so while you wait, you could see your eye doctor who can analyze your tear film and tear production and your dentist to talk about your saliva production. If you have some identifiable issues in either of those, that will help inform the rheumatologist."
It does indeed sound like you are dealing with systemic autoimmunity.


"First and foremost, I would recommend going on the autoimmune paleo diet. This will reduce the amount of inflammation in your body."


"Secondly, I would get a bunch of tests done at the doctor's office:"

C reactive protein

Erythrocye sedimentation rate

Anti-nuclear antibodies

SS-A

SS-B

TSH - full thyroid panel

Female hormone panel

Schirmer test + tear viscosity test

Hepatitis B

Hepatitis C

Hepatitis Delta

EBV titer

HSV-1 antibodies and titer


Honestly I would just print the list and try to get them all run. Good luck to you. Reply to this comment if you have any questions. I'm happy to help.
I have a lot of things on that list of yours and I was diagnosed this past year with Sjogrens. I also have interstitial cystitis which is mostly in remission now and have had vaginal problems in the past. The only thing that helped me was pelvic floor therapy and taking probiotics with acidopholis. My pelvic floor is still recovering but I am much more comfortable than I was a year ago. While being diagnosed can be a relief the main thing right now is to treat your symptoms and feel better.
"Should I find a rheumatologist to do all those tests, or take the list to my PCP and see if she'll sign off on them?"
The following should definitely be done at the PCP as soon as possible:

C reactive protein

Erythrocye sedimentation rate

Anti-nuclear antibodies

SS-A

SS-B

"Now, keep in mind, that even if all these come back negative, you may still have Sjogren's! However, if you have elevated SS-A or SS-B, you definitely have Sjogren's. In other words, these test have high sensitivity and low specificity."

"The other stuff, your PCP is going to tell you are not routine, and she may grill you on why you need them done. I will go over the others quickly, one by one:"

"Thyroid panel: this should be done because with your gender, age group, and symptoms, there is a good chance you also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It's also just a good panel to run every once in a while anyway."

"Female hormone panel: Autoimmune disease can mess with hormone levels. It's good to check them, but I wouldn't push this one if your PCP is reluctant"

Schirmer test: This needs to be done by an opthalmologist or possibly an optometrist. It measures the tear production of your eyes. This will be crucial to you getting a diagnosis. Ask your PCP for a referral and/or Rx for the procedure.

"Viral tests: These can be done later. If you get a positive diagnosis of Sjogren's, you should test for these viruses, as Sjogren's seems to have a viral etiology. In other words, some instances of Sjogren's may be caused by a viral infection."
I already have thyroid panels done every 6 months due to my being hypothyroid. I take Synthroid for it. Is Hashimotos different from just regular hypothyroid issues?

"I also know I've tested positive or the EBV titer in the past. The doctor I was seeing at that time just shrugged and said, ""Eh, no big deal."""

"I have to go in anyway this week for my thyroid blood work anyway, so I'll take this list with me, and see if she's game."

Edit: and thank you for being taking the time to discuss this and go over this with me.
"You have systemic autoimmunity. It's not uncommon for women to get multiple autoimmune diseases, like Sjogren's, Hashimoto's, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis, etc."

"The high EBV titer is likely causing your body to release high levels of interferon gamma (IFNy), which aggravates autoimmunity, and predisposes you to Sjogren's in particular. In Russia, you would be treated with antivirals. Here in the US, your high EBV titer probably won't be treated, but it should be."

For the help - you're very welcome. Let us know how it goes and what your PCP wants to try for the next step.
"BTW you should look into taking dessicated thyroid - ask your PCP about it, it's pretty great; and you really need to get on the autoimmune paleo diet:"

Not much to add other than I also get flares right before my period. My knees are killing me at the moment and I just know my dryness is coming next. I'm at 6 days from my period.
I talked to my rheumy about it. and he said to track it 4 month more and we'll make a decision then. No idea what that decision could be. I'm on plaquenil only.
"Years before I got diagnosed, I noticed what I now know is brain fog and joint pain the week before my cycle. I used to say that I felt like I hadn't woken all the way up or my brain was in a cloud. I had Sjogrens but didn't know it then. Now, it just feels like a mini flare. You aren't alone."
I've been noticing the same thing! I'm going to keep a record of it to see if it's consistent.
"I agree. The summer is the worst. I live in an area that has little humidity, never rains all summer, high temps and no clouds. My eyes and mouth feel like the desert and my joints ache. I've had the biggest swollen glands on my right side for a few weeks now. Never hurt my ears in my life til a few days ago. It's awful. I'm sitting next to a humidifier all day and it's not helpful. Hope you feel better soon."

Is ear pain part of Sjogren's? I am newly diagnosed and still trying to understand it. I have had ear pain that feels like an ear infection for months. I even went to an ENT because I didn't believe my primary care doc that my ear wasn't infected. The ENT said my ear was fine too and that maybe the pain was due to TMJ. Now I wonder if it could have something to do with Sjogren's. My hearing is also affected sometimes.
"Yes, it is. I find actually that my hearing level can vary a lot depending upon how much inflammation there is. My hearing is naturally pretty good, better than most people actually, and I've been lucky in that because probably it's helped me that it was so good to start with because I suspect that I am suffering from a mild hearing loss at times. So far it's come back once the inflammation goes down but my biggest fear is that I am going to lose my hearing, my sight or both. I don't have just SS. I have several autoimmune diseases. All of them are taking their toll. A lot the therapies haven't worked on me. I have too many problems taking meds. Many of them screw me up much worse than the diseases. I just cannot do them. If I have another 25 years on this planet I will surprised. The SS as annoying and painful as it it, it's been the least of it for me."
Thanks for your reply. It helps hearing what others are going through. I'm sorry you have to deal with all of that. I hope you can find something to give you some relief!
"I didn't even notice how dry my eyes were until I went to an ophthalmologist who did some tests and told me I have mild-moderate dry eye in both eyes. It came on gradually so I guess I just adjusted to it. I was never able to wear contacts because they were so uncomfortable, but I never put two and two together. You may go to an ophthalmologist and get a full work up just to make sure, and mention that you've had some tests indicating Sjogrens."
"How are your eyes and mouth? My biggest problem, besides the pain, was waking up multiple times a night with my eyes glued shut and having to drink water, and eye dryness throughout the day. It gets really bad when I flare."
Also worth noting- I have crap eyes so I go to the optometrist frequently but they don't routinely do any testing for dry eyes so it went unnoticed bc I wasn't complaining about it.
"So, I haven't noticed eye involvement. I am always thirsty, but I wouldn't even say I have a dry mouth, just always thirsty."

"At first when reading the symptoms of Sjogrens, I didn't think I had it, but the blood work seems to indicate it."

"I guess it could be lupus, but I don't have the light sensitivity or buttery fly rash."
"You sound just like me. I guess my eyes were always dry but I didn't realize it. First Schirmer's test I scored 3 and 4. My last, I scored 0's in both eyes. Same with saliva. My mouth seemed dry and always had dental issues but didn't know it was different than anyone else's experience. Lol. In the past I remember seeing dudes spit in the street and asking my husband how anyone could spit that much stuff up at once. He didn't think it was it was a big amount. I made him show me how much saliva he had in his mouth and there was a ton. I think I stupidly thought maybe women made less saliva or something."
"Of course, my biggest issue has always been the pain you describe. Your symptoms sound a lot like mine."
Same here!

"I mean, several forums and the like have said that you don't get false positives for autoimmune things. The fact that I did test positive for SSB indicates something is happening, and most likely it is Sjogrens."

"My GP is trying to get my Rheumy on the phone to ask what we should do next, but for now he put me on Elavil, since I couldn't afford cymbalta."
"So my Rheumy said the numbers don't mean much, but then went ahead and put me on a course of Prednisone, and Plaquenil. Told me to see if symptoms are better on the meds, then when they run out to see if things get worse again... seems like this is all a guess and check thing."
"There are two great SS groups on fb: Sjögren's Syndrome foundation and the Sjögren's Syndrome alternative therapy group, you should check 'em out!"
"You already have UCTD, and now you have dry eye and dry mouth? Sjogren's seems like a real possibility. Dentists are often not very familiar with Sjogren's Syndrome; an ENT may be more helpful if you are experiencing dry mouth. Saliva flow is the typical test."

"Approximately 1/3 of SS patients are seronegative, meaning that their blood work is negative (I am one of them). These results can change over time, but aren't necessary for a SS diagnosis. Do you have a positive ANA? Most people with UCTD do."

"I'm not a big supporter of salivary gland biopsies, and neither is my rheumatologist. I would not have had one done if I had found my rheumatologist sooner. There are real risks of nerve damage and infection, and your results might be negative even if you have SS. Ideally, you would find a rheumatologist to treat your symptoms regardless of blood work, especially if you have UCTD. If you already on Plaquenil, the only real prescription treatments would be Restasis for dry eye and Evoxac/Salagen for dry mouth, neither of which require a SS diagnosis to prescribe. Alternative therapies don't require a SS either, since you typically have to undertake them on your own."

"If you do have a lip biopsy, be sure to find an oral surgeon with a lot of experience doing salivary gland biopsies."
"Hey there. I had the lip biopsy done and I'm glad that I did it because it confirmed that I have Sjogren's. Like you, I tested negative for the antibodies. I'll be getting bloodwork again soon so I'm curious to see if they will ever show up."

My lip biopsy was performed by an ENT and ordered by my rheumy. I was totally numb for the actual procedure. It hurt pretty bad the rest of the day and into that evening (big ole bruised fat lip) but for me it was worth it..especially since I have had no complications from it.

"For me and my peace of mind, I needed to at least try all I could to receive a definitive diagnosis. I realize sometimes this isn't possible."

"After I received the positive diagnosis i was like ""yes!!!!!! I knew it wasn't all in my head! See! I told you!!"""

"Followed by ""Crap..there really is something wrong."""

Mixed emotions for sure.
"Thanks for the reply, I hadn't heard about the danger involved in a lip biopsy- I thought it would be quick and painless."

"My rheumy gave me a dx of UCTD because all of my blood work was normal (negative ANA, RF factor, Sed rate, etc) except extremely low complement C4 levels (which he said could be genetic, or maybe caused by disease processes). That said, I've been dealing with debilitating back, wrist, neck, elbow, and small finger joint pain and swelling for years, as well as dry mouth and dry eyes (which I had attributed to allergies as I'm allergic to mold which is an all year problem here in central Texas).   I will get my bloodwork redone in August to see if anything has changed. He started me on plaquenil 3 months ago, and I just started exovac and restasis this week. I feel like the plaquenil is really starting to help a lot!!! My back and wrists feel the best they have in a long time. Exovac is a bizarre drug and I can't decide if I would rather just deal with the dry mouth vs. the weird hot flashes, sweating, and headaches when it starts to wear off, but I've noticed it seems to be helping my vaginal and eye dryness as well, so I'm going to stick it out for awhile and see if I get used to the side effects."

"I've had extensive dental work (I have over 15 fillings, 2 crowns, a root canal, etc). and they always told me it was probably genetic deficiency in enamel so I'm pissed to find out that i have clinically significant dry mouth and no one thought that it might be contributing! So hopefully exovac helps out with that."

"I guess if these therapies are helping then I shouldn't obsess too much over a diagnosis, but it would put my mind at ease to be able to tell others THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME, IT'S REAL, I'M IN REAL PAIN! Because my whole family and to an extent my boyfriend think I'm a hypochondriac and a pill popper."

"Anyways, thanks for the super helpful reply. My rheumy is great and so is my opthamologist so I feel like I'm in good hands."

"I'm sure your doctors have probably asked, but is it possible that the dryness is being caused by a side-effect?  There are a lot of medications that can cause sudden extreme dryness like you are describing- allergy meds & anti-depressants being among them. Corticosteroid nasal sprays jack with my sense of taste."

"The only times I have had abrupt flares come on have been in times of incredible stress- an especially stressful emotional event (getting super upset/crying type of deal) will bring on a flare for me within a day and I'll feel like garbage for days afterwards. In a moment of high anxiety, my mouth will go bone dry in an instant. Otherwise, flares, for me anyway, tend to come on gradually. Changes in weather and general stress have both triggered gradual flares for me, and sometimes they come on for seemingly no reason."

"Everyone's body is different so it's hard to say what is normal and what isn't in regards to flares. If you don't have any other symptoms and the bloodwork is negative (or if your doctor is pretty sure it's not Sjogren's) it won't hurt to start looking at other possibilities. If new symptoms develop or the ones you have persist, you can always try the blood work again in the future."
"I definitely had periods where my mouth felt dry and blurry vision well before the dryness became daily and prominent. I was also very sensitive to medications that caused dryness as a side effect. It could be that you are just to early in the disease to tell if you do have sjogren's. I believe I've had symptoms that date back to childhood. Within the last 2 years, I started with dry eyes and a year later developed joint pain. My mouth is only somewhat dry and has been slowly getting drier. Soon after the joint pain came periods of fatigue. Everyone is different. This last week or so I've been feeling great but just got more intense joint pain today that is indicative of a flare coming on. My best advice is to create a symptom diary and right down any stress in your life and see if it correlates with your symptoms. You might just have to wait and see and treat your symptoms."
I know this is a comment from a long time ago. About your dog that they say bit but it scratched. Don't know how else to get a hold of you but here is what you need to know. Dogs have upper and lower teeth meaning a bite will have 2 lines as in two sets of teeth. Was there 2 sets of lines? Show them pics of dog bites and then what they showed. I know this is old news but you know for next time bud.

"My doctors are too overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of symptoms I have with zero signs of anything. Plus a big dose of ""not my job"" as they pawn me off on each other. Frustrating."

I know I get crazy painful dryness reactions from gabapentin and steroids. I am also eyeing Welbutrin as a culprit -- but it's so hard to switch antidepressants and it's done so we'll for me for the past 5 years.

I've started contemplating getting a mold allergy test. I am pretty sure this building I live in is encased in mold.

Thanks for letting me know your experiences!

"I have a backdrop of gradually fluctuating baseline of symptoms with random spikes lasting hours to days to 2 weeks, then I go back to the current baseline. Heck, one time in the midst of one of the most painful months I've had I suddenly had 2 hours of perfect health, then crashed even lower than I was before."

It's very frustrating to try to figure it all out. But I keep trying!
"It seems each time you flare it's a little different, isn't it? I used to mostly get terrible fatigue, low grade fever and brain fog. Now, sometimes it's fatigue, fever and saliva glands. This week, I'm having a flare and experiencing terrible joint pain and super dry mouth but no fatigue or brain fog. I give up trying to figure it out. Even if I'm not flaring one symptom or another is on full blast. It's really depressing me."
"Hey hey! That's a good point no one else ever thought of. I was never able to see the picture, but everyone described it as a single line."

The two year anniversary of her death is tomorrow. And this makes me feel a bit better about her life. Thanks.
"Sorry to hear about your loss.I'm in a similar situation but I am lucky my best bud used to breed protection dogs, even sold on to Snoop Dog. So with his letter stating that it is 100% scientifically impossible a one line cut came from a dog bite, and a letter from a vet i know verifying his claim, and me providing proof the girl is a liar and mentally ill, I am very confident the appeal will be decided in my favour but it takes over a month for them to decide."
It turns out in my case politics was a huge issue. I apparently had no chance from the get go.

We lost. She was required to be muzzled in public until we proved she was no longer a risk. I made a video of her and asked for her to be no longer deemed a threat. They agreed and lifted her muzzle order.

Man. That was a traumatic 9 months for me.
I hear you. It has been the most depressing 2 months of my life. My dog has a muzzle order until I win the appeal. I am just so grateful that my bud realized that. I am sure you can relate it becomes all you can think about. It became an obsession trying to win this. I told them to get an animal psychologist to examine it all and if i lose I will pay for it. You start talking to them knowing you are right and providing proof they quickly pay attention.
Yes!! It is all consuming! People just couldn't understand. But I was so obsessed.

"I did get a dog psychologist, and it turns out she was involved in the politics. <sigh> We talked to our lawyer after and he apologized saying if he understood all the relationships beforehand he wouldn't have basically taken so much of our money in billable hours."

"Turns out the guy hearing my case had a lot of sympathy for me, but their lives would have been made much harder if they didn't rule against me. So, once the heat was off his back, he was more than happy to lift the muzzle order."
"and they so ARE. I'm living on Tylenol today. I look like I have mumps. All of the saliva glands they are just throbbing, frequent use of Blue Ice notwithstanding. I so HATE when this happens. It's so damned painful it makes me want to whine, only that hurts too much too, sniff..."
Sounds like you're having a really hard time - I'm truly sorry.  Thank you for taking the time to respond.
Why is it that an upper respiratory infection would be a leading indicator of saliva glands flaring up?  My wife just experience d something similar:  URI and then flattened by eye inflammation.  Is this a known pattern we should look out for?
"Any infection when you have Sjogren's can lead to this. When the immune system goes crazy fighting a bug this is a normal thing. It's what triggers Sjogren's attacks in the first place, the immune system being overactive, but in particular any kind of sinus related thing, URI aggravates that whole area. I don't think I've ever had a cold without it happening immediately after. I can't even allow myself cry actually. If I do I spend a week after sick like this. My Dad passed in Dec? It's been really hard at times not crying, but when I start to I just have to make myself stop. Crying makes me extremely ill. My sinuses get inflamed, the glands in my face swell up. It's awful."
[There are co-morbidities with Inclusion Body Myositis](http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/4/440.long).

Not a lot of treatment options though.
"My last few tests have shown decreased liver function. Right now, my GP is  just keeping an eye on it. I'm not even sure what it means but I'm going to take my results to my next rheumotologist appt.  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful."
"If I were you, I would go to the opthalmologist about the bump on your lid. In the meantime, continuing use of lubricating drops is probably okay. While at the doctor appointment, if you find that the eye drops you are using on a daily basis are not sufficient to address your symptoms, ask if Restasis or punctal plugs may help you."

"Also, ask your rheumatologist about Evoxac or Salagen for your dry mouth. Consult with your dentist, too, as lack of saliva can lead to cavities and other dental problems."
I second on the plugs.  Great for relief of irritation and pain in eyes and surrounding areas.

Sometimes Sjogren's Syndrome does not show up in blood work.  Be aware that your symptoms are more important than your blood work.
"I have swollen lymph nodes in my throat and armpits more often than not. Along with fever and fatigue, they were my first symptom. Mine go up and down and are painful. I do not have lymphoma. I do have Sjögren's and Dysautonomia."
"I went through the lymphoma scare 2 years ago.  I had radioactive scans, visits with oncologist and others.  Your fear isn't irrational. It's the fear of what if, the unknown, the possibilities.  Follow through on your fears.  What kind of treatment can I get, who do i know who has had cancer that i can talk to, etc."

"I hate doctors leaving us with our thoughts over the weekend.  Take the damn test on Tuesday.  Whatever the results are on Monday, you will get through this.  You are not alone.  After 3 months of testing, they said ehh, we don't know what it is.  Not lymphoma.  Live with it.  I have been for 2 years now.  ""They"" assume just how my Sjogren's and dysautonomia interact and present.  This disease is under studied and not well known.  Be prepared for lots of fun on this stupid ride.  Soft hugs. 💞"
"Man, good luck.  I think we all get anxious about that.  I went in with what I was sure were swollen lymph nodes and my doc told me I was just getting fat...  kind of embarrassing."
"I look like I have mumps half the time and every gland in my body I think is affected by my autoimmune disease. It does freak me out all the swollen glands and the pain. I'm secondary Sjogren's. My eyes are bad, very dry, but the I don't have dry mouth often unless I am talking a lot. I'm told I have good moisture levels for someone with this, except for the dry eye thing. But then again I'm primary Lupus so."

"So far, so good, but yeah I do worry. I have never gone into remission with this. My doctor can't seem to find any drug I can tolerate that actually works on me and this is just hell to live with. I've had swollen glands the whole time though and it's been a decade almost since I was diagnosed. It's not uncommon at all and while it can lead to lymphoma that's unusual. Usually it's just the disease itself messing with all your glands."

"The saliva glands and the ones under and around my ears are the worst for me. They not only swell they will burn during a major flare. It's so painful. (Blue ice blocks help a lot with that...) Living with this it's like I've got the flu nearly every day. Swollen glands, it's just part of it all."
"I always have swollen lymph nodes in my throat. It's just this new one in my armpit that has me scared. It's about 1 cm, soft and movable. The bad part is that it's only on one side. I never checked my nodes here before. I found this by accident. I wish I had checked in the past so I would have something to compare to. The amount of fear I have isn't normal. I cannot reassure myself with rational thoughts and statistics in my favor. This shows me that I need to get some psychological help too."


Thank-you! I understand your pain!!!! I am still just keeping an eye on that swollen gland. It's not cancer so far so I am relieved. I just wish it would go away though.
"I think you are a rare breed that you can (seemingly) easily recognize your anxiety level needs attention. I know, more often than not, I am unable to recognize that in myself. So huge props for that! As I'm sure you know, some level of anxiety is totally normal with stuff like this. It did sound like yours was interfering with your ability to function."

"Anyways, I am here to ask -- How did things turn out for you?"
"If it helps any I have that all the time. One of my Bartholin glands is also like that. That one drives me a little nuts, but it does seem to just a part of the Sjogren's having some permanent swollen glands here and there."


I had an ultrasound and blood work. All came back normal. I read that nothing is definitive until a biopsy but for now I am satisfied. The swelling is still there and it has just barely enlarged which is a bit concerning but I am back to my old self and not feeling fearful. If it gets much bigger I will go back to my doctor and of course then I will be flipping out again!
"I guess I'll mention since it might not be widely known, but sjogrens makes you more sensitive to the sun and so can plaquenil, which is often taken for sjogrens."
Things that physically block the sun like zinc and SPF rating clothing work best.
Is there a specific place you buy clothes from? I've found a few things on amazon but man they're expensive.
"No I don't. I can give you a list of companies, but I don't prefer one over another."
"Coolibar, whcih has clothes and accessories (hats, umbrellas, sleeves for driving) is having a big end of season sale right now. Other online sources are Solumbra, Sunday Afternoons, Solartex, Eclipse Couture, and SunGrubbies. Also check out sports apparel stores like REI."
"I live in The Valley area of Los Angeles. Pretty low humidity here. Just got my ""official"" diagnosis in December but knew something was wrong for years. On rainy, cloudy days, I had incredible energy and felt fantastic. For at least five years, when it was hot with low humidity, my mouth, throat, eyes and sinuses were parched. It was difficult to breathe. Every joint in my body ached. It's been miserable."

"Now that I know what I have, I have a humidifier next to my bed. If it's really dry out, the humidifier goes to the room I'm in. We're going to get a few more humidifiers but I'm concerned that the moistness might bother my husband's asthma."

"Living with Sjogren's is doable in dry climates but ugh, I feel like a shut in."

"I live in New Mexico. not only is it a desert, it's at 5300 feet so the air is even drier! Right now, we're in the windy season and it is by far the worst time of the year for me. Humidifiers are not a safe option for me because even with frequent cleaning, bacteria and mold are likely to contaminate it; I'm pretty allergic to mold. All I can do to stay comfortable is be reminded to use eyedrops (artifical tears, allergy, and/or Restasis) throughout the day, drink roughly a gallon of water a day, make sure that every beauty or skin care product I own is moisturizing, and accepting that some days, nothing will help."

"I've been formally diagnosed for nearly two years, but had symptoms for five years before that. Plaquenil gave me a dystonic episode, so I'm on methotrexate. It helps keep my lab results normal even though from a subjective perspective, I am doing horribly."
:(  That's about what I guessed.  Thanks for responding!  Best of luck to you and your husband!
pSS here. Sorry about the time you waited before diagnosis. Glad you can address the real problem now. It really does make a difference because with a diagnosis after you get past the scary part of this not being a disease that goes away you can at least address it and help yourself get by!
Real talk. The terrible fatigue of sjogren's remains constant in whatever climate I am in. Only dry mouth and dry eye symptoms are alleviated by moist air.
I'm sorry to hear that :(  May I ask why you don't move to a more suitable climate?
"Partially because my wife likes being within driving distance of her mother, partially because the cost of living here is cheap, and partially because moving would mean having to find a lot of new doctors to manage all of my health issues. I see something like 6 or 7 specialists and take about two dozen pills a day. Only a small part of that is related to my Sjogren's."
"I see, that would be quite a hassle.  Well thanks for sharing and best of luck to you!"
"What is it? A type of cancer I assume? My doctor told me I have a high risk of lymphoma, but I haven't done much research."
"It's a type of lymphoma, that affects certain membrane tissues, most often in the stomach but also in the lungs and other areas.  This one is specifically bronchial tissue.  Sjogren's peeps have a much higher incidence of getting this type of lymphoma."

edit: forgot a word
"Hi there. I'm a 30 year old female who was diagnosed with Sjogren's in December. The dry eye, mental fog, and fatigue sound like they could be pointing towards Sjogren's. Sjogren's can occur alone or along with other autoimmune diseases. This is what I suggest: find a good rheumatologist. Perhaps your GP can make a good recommendation. A rheumatologist is the Dr. that works with Sjogren's and other autoimmune diseases. Review your symptoms and ask to get a lip biopsy done. A lip biopsy was the only definitive test for me that showed I did, indeed, have Sjogren's. I knew something was going on, but my blood work does not carry Sjogren's antibodies, so it can get tricky. Some rheumatologists will treat Sjogren's on the basis of symptoms alone, but I wanted to know for sure. Good luck and hang in there. My heart goes out to you!!"
"Honestly I've been in and out of cardiology and neurology for years. Bloody pain in the bum. My cardiologist was the one to bring up the lip test if I remember but told me I'd be left with almost definite nerve damage from the test? Are you all ""normal"" in the mouth after it? It sounds daft but I'd hate to have my mouth all wonky."

Thanks so much though :) I think have the two similar conflicting potential things - with the migraines that it's blurred any real diagnosis. All the rheumatologists I've seen have looked at the whole picture and said no so to go back again will be very interesting.Thank you!
"It's very possible it's not Sjogren's, of course. I hadn't realized you have gone to see many rheumatologists. Sounds like you've been through the ringer. Ugh."

"From everything that I've heard the lip biopsy is really the gold standard in getting a definitive diagnosis for this. I don't know others experiences with the lip biopsy, but I have no ill effects from it, so I'm a bit confused as to the comment about the nerve damage. In fact I think that my lips right now are the only part of my body that isn't all ""wonky"" :)"
To be honest they've all been happy saying asymptomatic sjogrens but it's this last few years now (and about 3 since I saw a rheum) that I've noticed the symptoms becoming worse. And to be honest when you play them against 50 falls a day the other symptoms didn't compare and Id forget to say them to doctors. Plus they were looking for a blanket condition. Not two. And I can't fault them for that.

Definitely not putting my eggs into one basket.

I'm relieved it's not a horror test! Good lord. I might go ahead with pursuing it then. Thanks for all your advice!
"50 falls a day...wow. That I can't speak to and have no clue, but it makes sense that the other symptoms wouldn't compare and fall by the wayside when speaking with Dr's. Unfortunately, as my GP says, ""You're allowed to have more than one thing wrong."" Best wishes to you for health and healing and if you get a chance, pop back and let me know how all is going."
"I don't have any good feedback for you, other than it sounds like you have severe PMS and I think there is a name for it, but I can't think of it. I suffer from nausea and I do have sjogren's, though I don't know if it is related. I just wanted you to know that I read your post and I hope you get it all sorted out. I also used to get very sick when I had my period--nausea, diarrhea, severe cramps (painkillers wouldn't touch them), etc. It is literally the worst feeling in the world--and I have had kidney stones so I like to joke that I know what ""real pain"" Feels like! I now take birth control that allows me to not have a period, and it is so much better. I really hope you get better."
"I love the genTEAL eye gel for severe dry eye. It makes a damn mess, but it works. I also got some lozenges from my doc at the mayo clinic, but they are available at most drug stores. They are called ""therabreath."" I swear they make me spit so much more. Its helpful, but that sometimes causes my glands to hurt. Its a catch 22 for sure."
"I love genTEAL for nighttime use, but it blurs my vision so badly, I don't use it unless I'm going to sleep. Do you use it during the day, too? Maybe I'm using too much?"

I haven't tried therabreath before. I'll have to check them out! I use xylimelts in my mouth at night. They have an adhesive side that sticks to teeth and take 4-5 hours to dissolve. I use the non-mint ones when I sleep. They really help keep my mouth moist so I don't wake with my cheeks and tongue stuck to my teeth.

Thanks for the suggestions!
"I need to try those xylimelts for sure. When I wake up, my mouth is basically a war zone! I use genTEAL only at night. They make drops that are ok for the day, but they are sooo expensive compared to other brands that are similar--I like the gel drops i think they are called ""blink tears."" I also use rhoto drops all the time cuz they combat redness like no other."
"I use gel drops during the day, too, but I haven't tried blink tears. Thanks for the suggestion!"

"Xylimelts aren't cheap, but I'd rather prevent mouth sores than have to deal with them. I had trouble finding the non-mint ones in stores but drugstore.com has them and if I put them on auto-reorder, there's a discount. I wish more dry mouth products were offered mint-free. Not that I dislike mint, but sometimes it's irritating or too stimulating."


"Have you ever taken cevimeline? I don't know the brand name of the drug, that's the generic name. I take that for my dry mouth symptoms and I find it to be effective. It can be taken up to three times daily and it stimulates saliva production. My symptoms are not as severe as you report but perhaps you could ask your doctor if it would help."
"It's really person-by-person, but we've had some good success with [Oramoist](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=ORAMOIST+disc&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&channel=suggest&gws_rd=ssl) discs."

"Mouth Kote is OK for some people...it's nice because we see fungal mouth infections sometimes and it has xylitol, which is the best fake sweetener for autoimmune and fungal compromised patients."
> cevimeline

Evoxac. I think they stopped US production.
I haven't but I will ask about it next time I go in. I started Plaquenil almost 3 weeks ago and they want to give it a good 2 months to see if it provides any relief. It's hard to wait for what seems like such a long time when there's so much discomfort but I keep having to get my head around this being a long-term thing. There probably aren't any quick fixes. That's tough to come to terms with.
"I tried Oramoist when this first started but was a little put off by the gelatinous texture by morning. However, as I recall, it did last all night though my mouth wasn't quite as dry as it is now. Maybe I'll give it another try. Thank you."

I hadn't heard of Mouth Kote. Thank you for the suggestions!
I still take it in the generic form so they do still make that at least.

I've not had too much trouble with it but I've seen a few ideas floating around. [One of the most popular is to gentle scrub your eyelids with baby soap and a wash cloth.](http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/blepharitis#3)
If you have staph blepharitis you should look at antibiotic wipes and prescription antibiotics
"Another thing you can try is to put argan oil on your eye lashes, it soothes the inflammation and loosens the crusts. Cod liver oil can help increase tear volume. Off label some ppl use wet ones in the red container as an antibiotic wipe."
Elderberry extract helps increase tear flow. Some people dilute GSE and wipe it on the lid margin to act as a mild antibiotic wash
"Have you tried punctual plugs? Its where your eye doctor puts a little plug in your bottom tear duct on each eye to slow drainage. They've allowed me to wear contacts again. I love them. Ill probably just have them cauterized shut whenever the plugs I have now fall out. They generally stay in for a couple  though. They are a little irritating the first few days, but they'll settle into place n you'll forget you have em. DO"
ITTTTT

Do you get those awful clear strings in your eyes? I have SEVERE blepharitis from picking at my eyes constantly for years. Its horrible.
I second this. I used Restasis regularly for about a year and now I just use it on an as needed basis. I have't needed to use it in months.
"I had a prescription for it once, but my insurance wouldn't cover it and so I never filled it."
"I've heard of some people getting cyclosporine from a compounding pharmacy. It's used in veterinary medicine, but I believe they can compound in a manner that is OK for human use. It may or may not be cheaper. Sometimes insurance will cover compounded medication if it's in a strength that won't work for you."

"I got mine through an eye doc too. My copay for it is a little high, but the copay card helps. I've had luck using warm washclothes to help them drain."
I will have to try that. Thanks!
I've been underwhelmed by Biotene's products so I really can't be of much help. Hopefully someone else might have an answer.
"It helped my mild dry mouth but for whatever reason I don't seem to have that symptom anymore so I no longer use Biotene. (I have a rather atypical presentation of Sjogren's, consisting of primarily eye dryness)"
Talk to your dentist about Spry products. The toothpaste tastes much better. Don't know about mouthwash but they have a gum that is really good.
Guaifenesin only thins your mucous secretions (it's a demulcent) so it shouldn't dry you out like speudoephadrine would (was it in there too? or any other decongestant?).
Drink as much water as you can possibly fit in your belly when you're on guaifenesin and you'll thin out and break up any congestion you have. It's fantastic stuff.
Hope that helps.
Hi! I wish her lots of luck on the disability.
"Thanks. We're crossing our fingers. The caseworker she met with this week seemed to think it would be fast tracked because of the pulmonary fibrosis, as they consider it to be an ""end of life"" condition."
Oh wow. That sounds like a lot to deal with.
"It is. But we're all dealing, I think. Her Sjogren's is advanced, but she keeps a sense of humor about it all. She's had two hospital stays this year. She also recently told that she has rapidly advancing cataracts, but they can't do the surgery to correct them until her immune system calms down some. But that could be awhile, and she could be legally blind before the end of the year."

I think a lot of people don't realize how serious and debilitating this disease can be.
Welcome. I'm sorry your Mom is going through all of this. Sjogren's is a nasty disease with many debilitating effects.
I'm glad she has support like you in her life. I would have it a lot harder without family and friends.
"Yeah, it's actually discouraging that even medical professionals don't really even understand."
"Sorry this was stuck in the spam filter.  I've not had mine checked, but I have PCOS as well so my hormones aren't in the best order."
"I haven't had my levels checked, but I (a female) have been on testosterone eyedrops for almost a year now. They help some, but I'm still in really bad eye pain all the time :/"
"Interesting.  I have had low testosterone levels for more than a decade.  Much longer than I've known I've had Sjogren's.  Based on test results, I'm practically female."
"I have had low testosterone levels for as long as I have had Sjogrens and have used testosterone cream, gel  and now the androgen patch on and off over the last 15 years.  I have more energy, and a more positive frame of mind when using a testosterone supplement but still have all my other Sjogrens symptoms."
I'm not sure I understand your terminology...do you mean that people with sjogren's (regardless of sex) have low testosterone?
Did your doc put you on androgel or similar for the low testosterone? If so did it help your SS symptoms?
"There is a correlation between autoimmune disease and low androgen(testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA) levels among both sexes. https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/george-whipple-lab/documents/chang-papers/CV076.pdf"
I don't have problems with my lungs at this point although I do run a low fever all the time now.  That sucks. I got some new information at a physical today too. :/ So much fun stuff. Hugs and chocolate!

"I found this [here](http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/sjogrens_syndrome/): ""Lung problems. People with Sjögren’s syndrome tend to have lung problems caused by inflammation. These conditions include bronchitis (affecting the bronchial tubes) and tracheobronchitis (affecting the windpipe and bronchial tubes). Lung problems are usually caused by white blood cells (lymphocytes) migrating into the lungs and causing a disease called lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. Depending on your condition, the doctor may recommend using a humidifier, taking medicines to open the bronchial tubes, or taking corticosteroids to relieve inflammation."

"Pleurisy, another Sjögren’s-related problem, is inflammation of the lining of the lungs. It is treated with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."""

Thank you Doodlebugboodles!!  You have been such a big help for me and for this sub.  I hope your new info is not too bad.
"The nih site also explains primary/secondary SS much clearer than I've seen else where. I have primary SS. I had always thought I had secondary as I have multiple autoimmune disorders. I will call my pulmonary about the pneumontis tomorrow. Once again, thank you."
"I have sjogren's secondary to a whole mess of weird, unidentifiable autoimmune stuff (my official dx was recently changed to crohn's so that I could start Remicade, this was done in conjunction with multiple specialists at Hopkins, who agree with my local docs, that they don't exactly know WTF I have), anyway...I have had a chronic cough for several years now. It's been somewhat responsive to high dose steroids, but they have no real idea what causes it. It's so bad, that I've broken a rib twice."

"Last year I had a bronchoscopy that was so bad, the doctor said he'd never seen anything like it outside a critical care unit, and they had no idea why i was still breathing, talking, walking, etc. (that's very reassuring, right?) They were unable to get biopsies at that time because i was bleeding too much."

"I just had a follow up bronchoscopy last Friday and am waiting for results. Over the last few months, it has gotten somewhat better, seemingly unrelated to any medication changes."

"My rheum was actually really nervous about starting me on biologics without knowing the exact cause of my cough, but all the other docs felt like it was my best option."

"after the bronch was done, the pulm said ""I bet I know what the report will say...inflammation!!"" (that's all ANY of my tests ever show, even my vasculitis, ""nonspecific""). Grrrr."

"ha, sorry, I realize that was a whole wall of rant. I guess I'm more anxious about getting these biopsy results than I thought!"
Do you have a reason why you run low fever all the time?  Is it a SS thing?  Should I go to one of my doctors?  Learn to live with it (not an option I really like)?
You do realize you are becoming my Shell answer man.  Thank you <3
Hugs and chocolate!!
"No I don't think it's too bad, it explains a few things though."
"You're welcome! Yes, it's a great resource.  I'm going to add that to the sidebar at some point tonight."
Wow! When do you get your results back?
"I believe it's just an SS thing. I can't tell you when to go to the doctor, that's really something you need to figure out.  Learning to live with it is like a topic worthy of a book.  I've had medicine for many of the problems resulting from SS, but after trial and error I've found life easier and better to use less medicine and to ""suck it up"", but that's where you have to decide what you're willing to live with.  You may have better resources than I do or have better doctors and can be more aggressive with it or perhaps the medication works better for you.  I'm happy to help but be sure you do your own research too!  You're welcome!"
"I was hoping today, but no dice. I almost called but they are always good at calling as soon as they know stuff. I am sure ill hear Monday, but if not by afternoon I'm going to call."
Preliminary results say...chronic and accute inflammation. -.-
"Oh,I so agree. I called my pulmonary...got a run around. While I was waiting on them to decide it wasn't their problem, lol,I was researching, reading, moving forward. I have lived on antibiotics since December with no effect. Unless it's debilitating illness, I'm done throwing pills at every symptom. My thanks to you was pointing me to the places to look."
"Oh goodness, so you have to wait the weekend? That would drive me nuts."
Well thank God that's cleared up. /s
"It kinda does me too, but I've been dealing with it so long, And nothing ever really answers any questions, other than to confirm its autoimmune. I guess there is a chance he could call tomorrow but I'd be pretty surprised."
"For real. Some of the cultures take six werks, but I seriously don't expect anything. I missed his call, so I called back to leave a message to ask how it compared to the last one, if he has any more thoughts, plan of action going forward, etc.  to add insult to injury I found out totally by accident that my remicade wasn't delivered for tomorrows infusion, which I would have gone out at 7 am, in the middle of violent storms for. I am sorry for hijacking this thread!"
That stinks. :/. Maybe we should have a general how are you doing thread?
"Ideal place is somewhere on the ocean, southern where it is warmer.  I lived in Arizona and it was great for some of my pain.  I live now in Alabama and pretty much spring and fall is it.  My best is on the gulf coast or southern Florida.  Unfortunately, that isn't an option right now."
"I live in Phoenix, and it's been hell for me (no pun intended).  Only time this Sjogren's seems to go into ""remission"" is when the temp drops below 90.  It's supposed to be 112 today.  We did buy a couple of humidifiers this week.  Have them running 24/7.  It has helped so far.  My lips aren't as dry in the morning, and the nosebleeds have stopped.   This is going to be my last summer here.  Been here for 30 years.  We're considering Oregon."
I don't know.  I think you have a good idea.  I've lived in a number of places and none of them have had climates that are great for SS.  I'm in MO now and I can only spend time outside in the spring and fall.

I'd love to live somewhere very mild may 50-80 F year round with low humidity but dry.
/r/ disabilities
Edit /r/disability Didn't know about the other sub. I do now :-)
"It seems like some of the Sjogren's sub reddit users have also mentioned fibromyalgia, r/fibromyalgia"
Added and fixed.
"Added, thanks!"
I'm not so great at doing this. I do try to drink a glass of water as soon as I wake up and keep one by the bedside every night. I know there are water bottles put out by Flylady that have bands that you move up and down to help keep count of the amount you have drank.
I drink water non stop. I have coffee in the morning but my Brita water bottle is there too. It is filtered in the bottle. I just added up my average day..100 Oz. and still dehydrated.
"I'm horrible with water.  Even worse, I have a horrible Coke habit (as in soda, not Colombian).  I go through a bottle of water over the course of a nights sleep.  Try to drink as much as I can, but I know it's nowhere near enough."
"I was diagnosed with SS about 1.5 years ago and am learning a lot from this site (maybe some things I wish I didn't know!). Anyways, I haven't had to deal with too many symptoms other than dry eyes/mouth and the occasional pain in my joints. I was not aware that hydration was a problem. Could someone explain to me how SS affects hydration?"
I struggle with this too. :/ I've found Whole Foods has 50 oz bottled water and I keep one at my side constantly.  On really bad days I write on them with permanent markers to mark my goals.  I also drink a few glasses of juice a day to mix it up.
I've not seen those water bottles.  I will check them out. Thanks.
I drink between 100 and 125 oz per day - I carry a water bottle with me essentially everywhere (which ends up being a real pain sometimes) and am constantly drinking from it
I added it up and I'm around 82 oz.
I have a soda habit too.  I hate coffee and tea so it's one of the few ways left to get caffeine although I probably shouldn't do caffeine either.
"The best way it was explained to me by a doctor was that I run a quart low. She told me 64 Oz per day and an ounce more per degree over80. I live in the south, that's a lot of water!"
I'm not a medical professional so what I am going to say is my experience. It seems like I need more water to not get symptoms of dehydration. If I get hot it speeds up the process. My guess is that the glands that produce moisture inside the body need extra fluid to function due to the SS.  I have an appointment with my rhuemy next month and I will add that to my question list.
Interesting. Maybe it depends on the person because I haven't felt like I am more prone to dehydration. I do live in Seattle so maybe that plays a part. Who knows?
I appreciate that thank you!
"Peripheral neuropathy, maybe?  It can show up with sjogrens and diabetes.  I believe neurologists diagnose/treat that."
It sounds miserable. :/
I've had issues with neuropathy for the last couple of years.  I've never experienced pain like this.
"It is.  I try to stay away from pain killers as much as possible.  My body got hooked on them a couple of years ago after a spinal surgery.  But, it's getting to a point where I can't do anything anymore.  It seems like I'm getting worse by the day."
I'm sorry you're going through it.  You should probably hit up your doc for answers and treatment.
"I went to a rhuemy apt in 2011 and they put me on a bunch of additional meds to relieve pain and help me sleep.  I didn't feel anything but I was in a horrible fog and although I was unconscious for several hours I wasn't rested at all.  After a few months of really not functioning I threw nearly everything out.  I discovered that the meds were creating new, worse symptoms.  In the end I found living with the pain easier than living with the medication.  Of course your mileage may vary and you may have doctors invested in you getting better. /rant"

Have you been to Mayo?
"My doctor situation is a little different.  My rheumo is under the belief that my SS shouldn't be causing these kind of symptoms.  My neuro can't find anything that my symptoms match up with.  Over the last two years, I've been tested for everything.  MS, Guillain Barre, and every other neurological condition under the sun.  Since June 2009, I've been diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome, PTSD, Fibromyalgia, Type 2 Diabetes, a Chiari malformation, and a massive benign cyst in my brain.  But, none of those things should be giving me the neurological symptoms that I'm experiencing.  It's extremely frustrating.  I think I'm just going to get my medical marijuana card and call it a day. LOL"
"Been to Mayo twice.  The second time, I was hospitalized for six days.  They weren't even able to diagnose me with Sjogren's.  They said I have a ""movement disorder"" that was brought on by stress.  LOL"
"Heh, I've thought about pot too, but I'm so dry and it would just make that worse."

"Sadly, your doctor situation isn't that different.  I've had myself and heard similar stories from others.  It's pathetic really that some of these rheumies are supposedly specialists in our disease, yet know less than most of us about it.  They aren't all bad though.  If any of your doctors are not acknowledging your symptoms, especially symptoms that are likely part of this disease, find another doctor.  While there's no cure, there are treatments that can help manage symptoms."
What is a movement disorder?
"Ha ha.  Never thought about that with the pot.  Hell, I've never smoked, but I already have ""pot lip""."
"That was a generic term they used to explain why I was having seizures and Tourette's tics.  For the last two and a half years, my legs will occasionally just stop working.  It's like someone flips a light switch and I lose control of the bottom half of my body.  It's usually just for a second or two, or for a couple of days."
"[Sjogren's World Forums](http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/) is a great source of information for treatments and coping with symptoms.  I know there's no cure, but there are treatments that make life a lot more tolerable.  If your docs aren't trying new things, find new docs."
"OMFG!  I am right there with you.  I was diagnosed with Sjogren's last September.  I have practically been bedridden since March of 2011.  I've been tested for everything, including Multiple Sclerosis, and have had three unnecessary spinal surgeries.  My rheumatologist is treating the Sjogren's as an inconvenience, not a disability.  For my Sjogren's at least, I have only been prescribed pilocarpine, as a way to get my saliva going.  Yes, I have the dryness issues.  I would kill to get a booger.  I get spontaneous nosebleeds a half dozen times a day.  I've never had a cavity in my life.  I've had six teeth just DIE in the last three months.  My muscles are so weak, I continually have a difficult time walking.  I am constantly in unbearable pain.  I could go on for an hour with symptoms.  It is so incredibly frustrating.  Sorry.  Had to vent."
I completely agree.  I'm uninsured at the moment so I have no idea how serious the internal damage is at the moment and I'm really not sure I want to know.  I'm afraid I don't have any great suggestions.:/
Thank you.  I've been diagnosed for multiple years but have had no treatments outside of eyedrops and mouth moisteners.  I go in next week to my rheumy so hopefully we will try something.
"No, please vent.  I'm tired of getting told my other symptoms aren't SS, but when I talk to other people with SS they have the same problems.  I'm pretty sure I know my own body."
Soft hugs and keep us updated on any new treatments.
"Plaquenil seems to be the usual first drug tried.  It can take up to a year to work.  I didn't have any luck with it, but lots of folks are helped by it.  Don't be afraid to find another rheumy if this one won't help you.  Do you have a pulmonologist?"
Am I able to upvote this multiple times?
I now have a pulminologist. I will see him for the first time the 21st.
I get to my rheumy on the 15th. We have to discuss my Hashimoto's and change meds for that. Then we'll tackle sjogren's. May be one of those appointments where I stand in front of the door until everything is addressed.
"LOL, I would guess that depends on how many accounts you have."
Do you write everything down for talking points for the appointment?  I find I always get flustered and have to have a list or I will forget things.
I write everything down about everything.  I forget so much these days.
That's a great point.  I have all results from specialists sent to my primary care doc and he gives me a stack of medical records to take to new specialists.  It helps keep everyone up to date on what's been done.
"Yes, I do too. It's pretty frustrating."
"Maybe you could ask about being added to the sidebars of /r/ChronicPain, /r/Invisible, and /r/autoimmunity.  I didn't even know this sub existed."
Thanks!  I will check into that tonight.
"I'm here. Likewise disappointed, but here."
I was so hoping for a good sub-reddit.  Autoimmune has Sjogren's as a flair but no one really comments there.
"I have had walking pneumonia five times this year, regular pneumonia twice, pleurisy, Bronchitis, sinus infection.  Help!  I need input from people who have been here, done this.  I have never been this sick."
Hello

oh hey! I just discovered I was modded here.  Well we have to start somewhere. Maybe you could start a thread and we can see where it goes?
"Hey there. Do you have Sjogrens? I was diagnosed back in September. I think mine has been mimicking MS for some time, now. I've been scouring the Web, looking for information, and came across this. You know, there really should be a lot more activity on this subreddit. I don't know who's moderating this thing, but I'm willing to regularly post articles here."
Started something..I hope this sub grows.
"Yep, I've had it for several years.  I know. considering the percentage of people that have it I've been surprised at how empty this is.  I'd love to do more too, I just didn't want to talk to myself :)."
I asked to be placed as a mod on the abandoned subs page. Hopefully it will either get the current mod back or maybe I will get it.
I really hope so too.
"Sleeping on a hard surface without a pillow helps for me, as does making sure to keep my eyes moist with eye drops.  I’ve also heard of wearing swim goggles when doing activities that strain the eyes (to keep them from being exposed to air that dries them out), as that can cause stress that pulls at neck muscles."
"Sjogren's can be diagnosed with one blood test, not sure how much it is there, Thank goodness for the Scottish NHS, no lip biopsy here either. Sensitivity to light is a symptom too. Neck pain is more common especially with so many people using devices & pc's, my neck pain is caused by the above & is made worse by carpal tunnel problems."
Honestly to me it sounds more like tension in the neck pressing on the occipital nerves causing pain. I have that problem. Good luck.
I found out it was dry eye mixed with nerve pain.
"do you drink wine at all? i was able to find relief from the neck pain by visiting a chiropractor and switching to organic/sulfate free biodynamic wine, and eating as organic and preservative free as possible."
This sub is not very active there are a couple of Facebook groups that are a lot better
"Your symptoms could be Sjogrens, although I would suggest further testing. Sicca symptoms could be a sign of other diseases. Did you happen to catch what pattern your ANA was? If it said Speckled, then that makes your odds even higher it’s Sjogrens. Ask to have your SSA and SSB antibodies tested as well. And if you want to be absolutely sure ask for a lip biopsy, this confirmed my diagnosis."

My symptoms started a few years ago with fatigue and GI problems. Then it turned into issues with my nervous system and finally my eyes began to burn/hurt and my mouth was very dry and prone to terrible sores.

"Edit: Also I am always dehydrated! I drink salt water on a daily basis, which helps tremendously with fatigue and constipation. BUT I wouldn’t recommend this unless you talk to your doctor first. I was given the ok to consume 5-10g of sodium a day to increase blood volume."
Links?
"Hello, thank you for responding. It was Speckled 1:80 both times. But I read this can be a insignificant reading? I have fatigue and IBS, but I also have anxiety and depression and whenever I go to the doctor it always just gets dismissed as just symptoms of my mental health...but when I tie it all together it all seems to by systemic :/"
just type sjogrens in the facebook search bar
"I also have Speckled 1:80 and was told the same thing. Apparently something like 25% of women can have a false positive ANA at 1:80. I had a feeling it was too coincidental that I felt like I had Sjogrens and my ANA was speckled. I went against my original Rheumatologists advice and got a lip biopsy done anyway, positive for focal lymphocytic sialadenitis."

If you feel like something is wrong you are most likely right. If you feel you have Sjogrens don’t hesitate to look further or get a second opinion. You know your body.
"Do you mind me asking, since getting a diagnosis,  has it helped? Are there many treatments that you have found helpful?"
"It really depends on your symptoms, because the treatment is mostly management. I do feel much better than I did at the time of my diagnosis. I thought I’d have to go on disability and lose my job, but now I’m back to working full time."

"I recently started Cevilemine and it has changed my world. It may not have the same effect for everyone, but it has helped my salivation and stopped my painful mouth sores. It also has helped me sweat more, my eyes are less dry and my constipation is improved."

"I also take plaquenil, but I don’t know how much that’s helping. Maybe a little with the fatigue."

If you suffer from autonomic dysfunction like me then salt is your best friend. When I got my diagnosis and learned it caused blood pressure issues I was able to treat it by increasing my sodium. This has been the most effective management for me and I believe greatly improved my ability to function. I was always dizzy and had trouble standing.
"Don't sweat it, it's most likely temporary."

"I'm in the process of getting diagnosed but it seems like formality really - I've had symptoms for a decade, it only just clicked recently. Before I get diagnosed, I've been implementing some changes into my diet to reduce inflammation - cut out pro-inflammatory omega 6s that I used to eat tons of, started taking lots of omega 3s, reduced lectins to a huge extent."

"I had a terrible flare this winter - that's what finally made me do some research and connect the dots - and my nose was one big inflamed wound (sorry for TMI) for 5 months. After making these changes it's back to normal. Well it's dry like it had been for years now, but I don't need to use emolient creams 5 times a day to be able to breathe (they by no means made the dryness go away anyway, to be honest), what a fucking relief."
"Mine does! Hang in there! My ENT has me use a mild salt water rinse, and Biotene rinse and well as Biotene toothpaste have been a major help to me. I know it's pretty awful, and you you can feel like you are choking, but staying calm thru that really helps, I drink coke when I eat during a flare up, for some reason, for me at least it's the best thing I've found to help the food feel comfortable in my mouth and with with swallowing."
"Hi, houdini."
"I am new to this as well, but I've been on an anti-inflammatory diet (no sugar, no wheat, very limited dairy, very limited soy) for 8 wks.  I've definitely seen some saliva function return during that time.  (My dental hygienist noticed as well.)"
thanks! It came on so suddenly it's pretty crazy. Last week this time I wasn't even thinking about it!
"The only one out of the list that is a problem, is the sugar. I haven't done Dairy for years, Eggs it's been many many years, Soy I can only handle a little and that is like soy sauce, or other things used as a sauce. But to eat the beans or drink soy milk, nope no way. I am have no problems with eating gluten free foods, but I miss my crackers, and other things that are quick snacks or quick throw in the oven pizza. I keep thinking I'll get better with the gluten one day."
"My nutritionist said, ""Sugar is inflammatory, body fat is inflammatory, stress is inflammatory."""

Weird to think I might never have another Coke as long as I live.  I loved it so much!  I made banana bread for my folks last wknd and couldn't taste it.  They said it was excellent.
"I hope to be the way you are one day. But I need to do things one step at a time. I don't know that I could ever cut out sugar totally, but to cut out soda pop, and a lot of sweets, sure I already can do that. My sweets I do with gluten free flour, but it still has sugar. And I love my pancakes but I only use real maple syrup, I need to start using honey for my tea. I just don't know if it really is any better for my body like some people in my area are telling me.  Good luck with your Coke. You really aren't missing much, maybe it's me, but the flavor has gone down hill. Not nearly what it used to be."
One step at a time sounds great!

"Yeah, the nutrition stuff is confusing to me, as well.  Maybe some of these things actually \_aren't\_ inflammatory for me?"
"Nope, never even heard of that."
"No, but there is the common denominator of imflammed lymphnodes in both of them."
I’ve not heard of Kikuchi’s disease. What is it?
"Kikuchi disease, also called histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis or Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, is a disease that affects the lymph nodes, causing lymph node inflammation. Sometimes mistaken for lymphoma. The exact cause of the disease is not yet known, although some researchers have suggested it is an infection or autoimmune disorder."
Tears due to emotions have different substances in them than tears to lubricate your eyes. I can cry the majority of the time and definitely have Sjogren's. I don't know about the ANA titer. I think the true test is a lip biopsy.
"I can totally still cry and definitely have Sjögren's. I tear up a little when my allergies or bad or when I'm sick, too."

"It's kind of a good thing I can still cry, when my eyes are super dry I watch really sad videos to force myself to make tears. Lol"

I don't think ANAs are definitive. Even if you have positive ANAs they will still want to do a lip biopsy to prove it's Sjögren's specifically.
"I can still cry though it's physically painful. My bloodwork clearly showed sjogren's, but not everyone's does. So, like others said, ask for the lip biopsy."
"I can cry buckets, have a clear ANA, and don't have the sjogrens specific autoantibodies. I definitely have sjogrens though, it was diagnosed via lacrimal gland biopsy."
I produce tears from crying and definitely have Sjogren's. I was diagnosed based on positive SSA  or SSB (I don't remember which) blood test result so my rheumatologist didn't require lip biopsy.
"My eyes are so dry that contact lenses fuse to my eyeballs within hours and I still have tears. Same with my mouth, bone dry unless I’m eating certain things and then my saliva flows."
"My tear production decreased a lot a couple years ago and I was so depressed that I might lose the ability to cry. Once I started using lubricating eye drops though, I can now actually get a tear that’ll roll down my face. It makes me so happy to feel tears now that I cry tears of joy while I’m crying haha. Before the eye drops, my eyes would tear up but none would fall and it would also hurt...like sharp pains in my eyelids. If you’ve been using eye drops, that may be helping you with your tears. And I think some people just don’t have a problem regardless 🤷🏻‍♀️ My ANA has been fine so far, although I’m waiting for new results, and my SSA and SSB are fine. My rheumatologist diagnosed me solely based on symptoms, because I’ve had symptoms for many years and a variety of them."

"How is your thyroid? Mine is fine, but I have heard of some people having dry eyes and mouth with that. Also, if your estrogen is low, that can mess with these things too. Even though my doc insists I have SS, I’m still somewhat in denial and hope that I don’t actually have it."
"There are 3 different types of tears, containing different compounds, the ones affected by SS are the ones important to maintenance of lubrication of the eye surface. Crying tears/emotion tears are a different type of tear, and reactive tears, such as those produced in response to onions/fumes are the 3rd type of tear."
That helps thank you!
Lol! I can definitely relate to making yourself cry. I've done that on more than one occasion haha
Thank you so much! I'll definitely do that
Did you test positive for SSA and SSB?
"Thank you so much. This gives me hope. It's sad to want to have sjogrens but the alternative is worse imo. Having chronic fatigue syndrome means no cure, no treatment, and people think you're just lazy."
That helps
Thank you!
Ouch! My mouth is definitely the same. Forget about eating a cracker without water!
"Yes, and also the rheumatoid factor if I remember right. It's been a couple of years."
Happy to help. Lip biopsy isn't always required. See if you can get diagnosis based on SSA / SSB blood test before subjecting yourself to biopsy. Good luck!
"No doubt! I’m on autoimmune paleo (got 8 other disorders) so I eat mostly fruit and veg and a meat now. I use a lot of yogurt and applesauce or I just can’t get my food down unless it’s really high water content. Another thing I learned recently is that saliva pre-digests your food, so if you eat slow and chew more, til your food is smaller, you help with things like bloating and the burps. Just thought I’d share."
Good to know! That biopsy doesn't sound fun. Lol. Thank you!
Interesting. I knew that saliva pre digests food but I never thought of using it to my advantage.
"Life changing med for me. A lot of saliva within 20 minutes of taking it, and I take it again in 5 hours. Used to have the added side effect of tear production, too, but that stopped for me last spring for some reason. If you find it doesn't work for you, try the name brand, Evoxac. If those don't work, you can try the brand name alternative, Salagen, or its generic, pilocarpine."
I take it and noticed an improvement right away.  I don’t experience any side effects that I can notice.  I also take generic ranitidine.  Both have helped me greatly.
Thank you
I had a malignant salivary gland tumor - did you see anyone about this? Could it be stones? Have you tried sour hard candies to draw them out?
Were your eyes dry as well or was it just your tumor that was causing your dryness? Did your blood site any markers for SS?
"I had Sjogren's long before I had cancer and have it now even though I'm NED. I was officially diagnosed because I had a flare during radiation treatment. I have not been tested for SS, but I'm a textbook case. They state that the tumor was unrelated to my autoimmune issues, so take that as you will."

"Salivary stones are very common for Sjogren's and people have different techniques to remove them. Have you seen anyone, are you getting any answers? Why would you have simultaneous swelling on both sides?"

&#x200B;

"I forgot to answer your other question- yes my eyes were chronically dry and I had systemic, arthritic pain. I manage my SS with diet and exercise now and am mostly symptom free except for stress-related flares."
"Hi litchick, thanks for taking the time to reply, much appreciated!"

This isn't my normal account so I hadn't seen this until now.

Glad to hear you're mostly symptom free! Great work with that :)

&#x200B;

"So I've been on a fast track with the NHS (UK) since May, but have had no real answers. So far I know the swellings are 'sialadenitis'. There has been no mention of stones throughout the process."

Sarcoidosis was suggested but has been all but ruled out after tests.

"Sjogren's syndrome is the most recent suggestion but to have that without any dryness of the eyes or mouth seems very unlikely from my research. However it would explain the symptoms, given that 'autoimmune sialadenitis' can present in a similar manner to what I have."

I was meant to have a biopsy last week but the radiograper declined to carry it out as she believed it would do more harm than good. I was incredibly disappointed as I believed a biopsy was my best chance for an answer. I've also been bounced around various incorrect departments without seeing an ENT specialist.

I made a complaint to the hospital and have have managed to secure an ENT appointment next week.

"I haven't got much hope for that, I think they'll tell me to see how it goes seeing as it's not causing me and major issues."

"Anyway, will let you know :)"

Enjoy your week in the meantime!
"Yeah, definitely keep me updated, pm me if you want. Hope you are doing hot compresses, hoping some antibiotics will clear you up - I can't believe you haven't seen an ENT yet. Get well soon!"
"I tried it more for brain fog than fatigue. It did help with both. However, even if I took it at 7:00 am I couldn't fall asleep until 3:00 am the next day, so I had to stop. All stimulants, even caffeine, do this to me, though."
I’ve used both Provigil and Nuvigil and it helped me get through some rough times when first diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  Used it only when though needed since dependency is a concern.   It was expensive and hard to get through my insurance.  That why I’ve used both.  Which ever one I could get approved at the time is the one I used. That was in 2007/2008 so hopefully it’s better now.
"I did my biopsy in January and it's still healing. My lip is still kind of numb close to the incision but it's much better than before. It turns out I do have sjogren, which means that it will take longer for things to heal."
"While I have no experience with a planned sleep schedule like you mean, my diabetes and its related med equipment wakes me up nightly, and the lack of good sleep is killing me. Based on that, I wouldn't recommend."
My mother was undiagnosed with lupus and Sjogrens when she was pregnant with my brother and later with me. My brother was a healthy baby that grew into a (as far as we can tell) healthy adult. I had juvenile arthritis and now have Hashimotos and Sjogrens.

"I will never put a baby at risk of having any of my disorders. I was loved, and my parents got me the best medical care they could, but being a chronically ill child sucks. It's just not a gamble I'm willing to take, even if I felt healthy enough to carry."

"Just something to consider. If it's something you're really committed to, I wish you a healthy pregnancy and baby. Definitely find a doctor you trust because even a healthy pregnancy can be hard on your body."
I had this and my baby was fine. I did need to get his heart monitored more often than usual and the dr casually said if they found a heart problem they could go in and operate on the baby while he was in my stomach 😳. My baby was fine and totally healthy though.

"And, I get all the blood tests confused (I also have lupus) but this one may also be the one that causes the clotting factor thing that can cause miscarriages."
I think the occurrence for that is way more common.

"So, be sure to check with your Dr before you get pregnant or asap if you are!  I think there are medicines you can take to help drastically lessen the clotting miscarriage chances."


Get a high risk pregnancy doctor. You will definitely need to be monitored.
I have a friend who has actually given birth to 2 healthy babies. A boy and girl. She had Sjögren’s and is positive for SSA
"Only. She was worried about her pregnancy as well but from what I remember she had a pretty normal pregnancy, both times."

"Personally, I’m age 34 and don’t want kids. I’m having so many health issues and haven’t been able to even support myself yet! Still relying on my parents financially because I am not able to hold down a job always calling in sick."
"I have my fur babies and that will have to be good enough, lol! I don’t really have the desire to have a child though either."
"I have Endometriosis as well as Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism,"
"So the odds are a bit stacked against me from the get go anyways. I’ve had two surgeries for Endometriosis so far, and I know it’s the #1 cause of infertility in women."
Thank you for sharing this and for your honesty.
"Thanks so much for taking the time to share this.  Wonderful you gave birth to a healthy baby!  I don't have an appointment with my rheumatologist for a while, so I really wanted to learn of others' experiences."
"Yup, that’s what my rheumatologist has told me should I ever become pregnant. He’s adamant about it."
Glad to hear it went well with your friend. Hope your condition improves.
"And sorry if I came off as trying to scare you. That wasn't my intention. Women with autoimmune disorders have healthy babies all the time, like my older brother. Just saying that things can go either way and that one must be mindful of any possibility."
"Possibly referring to levels of those antibodies in your blood.  At my lab, normal levels of both Sjogrens Syndrome A and B antibodies are < 1.0.  If your results are describing levels of Sjogrens Syndrome antibodies, then your levels would be out of range meaning you tested positive for those antibodies.  I think."
That could make sense. Thank you!

I forgot to take it once at night and the next day had such bad fatigue I had to stay in bed all day. Felt like a bad flare-up. Not sure if it was related but it kind of seemed to be.
"I have nausea and migraines everyday. I think it's the Sjogrens. I wake up with such a terrible headache, and facial pain sometimes to the point it makes me nauseous. On those mornings, moist heat is my savior!"
"Same here. I've even gone several days without it with no noticeable changes. I can get nausea and migraines anyway, so I would never connect that with missed doses personally."

"When I first got on plaquenil it took quite a while to take effect. Like, weeks to months? I imagine that it's something similar to *stop* having an effect, not like a few hours."
Idk if this helps because I still don’t know enough about it myself but: my rheumatologist gave me an “early Sjögren’s panel” blood test that looks for biomarkers seen in Sjögren’s. It can apparently detect these biomarkers way earlier than other tests - they often show up before ANA or SSA or SSB do in early stages of Sjögren’s. I tested positive for a few of these biomarkers but still haven’t talked to my rheum about it yet. I’ll see them Monday.

"I’ve done a lot of research on it and it seems that this test is often a good indicator, but it’s not necessarily diagnostic and other tests are necessary (Schirmer test, salivary flow test, often a salivary gland biopsy - combined with an analysis of symptoms) for a true diagnosis."


Yeah you definitely want the SSA and SSB blood tests. Also recommend you get your ANA retested every 6 months because it can change.

"Also, in addition to bloodwork, you can have biopsies done of tissue in your mouth as well as various eye tests for dryness."
"I don't test positive for anything. ANA is negative, SSA and SSB related antibodies are also negative consistently. I was diagnosed about 3 years ago and I would consider myself having a severe case of primary Sjorens. From what i've been told, diagnosis is no longer dependent upon positive antibodies being present. Unlike some related disorders of Lupus and RA, those almost always present positive antibodies and is usually required before a diagnosis is made."
"I second this. There is a test called the Schumer that the eye doctor can perform. It takes less than 2 minutes. They add droplets into your eyes, and then measure the dry patches that form as your tears drain. My eye doctor detected dryness, my dentist also detected dry mouth during my cleaning visits."
"How were you diagnosed? I was told to even get a referral to rheumatology, much less a diagnosis, that tests indicating an autoimmune disorder were required."
"My insurance doesn’t require referrals. My primary initially tested me and then recommended I see a rheumatologist to see if she could do additional tests. Hers were also negative, but when she examined me, there was no doubt in her mind."
"I make sure I get enough sleep, I eat Well, and drink a ton of water. Hydration is super important. I take a hot shower and soak every night"
Carnivore diet. Look up /r/zerocarb .

"Mtcd, gout and Sjögren here. Can live normal life if I just stick to meat + water diet. I do have cheat days around once in 2 weeks. Highly recommend trying out."
"Have a discussion with your rheumatologist. Right now, my symptoms are better controlled through diet medications and lifestyle. Diet, I do gluten free, low dairy (milk is okay but no cream or cheese products), low sugar (fruit and natural sugars are okay but minimize cakes cookies etc), and less processed foods. Meds, I am on plaquenil and imuran (both immunosuppressants). Lifestyle, I plan to spread out my activities. Days I work mean I won’t cook, or do anything but veg out for the rest of the night. One day to recover after working, and only two social things in a week (preferably not back to back). If I push myself too much, there will be a flare up, so balance is key."
Yesss I do all this hard core good to see it’s helping you too
I’ve definitely heard of this and thought about it...ill give it a go thanks!
"Do you have Imuran soley for sjogren's, or is it prescribed for another autoimmune disease?"
"Why those dairy’s? And why natural sugars? I do Keto a lot of the time. How do the meds work for you, that’s what I’m most interested in. And the taking breaks very smart I try for that too"
"Sjogrens, because it has proceeded to affect my lungs and esophagus/GI tract and joints. As of right now, I test negative for any other autoimmune disease (though I personally have my doubts)."
"Just slowly correlated certain foods with symptoms. At first, I felt awfully bloated with breads and pizza. Slowly realized things with wheat didn’t sit well but rice etc was okay, so I went gluten free. But I would still have trouble with anything cheese heavy, which sucked even more bc I love cheese. Cut it out though (except for a little parm here and there). Also noticed trouble with foods that had heavy cream, but milk with my tea has so far been okay. So cut out most dairy except the milk (and butter). Then I realized I still felt awful if I ate too much sugar (cakes cookies etc), but fruit was okay. I still have sugary things in moderation, but I’m very strict about it. And as a result of all of these restrictions, I don’t eat anything processed. I basically follow a paleo style diet. I considered the autoimmune protocol but the primary food they eliminate are nightshades, which makes up the majority of my diet."

"The meds I have not been on long enough to give you a complete answer. The plaquenil I did not notice a difference. The imuran made me feel slightly better, but then I started having vocal cord dysfunction (unrelated to the meds) so it’s very hard to tell. I am hopeful though."
"I haven't been diagnosed yet but I'm trying - I think my lungs and GI tract are affected - I've struggled to eat for about 8 months now and lost significant weight. My primary doesn't know about Sjogren's and I just discovered it a couple weeks ago during a visit to my dentist where more cavities were discovered! So I'm just curious if your symptoms were similar to mine. I get nauseated while eating and then it pretty much lasts for an hour or so. But that only happens every few meals - not every time. Every time I eat, I am Thanksgiving-full after just a small amount of food and I become short of breath. I also sometimes get heart palpitations. Is that similar to you?"
My doctor had me try Nexium and that actually sent me to the ER and made it impossible for me eat anything solid for over a week. I've had a CT and an endoscopy with no abnormalities found.
Yes that’s similar to me. You can do a motility study to see if there’s a problem w swallowing and a stomach emptying study to see if there’s gastroparesis.
cipro is a VERY dangerous drug as are all the flouroquinolones. I had a bad reaction after one dose. If you have MTHFR I hear you are likely to have these reactions but could also be its just plain dangerous. Look up FLOXED - all people damaged from this class of antibiotic.
I just took cipro a few months back and did not have any reaction. Sorry to hear she went through all of that!
That is terrifying!  have been taking Cipro frequently for years and I've never had a bad reaction.
"I was just reading about myasthenia gravis and the potential for problems taking antibiotics. Not saying that is her problem, just that some relationship between autoimmunity and antibiotics does exist."
"My doctor said they’d like to try cymbalta with me but I’m scared of starting those ”hardcore drugs”. Today I picked up my first bottle of LDN, I really hope it would help so I don’t need to start using others. I’ve suffered about seven years using just natural remedies, besides triptyl. Now I’m at a point where I can’t survive without proper medicine anymore."

What kind of side effects has cymbalta given you?
Exercise intolerance? Could you explain what you mean?
"Can you tell me more about your dental work? I'm really scared of getting dentures and having teeth pulled, I guess it's a vanity issue to me. I am having a lot of cavities pop up and have had a lot of crowns in the last year."
I honestly haven’t had any. But my heart rate is always faster and I know that one of the side effects was possibly slowing the heart rate which my doctor didn’t really worry about for me. The only issue I have with it is that now that I’m awake a bit more I’m noticing my body fatigue more. I wouldn’t give up the cymbalta it’s made a big difference for me.
"I had a test run when I was a teenager because I couldn’t seem to keep up at dance class. My body seems to reject exercise. The way they explained it to me was if I walk up a flight of stairs my body thinks I walked up 3-4 instead. But I was also told if I become a couch potato that will be it. So I’ve tried to keep moving, but recently the body fatigue is crippling."
"This is generally an autonomic issue. I would see a specialist in that field. I suffer from severe autonomic symptoms, so I hear you. I'm waiting on a September consult."
"Yes, Sjogren's can cause dysautonomia and autonomic neuropathy that can effect your heart. It has for me."
I have tachycardia and light and variable pots. You need to see an autonomic neurologist for proper evaluation bc regular neuros don’t have all the equipment. If you have nervous system involvement some insurers will pay for ivig which sometimes reverses neuro issues. Otherwise it’s drug intervention. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stim is a possibility to heal or improve autonomic function but it’s not widely available yet. It is being used for RA by some rheumies but doubt insurance covers.
"You can suppress tachycardia with beta blockers, and I imagine they'd do something with sodium for bradycardia, but it's mostly just treating the symptoms."
"Is there anything to be done about that? Has it led to more serious problems, if you don’t mind my asking?"
"Sometimes, yes. It's like my salivary glands are squeezing to work or something. It happens to me when I'm about to eat something tasty and my mouth wants to water. It's brief, but painful."

Is that what you are experiencing?
"Yes, I used to get this a lot, pretty much before eating anything but particularly sour/bitter things. My Dr showed me how to massage the sides of neck, just behind the jaw to help production of saliva and that helps when it's painful."
"I get it in the jaw muscle from especially tart foods, but only on the first bite.  I don't think it's necessarily a SS thing, as I've heard others describe it.  I just don't have the words for what's happening, so it's hard for me to ask other people about it."
Yea! I've been getting it more and more lately.
"Have you tried salivary gland massage? I'm able to get mine to express some gunk from mine, and then I have better flow. If you aren't well hydrated, that could potentially exacerbate the issue, too. Either way, it's a drag. I hope that it improves for you!"

Edit: I just realized that someone else mentioned the gland massage. Sorry for the redundancy!
"Lip biopsies for Sjögren's Syndrome are done on the inside of the lip because it needs to be salivary tissue, so... I'm sorry,  but not quite sure why you think that this sub would be helpful. It sounds like your procedure was quite different."

"That said, I hope that I'm wrong and that someone has helpful advice. I'm sorry that this happened to you."
That’s crazy and I’m sorry this happened to you. Who did your original incision/biopsy?

"Anyone else reading this post though, I hope this doesn’t scare you off from doing a biopsy. Something like this sounds quite rare. For example mine was done by a dermatologist, on my lower lip, and was closed with just two stitches and no residual scarring. This was about a month ago."
"I'm just looking for any ideas for healing a lip scar, and it seems like the only other people who have had lip biopsies are sjogrens patients."
"It was a dermatologist who ordered the biopsy. The doctor who performed the actual biopsy was another dermatologist who supposedly specializes in biopsies and other skin surgeries. I wanted to ask the doctor what to do about the scar when it still hadn't healed a few months later, but he didn't have any free appointments, so I saw a different dermatologist who does biopsies at the same hospital. He said he could give me a shot of cortisone into the scar tissue. I declined, because I read a few horror stories about cortisone injections leaving indents in the skin."
"That’s crazy, I’m sorry it didn’t work out for you. I don’t know what could be done about it now other than seeing plastics."
"I agree, plastic surgeons can make scars look a lot better. I'd do it if it bothers you."
"definitely go see an ophthalmologist.  you need to use eye drops several times a day.  Also, they make a ""gel"" for night use that lasts longer.  Also when I had a flare-up, dr put me on steroid drops for a few weeks and that helped.  Good luck!"
"Have you seen an ophthalmologist?  This should be done in parallel to get a Shirmer Test and see if there are signs of dryness and discuss what can be done.  Go after the symptoms with a plan, don’t wait and suffer.  Until then, try Thera Tears or other preservative free eye drops."

Edit: also forgot to add hot compresses.
"In addition to what u/DannyTannersFlow said, the ophthalmologist should also do a tear break up time (TBUT) test to see how quickly your tears evaporate. If you find Thera Tears and preservative free eye drops (in vials) are not sufficient, you can also use eye gel drops, and at night you can use eye gel. The ophthalmologist may also offer prescription eye drops - usually Restasis or Xildra.  Using a humidifier to add moisture to your environment can also help. And try to remember to blink more often than usual."
"Good suggestions here for eye drops and definitely see an Opthalmologist every year from now on. I also find that increasing healthy fats in my diet helps my sicca symptoms, so I take sea buckthorn supplements and eat a lot of avocados, coconut oil."
Ketotifen fumarate eye drops changed my life! They are essential for me.
I will have to look into the gel options. Where can you buy those?
Thank you. I am a little lost right now and never even thought to make an appointment with an opthamologist. Thank you for your suggestions.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you. Where can I get this type of drop?
any drugstore
"Most drug stores or stores with drugstore sections. Zaditor and Alaway make it, and the store brands work just as well."
When I take doxycycline my dry eye is almost completely eliminated. You're not alone.
"Not heard of  antibiotics making you feel better before. I generally try & avoid taking them because of the huge risk of antibiotic resistant infection. The last time I had any was 7 years ago when I had whopping cough, which I think is what started my sjogrens in the first place. Interesting to see what others think."
"Funny coincidence but I just ran across this interesting article today. It speculates on a link between autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's and bacteria that cause Vitamin D dysregulation, which can be reversed with subinhibitory antibiotics. https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04637.x"


"Obviously, this is just a research paper but there very well may be some connection between antibiotics, gut bacteria, and autoimmune diseases."
https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/35011/sjogrens-antibodies-anti-ss-a-anti-ss-b  Aparently there is a Sjogren specific test.  Curious to see if rheumatologist included that one or. It.  Will see
"This is based on the Marshall Protocol. You can look it up online and there is a forum for it. I did it when I had Lyme disease after IV abx failed. - my Rheumy used it in a lot of his patients. You have to avoid Vit D for the. duration and it potentiates. the specific abx used. Also the [ROADBACK.org](https://ROADBACK.org) recommends ABX for autoimmunity also believing there are stealth. intracellular infections at work. I think for some this is precisely what is happening but I think for some we have a heavy toxic burden: mercury, elevated copper aluminum etc. These most def cause immune reactions and Drs. gloss over their toxic effects.  My symptoms began although. quite light compared to now after mercury amalgams were placed. I think these ABX protocols are worth testing. It is easy to gauge if you are improving. Obviously ABX are not great for good flora but if you have one of these intracellular infections they need to be addressed.  There is no easy way to test for them aside from taking these abc and testing your response. YOu will either have a herxheimer reaction or feel better. If you have autonomic neuropathy this also will be a key piece to FIX and heal as well - the only thing I see as helping that is Vagus nerve stimulation and its not widely used yet for AI. Gammacore has a device for RA and have done one study on Sjogrens that improved fatigue."
Thanks for the feedback.   My doctors are strong disagreement with each other on this point.
">Obviously, this is just a research"

Wow awesome! Thanks so much

I sent this to the doctor

He said Nancy Carteron [https://health.usnews.com/doctors/nancy-carteron-523448](https://health.usnews.com/doctors/nancy-carteron-523448)

has a book that goes into this theory

&#x200B;

Apparently he has had his own experiences with patients as well.
[http://autoimmunityresearch.org/preprints/WaterhouseAnnals2009Preprint.pdf](http://autoimmunityresearch.org/preprints/WaterhouseAnnals2009Preprint.pdf)

Found the full PDF of the article.
"I have vit d deficiency and what i and my drs thought was fibromyalgia. Then i spent today in AE after 4 days of dry eyes that made my eyes so painful that i went to get checked. Sorestiff neck muscles, blurred vision and cracking low voice due to dry throat issues. All this going on for over a year. All the pieces are coming together. Looks like Sjogren's. Will know more when i see the ophthalmologist. Maybe it's both fibromyalgia and Sjogren's. I seem to be getting good at collecting chronic illnesses."
"No tips for NHS specifically, but I would list all of the symptoms to your rheumatologist and push for a salivary gland biopsy. That’s the definitive test for Sjogrens, which it sounds like a strong possibility given your symptoms. However, there isn’t really a Sjogrens specific treatment. It is mostly treated symptomatically - punctual plugs for dry eyes, mouth washes for dry mouth, etc."
"My GP did a blood test & confirmed that there were anomalies. The test results were emailed to our local rheumatology department, because of my blood work I was given an appointment. When I saw the consultant, he asked me loads of questions & a physical exam. Then he gave me the diagnosis, he said there was no need for anymore tests because of my symptoms. That's from the NHS in Scotland, I know there's differences in the different countries."
"try going to doctors in the same clinic or hospital, and try to find a GP there too that will advocate for you and collaborate with those doctors. it really, really helps when everyone can talk to each other easily. good luck!! you deserve to figure out what's going on."
"I understand why you're worried - I have anxiety, and would be crawling with nerves all weekend in your shoes!"

"However, I don't think it's fair to be ""super pissed"" at your rheumatologist. Doctors are taught that it's usually best to deliver serious news in person, because they are better able to communicate everything about the diagnosis and prognosis to the patient in that context. Seeing you in person also helps them better gauge (and react to) your emotional reaction to whatever news they are sharing."

"There are good reasons for doing this sort of thing in person, although doctors should definitely keep in mind that waiting for an appointment can also be extremely nerve-wracking for the patient, as you are now experiencing. But your doctor isn't doing this to be unkind or difficult; she is doing what she was taught, and she was taught to do this because there are very real benefits to both providers and patients. These are just the current norms in medical practice."

"If I were you, I would (a) call first thing tomorrow, explain that you're feeling very anxious about this, and ask if there is any way they can squeeze you in on Friday instead of Monday. And (b), try my damnedest to remember that ""serious news"" may be something as simple as reviewing several very different treatment/management options with you for a totally treatable issue."

"Good luck, I hope you get good news soon!"
Hey there. Checking in to see how your appointment went today.
"Turns out I have the lupus anticoagulant factor. Basically means I am at more risk for dvt, pe blood clots, heart attack, stroke. High risk for miscarriages. Sucks bc I have migraine and the only thing that makes it stop is being on the pill, which puts me at further risk for the above. Have to go to a hematologist for more info. Rheumy said I may be able to go on a blood thinner and stay on the pill. Because I have PCOS and am at high risk for endometriosis, OB said when I come off the pill I should strongly consider a hysterectomy due to my specific situation. It’s all a lot to take in."
"Didn’t plan on having bio kids anyway- I also have the factor for possible heart block and neonatal lupus, and genetic issues in family, but of course this reignited my convo about this with my MIL. I’ll save that for JUSTNOMIL though."
It’s just a lot on top of other bad news.
"Well that's a lot to take in. The ladies over at r/lupus are helpful and might have some input for you regarding all of that (well, except the MIL part which is a whole different issue, gah!). There was recently a thread about BC. https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/agxbmt/birth_control_and_lupus/"

Hopefully it will all be manageable. Just because the risk is higher doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.
"Doctor #1 put me on low dose azathioprine to treat lupus (pre-Sjogren's diagnosis) and I had no side effects. Due to concerns about increased lymphoma risk, doctor #2 in new state after interstate move had me go off to see how I did without it so I've been off it for years now."

What symptoms are you trying to address and what treatments have you tried so far?
I just started taking it yesterday because I can’t tolerate plaquenil. I have felt a little more spaced out and have had a headache. I hope these side effects dissipate.
"I've developed inflammatory arthritis in every joint below the neck. Never experienced anything like it before. Scans confirmed is not RA developing, just pSS symptoms. NSAIDs don't help. I was given a steroid injection to bring me out of it. If it's not there once the injection wears off then it was just a flare then I wont need to add anything, if it's still there then I need meds to control it..."
"Ay, that sounds very uncomfortable."

I'm wondering why your rheumatologist isn't offering to try plaquenil first (after steroid). That's usually the initial treatment option for Sjogren's and lupus. It pretty much eliminated my joint pain when I was on it. Went from not being able to hold my tea cup and having to switch computer mouse back and forth between hands to no problem within a couple of weeks of starting the med. Maybe ask about that instead if you need to move on to meds after steroid.

"Also, you might want to try an elimination diet to see if you are eating foods that cause inflammation. Going low to now sugar and carbs is key but there's also other food to know about. Research anti-inflammatory diet to add some food to your diet, reduce or eliminate others and see if that helps."

"Another thing you may want to try is curcumin which is the part of tumeric that helps reduce inflammation. I'm no longer on meds for Sjogren's (other than evoxac for saliva) or lupus and find taking NatureWise curcumin 2250, 1 capsule in the morning and another at night, helps to reduce or eliminate my joint pain. That brand gets a lot of positive reviews from auto immune people on Amazon."
"My gf also tested negative for celiac, but this is identical in symptoms for when she accidentally eats wheat. Just because you are suggested to ""carry on as normal"" doesn't mean you should listen to them! I'd suggest removing all wheat from your diet for 30 days and see if it helps you feel better in general."
"I think IBS is fairly common in Sjogren's, as well as gastroparesis. I have similar symptoms and am just about ready to finally see a doctor about it."
"Hey, I also tested negative for Celiac’s but when I got inflammation blood testing done I came up *highly* reactive to gluten and dairy (and also some weird things like garlic and strawberries lol). As someone with an autoimmune disorder you are predispositioned to have inflammatory responses to things like gluten!"
"Thank you all, I’m hoping tomorrow I feel better but looking at what food I have that I can adapt :-)"
"Thank you, I might try that. Interesting that it sounds similar. Does your gf cut out all wheat even in sauces ? Thanks"
thanks. i guess i might change my diet
"Yep. Absolutely everything. The only thing she's not paranoid about is if we go to a restaurant and they use the same equipment to prepare the normal and GF ingredients (obviously they clean it between preparations, but they don't use separate setups for each) . She finds that level of absolute isn't necessary for her to avoid feeling crummy."

Note that you really really need to cut it ALL out for at least 30 days to remove all traces from your digestive tract. Then you can see how you feel.
"Thank you, I’ll try that. Fingers crossed it helps 🤞"
What tests did you have done? What do you mean when you say high on the tests? Have you been able to get any prednisone or anything to calm your symptoms down?
"Have you seen a rheumatologist? Been tested for SSA/SSB? I think you may also want to see a ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist for your eye problems. Unfortunately, for a new patient it can be a lengthy wait to see a rheumatologist, but they can do appropriate testing and put it together for you. Hope you can get a diagnosis and treatment that helps your symptoms."
"Gotta say your symptoms really sound like Sjögren’s. My first horrible symptom was eyes so dry I had to start putting gel drops three times per hour.  Then a month later the dryness of mouth, joint pains, muscle pains, cognitive problems you name it. Ofcourse I had had some weird little symptoms for years but they hadn’t been debilitating like the symptoms I started to get at the beginning of the year 2012."

"Went to a rheumatologist, he laughed at me and told me I’m too young (20 at that time) and good looking that I could ever have anything like I was suspecting I have. He told me I was just hypochondriac and that people like me come to see him few times per month. I left the place crying and got so traumatized I didn’t visit any doctors in four years."

"My symptoms just got worse and worse. Eventually in the fall of 2016 my parents had the money to send me to see a private specialist on sjögren’s and he ordered me to have the lip biopsy, then I finally got my diagnosis."

I have tried different basic medications but they have usually done more bad than good. Now I just eat Triptyl to be able to sleep better.

"I have a very strict and specific diet with which I can manage my pains. The fatigue though, nothing seems to help with that."

Good luck to you! I hope you will find out what you have. :-)
I've recently been on a quest to get diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) myself for the last 7months after having chronic fatigue (and some other issues) since late last year. I don't really have answer to most of your concerns (especially those regarding genetics) but I hope maybe my experience can help you on your journey to diagnosis. I want to mention that I have no family history of Sjogren's.

"Dry eyes and dry mouth is a hallmark symptoms of Sjogren's Syndrome but they have less diagnostic value. The only way to get a 'definite' diagnosis of Sjogren's is to test positive in BOTH the blood test and the lip biopsy. As you mentioned, we do see many different doctors just to get one diagnosis, but remember, your rheumatologist is ultimately going to give your a Sjogren's diagnosis."

"I tested positive for SSA-antibodies, I have gone to a ophthalmologist to confirm my dry eyes and I've gone to a dentist to confirm my dry mouth. The otolaryngologist I've seen recently told me that this means I have basically 3 points (different countries may have different diagnostic point systems) and a positive lip biopsy would bring me to the 4 points needed for definite diagnosis. However, when I finally got to my otolaryngologist appointment (this was just last month btw) to get a lip biopsy I learnt that lip biopsies are not fool proof/gold standard test I thought it was. The otolaryngologist (he was a really great doctor) first asked me if I'm having a 'flare up' now or had one recently because if I haven't it is likely that the biopsy will come back negative/normal. He could see from his simple examination that if I had Sjogren's Syndrome I was a pretty mild case of it- which I did agree. I know how badly some people suffer with Sjogren's and recently I've been put on a medication called Hydroxychloroquine and I've been have been experiencing improvements with my dry eyes and mouth (\*I didn't want to go off topic but quickly; the improvements are also highly attributed to my recent removal/diagnosis/management of endometriosis. Both my rheumatologist and gynaecologist agree the inflammation of my endometriosis was what would of made my Sjogren's symptoms worse). Both the rheumatologist and otolaryngologist has reassured me at this point of my medical journey neither a positive or negative lip biopsy results would change how they would manage my symptoms. To be honest I would of done the lip biopsy if it was 5 or 6months prior, this was before I was on hydroxychloroquine and before I got my laproscopy done because it was that bad back then. I had months of painful burning sensation on my tongue, persistent month ulcers, severe fatigue (to the point I couldn't work) and just general weakness and pain in all my limbs. At this moment in time I've come to realise that the benefits of a lip biopsy outweigh the risks (main one being damage to adjacent structures from the biopsy sight that might require cutting out)."

Now I'm planning to continue on my hydroxychloroquine medication until I see my rheumatologist for the second time to monitor my progress. I also manage my dry eyes with eye drops and dry mouth with oral spray whenever its needed. So far I find learning how to adjust my lifestyle/life goals/expectations the hardest but I am slowly making progress :)

"I know that feeling of frustration when medical tests/examinations turns out ""normal"" but as I have found out, diagnosis of Sjogren's isn't a straight forward process. In regards to this I want to mention about 'Schirmer's Test', which I don't know if you'll come across. It's just a simple test to see how much tears you produce. I did do the test because the rheumatologist told me it's one diagnostic test for Sjogren's but when I got it done it came out ""normal"". I did some research before doing the test and I went in knowing that 'Schirmer's Test' was very inaccurate in diagnosing dry eyes and later when I got an appointment with an ophthalmologist I asked him how accurate the test is and he told me ""well let's put it this way. I haven't done a Schirmer's Test for over 6 years."" I was very mad for some time after thinking how stupid it was for my rheumatologist to suggest to anyone to do this stupid test."

"I went into my first rheumatologist appointment thinking I'm finally going to get a definitive answer; either ""yes, you do have Sjogren's"" or ""no, you don't have Sjogren's"" and now six month later I'm in the grey zone of uncertainty (probably with many other people like me). I've been lucky I've most of my encounters with medical professionals have been great but sometimes when I do tell them how exhausted I am and only answer is to persevere with healthy lifestyle & diet with medication I wish I could just somehow transfer my all my pains and aches into their bodies and tell them to try to persevere (not that I'd wish this kind of suffering on anybody but just out of sheer frustration built up)."

So I don't know if any of this long rant was of any value to you but regardless I wish you well on your endeavours. Cheers :)

&#x200B;
"I haven't seen one.  I have not had either a blood test or a lip biopsy yet, but this is still early.  I believe she is asking me to see a dentist first in hopes they can determine a source for my oral manifestations, but I can only imagine an opthamologist and rheumatologist are both in future if further testing suggests this is Sjogren's. Thank you very much."

"Edit: also, just to clarify, I don't think my optometrist is going to be my definitive doctor in handling this disorder.   She's just the first line of defense, and the first doctor I've talked about this with.  Because of my history I'm pretty cagey about involving any more specialists until there's a clear reason to do so.  I hope that makes sense."
"Wow, the doctor's response to you is insane.  Selena Gomez has lupus, Jamie Lynn Sigler has MS, Zoe Saldana has Hashimoto's and Venus Williams has Sjogren's.  They're all young and attractive and it didn't stop them from developing a disease."

"Interestingly I was on amitriptyline for a pretty significant amount of time and it helped ""quiet"" my IBS symptoms, which is what I was taking it for.  My allergist compelled me to get off of it but I still don't really know why.  Makes you wonder, right?"

"Thank you very much!  I'll hope medicine continues to make strides in autoimmunity for you and others, even if it turns out that's not what's going on with me."
Have you had the lip biopsy done?
"It helps if nothing else to know that I'm not alone in this, but I do appreciate hearing others' stories as well!  I also appreciate your input that the best time to get tested is during a flare.  That is kind of what I figured."

"I'll be honest, I'm not attached to the label of Sjogren's.  I see quite a few others starting off their journey thinking they have a particular rheumatic issue and are finally diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disorder... that wouldn't phase me.  I just don't want to be told anymore that they don't know, I just have to power through this and that there is nothing that will help me.  Another fear I have is being stricken down with some kind of acute response, having to be hospitalized, and them not knowing any idea what's going on.  For example I have an asthma diagnosis, but what if my asthma is actually the beginnings of interstitial lung disease?  What if I'm missing out on any kind of preventative treatment that could lessen the impact of ILD as I age?  What if the corticosteroids I'm on actually \*worsen\* any pulmonary manifestation of this disease (I'm not saying they do, just giving an example)?"

"Also, I want my kids to know their medical history.  My husband unfortunately has cancer running pretty strongly in his background.  His onco is pushing for genetic testing to make sure he hasn't passed anything down to our kids, which I am completely fine with, but I've brought my own genetic baggage to our relationship and I believe knowledge is power."

Thank you again!
Ahaha just re-read my post and realised I didn't specify weather I had it or not.

"No, I didn't end up having the biopsy done. If I did it would of been simple as getting it done in the Otolaryngologist's consultation rooms. I still have the options to get it done in the future but at the moment the risks of the lip biopsy outweigh the benefits."
I haven't gained any weight on it and have been taking it a few years. Didn't know it was a side effect.
"I’ve been taking it for just a month and haven’t gained weight, but my appetite has increased since it’s not such a chore to chew! I could see that resulting in weight gain for some people"
"While I'm no doctor, this seems way too soon to consider Sjögren's Syndrome as the cause. Additionally, I have never heard of a case that presented like this... immediately after a cold. I don't think that six weeks is long enough for the damage that needs to be done for you to experience SS symptoms. The infiltration of your moisture-producing glands with cells that destroy its function takes considerably longer. I would definitely widen your scope."

"If by chance you've had increased urination, get your blood sugar checked. I only mention this because untreated diabetes can cause extreme dryness, but it would be accompanied by thirst. Sjögren's dryness is not."

Good luck!
Have you read about r/dysautonomia? It is often triggered by viruses. That is how mine started. Temperature regulation issues are common with dysautonomia
Sjogren's should be confirned by lip biopsy
My blood sugar has been checked. No diabetes. I don't have increased urination. Not dehydrated either and electrolytes good based on tests.

My urge to have a bowel movement is non-stop. I would either have solid if I hold it in (I could hold all day but uncomfortable) or diarrhea if I don't. It's like my body passes stools too fast and I need to hold in to let it form.

I haven't been to their reddit.

I suspect it's autoimmune and maybe autonomic disorder as well. I read that both can be related and cause the other.

I've talked to my neurologist at tufts and he simply doesn't know (says not enough evidence yet but doesn't run autonomic tests). Same for my Rheumotologist.

Can you elaborate on your specific symptoms?

If anybody has input on Sjogren or autoimmune please let me know as well.

"I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this. Both the frustration with my doctors and my symptoms have made this the hardest 2 months in my life. I'm 32, and while I'm trying to remain optimistic but I'm in a lot of physical discomfort/pain."
I don't have energy to elaborate on my symptoms but there is a lot of information on [http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/](http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/)Perhaps read there and see if symptoms match up and then pursue autonomic testing?
I'll check that out.

My ANA is apparently 1 160 but rhuemotologist was dismissive. Didn't do much for me at all.

Wasn't aware of early sjogren panel either.

No compassion. And refused to do other tests while I have a constellation of symptoms.
I get them whenever i eat spicy foods. Peroxyl heals them up pretty quickly.
"I'd go to your dentist, they can then refer you if it's needed."
"I have the same problem.  I get very dry mouth.  Was sick with Pharyngitis and Thrush a few months back.  As I was getting better,"
"my tongue started hurting, and got small sores on the front of my tongue.  They hurt like hell!  I don't think there is much you can do about them, other than let them run their course.  When I was sick, my ENT gave me ""magic mouthwash"" ( maalox, lidocane, and other stuff) to rinse with.  Numbs your mouth for a bit.  I am also using Orajel rinse  (hydrogen peroxide).  Burns a bit, but you can see it bubble up on your sores.  Good luck!"
"Is this unrelated to any sort of contact with your teeth, etc? I ask because I deal with something that sounds the same almost constantly, but it's just contact with my teeth. It took me awhile to figure this out because the location can change. The least unexpected sort of abrasion can become a new sore. For me, one factor seems to be the ph of my mouth. Occasionally, it's significantly altered and I'm way more prone to tongue injury then."
That happens to me right before I have a flare.
I had this happen when I went off cevimeline for a while.
It seems to be brought on by mouth dryness for me.
Like both sides of my tongue are getting burned.
The only way to fix it for me is to deal with the mouth dryness (I went back on the medication.)
"Seronegative Sjogren's Syndrome (SS with negative blood work) is quite common; estimates range from 25-35&#37;+ of patients. My personal anecdotal experience is that seronegativity is more common in young people and in men, so you are a prime candidate. Your symptoms seem very much in line with seronegative SS."

"Unfortunately, many doctors have become overly reliant on blood work, and are not well informed about seronegative SS. They also tend to be biased against men and young people having SS. At this point, you have two clear options:"

* Find a rheumatologist who will listen to you and diagnose and treat based on your symptoms.
* Get a minor salivary gland (lip) biopsy and hope for a positive result.

"As a young man with seronegative SS, I know the experience of moving from specialist to specialist trying to get a diagnosis even though my symptoms fit SS perfectly. My first rheumatologist recommended a psychologist when my blood work came back negative, and told me young men don't get SS. Luckily, I eventually found a rheumatologist who was willing to take my concerns seriously."

"I would caution you regarding a MSG biopsy; there are a lot of nerves in that area and permanent damage is not uncommon. Both my current and previous rheumatologist have stopped recommending them due to those issues, and both were willing to treat me based on my symptoms. Unfortunately, these types of doctors appear to be the exception rather than the norm, and you may not find someone as open-minded in your area. If you do decide to get a biopsy, find an oral surgeon who has a lot of experience in this particular biopsy."

"Treatment options for SS are currently limited. They are mostly limited to symptomatic treatments for oral and ocular dryness (Restasis, Xiidra, Evoxac, Salagen, etc.). You can also try hydroxychloroquine (generic Plaquenil) which some patients find helpful for fatigue and aches. Lifestyle changes such as anti-inflammatory diets, moderate exercise, extra sleep, and stress-reduction can also help. Some patients (including myself) have found alternative therapies and supplements to be helpful, and most don't require a prescription. Just be careful, as there is a lot of snake oil out there. One a positive note, there are a number of potential systemic treatments in the clinical trial pipeline, including a phase 3 trial for a biologic drug scheduled to complete by next summer."

I have a [small blog](http://www.whatyousjo.com/) I maintain about my own journey and treatment. I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.
"There are a few cheap and easy tests that you can request to assess your eyes and mouth. Ask for the Schirmer's eye test and a saliva flow and spit volume test. Both are cheap, easy, and can be done during a normal appointment. If either of those two tests show extreme dryness, it'll warrant further examination."

"Edit: I just wanted to add that I'll gladly answer any questions that you may have about Sjögren's Syndrome, things to consider, how to be taken seriously, etc. I like to recommend these in-office tests because they are cheap, simple and for those reasons, a doctor shouldn't deny you the opportunity to do them. As well, they are an unbiased and conclusive way to assess the dryness of your eyes and mouth."

Something else to ask yourself..  Is your mouth dry or do you feel thirst? They aren't the same thing. Sjögren's Syndrome doesn't cause thirst.

"Also, best of luck in figuring out what is going on and, hopefully, resolving the situation."
"Amazing response mate, thank you. Living in the UK so finding a rheumy depends on my doctor referring me there so I'll push them for that, though the one my doctor emailed about my situation seemed to think my blood tests mean I don't have SS so it's gonna be a challenge but I'll keep pushing!"

"How is your experience with treatments regarding oral dryness? The fatigue is hard but I soldier on & manage to work full time & also work out 4 times per week, but the dryness is the thing that's affecting my life the most, I wake up every morning feeling like I've been out drinking heavily the night before gasping for water (I rarely drink at all). Also, what are your non prescription supplements that have helped?"

"Thanks again for the in depth answer, will get reading that blog of yours when I have some free time!"
"They had to do a lip biopsy to diagnose me, FYI - everything else was normal."
"I actually have more issues with my eyes than my mouth, though Restasis has helped a bit there. As a result, I'm not currently on Salagen or Evoxac, though other patients I've spoken to have found them helpful. My disease has mostly affected my parotid glands, so I tend to get dry throat rather than dry mouth. In your case, I would push for a prescription for generic Salagen or Evoxac."

"That said, my anti-inflammatory diet (based on the Autoimmune Protocol elimination diet; no wheat, dairy, processed sugar, etc.) along with rest and stress-reduction has helped a bit, as well as some of the alternative therapies that I've outlined on my blog's [treatment page](http://www.whatyousjo.com/treatments/my-treatment-regimen/) such as helminths, supplements, and low-dose Naltrexone."
"Ahh right my problem is more mouth than eyes. Looked into AIP alot already looking to start that when I get a proper diagnosis, it looks tough! Has that helped you much?"
"Hey, WingsAndDat, just a quick heads-up:"
"**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**."
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
It has. There are certain foods like wheat and processed sugar that definitely make my symptoms worse.
"No LASIK, but mine was discovered because I had hemorrhaging in my eye, and they did a ton of tests to try to determine the cause. They never figured it out, and it went away after a couple days, but I was thankfully finally diagnosed with SS."

"I really think mine was triggered by anthrax immunizations that I had to get in the military. My rheumatologist agrees, but there's likely no way I could prove it. 😑"
[deleted]
No Lasik here.
"Yes, 6 years prior to my diagnosis. I didn't notice any increased dryness afterward."
I haven't had LASIK or eye injury.
"Not sure if it added to the dryness, but my docs say the scar of the flap is adding to my visual distortion in addition to the dryness. I also have astigmatism and Adies tonic pupil to distort further as well."
I haven't had LASIK.
I had the same thing! About a year before I was diagnosed I was on the subway heading to work and my left eye hemorrhaged for no reason. My eye doctor kept saying that there had to be a reason it happened but they never found anything. I wonder if it was Sjogrens related? I assumed it was just a freak thing that happened.
Interesting! Thanks for responding; I guess we all have our theories.
"Yes, I had plugs after my LASIK procedure 6 years ago to help with that (it did help, along with Restasis). I wasn’t diagnosed with Sjogren’s until about 4 years later. However, I’m wondering if the procedure itself could have somehow contributed to Sjogren’s. The exposure of the inner eye being foreign and possibly eliciting an autoimmune response? Really I just want a tally. I know three other people who had LASIK prior to their diagnosis and it’s got me thinking."
Anytime I get sick I take forever to heal.
You should get the flu shot every year.

"Actually, your immune system is amazing... Too amazing. Having an autoimmune disease means your body is really good at protecting itself and goes so far as to attack you because it thinks you are dangerous. So, when you do get sick, it will tend to be the really bad bugs that getcha."
"When others get a cold, it turns into bronchitis for me, and then I have to get checked for pneumonia. I seem to stay sick longer and it hits harder"
"When I began showing my first symptoms 25 years ago, I stopped coming down with contagious diseases. I do get a flu shot these days, but I no longer get sick."
I was diagnosed in 2016 and every year is becoming different but I don’t feel the same pain as when I was untreated
Interesting answer. I wasn’t considering that point. As I said above I was diagnosed in 2016 and every year is  becoming different but I don’t feel the same pain as when I was untreated. Most of the time I was tired and my right hand was suffering from arthritis pain. Nowadays the pain that I feel comes from my knees
Does it happen to you frequently? When I catch a flu my bones from my left hand hurt
"I have pain in my hands daily, and it's not RA. Currently being checked for Lymphoma  :("
"If the headaches are truly debilitating I'm afraid you need a doctor's opinion. It could be anything =/  Meanwhile: drink water, get his eye sight checked maybe...?"
"Have him see a doctor, who may send him to a neurologist.  I see one,  I get headaches and migraines,  I have brain lesions."
"This is going to be a shit answer, but it depends. You may get much, much worse. You may stay exactly as you are now. You may react excellently to medication. Heck, you could even go into remission. Or not have Sjögrens at all. I'm really sorry but there's nothing to do now but wait until Tuesday. Good luck."
"Slightly more practical advice: look up the difference between seronegative and seropositive sjögrens, and make sure to ask your doctor which variant you have (if any). The prognosis is different."
Okay thank you.
"Thank you, will do."
"Yeah, that is tough.  I don't know of a practical solution.   Maybe something inflatable?"
[Would this help?](https://medicalproductssupply.com/inflatable-bed-wedge-w-cover.html)

I know there are adapters you can buy for blow dryers that could be used to inflate it.
"I use liquid antacid and stash a couple of bottles around to take to work or keep by my bed. One big swig right before I go to sleep is enough to last all night, but just in case I make sure not to eat anything sugary or acidy an hour or two before. Obviously we aren't able to use Tums, but I've found the liquid antacid is more affordable and works quicker."
Curious- why no Tums?
"No spit + dry, chalky tums = choke city."
"Once you unglue your tongue from the roof of your mouth, it's pretty gnarly scraping tums off your teeth. Liquid antacid is the way to go."
Oh ok. If I take my Evoxac I haven’t had an issue but good to keep in mind.
I have this lingering cough/ clear my throat thing for a few years now. Finally saw an ENT and he said its acid reflux. I place a wedge pillow under me now and its gotten better and I get a little more sleep at night and my throat thing has gotten better.

"As far as eyesight I was told I needed glasses for years and kept changing my prescription. Turns out behind my eye lid was so inflammed that it caused little scratches on the eye and blurry vision, I dont need glasses at all. They also said I eye drops lots of them all day. I also got antibiotic drops and it helped with inflammation."

It may not be the same as your wifes issues but I hope it helps a little. It took years to figure all of this out. Doctor adter doctor told me it was different things and I learned what worked for me and what didnt. We have to be our own doctors at times.
"I’ve been diagnosed since I was 18, I’m 29 now, this is one of the more obnoxious issues I have, I have about a million eye drops and try to use heat compresses on my eyes when they get so blurred out that my glasses aren’t sitting right with my vision. The dry cough is just annoying. I use a lot of lozenges but it just never goes away and I have to take a drink if I’m on a call or in a meeting almost every 3-5 words. It’s very annoying, but no prescription drops have helped thus far. I wish I had better advise!"
"Thanks for your reply. Yes, reflux is definitely part of the cough issue. My wife has been treated for E Pylori bacteria and the usual remedies for reflux. She has also taken to sleeping while seated in a recliner for the past year, which has helped - at least through the night. As for her eyes, she has seen an Opthamologist familiar with SS regularly without any resolution. I appreciate you sharing your info."
No problem. I hope someone comes along who could help more. :)
Did your GYN run an ANA blood test?
[deleted]
"For the dry skin, in addition to what everyone has said here already, maybe get a humidifier for whatever room your in most often, or get multiple humidifiers. I have one in my bedroom and it has helped. I take Benadryl a lot for my dry skin when I go to bed. I have the red face off and on, too, but I don't wear make-up so I think it gives me a little bit of color! And I get severe cramping and pain in my calves but I have attributed that to the Sjogren's and the fact that I'm an RN and walk a lot. Maybe it's just the Sjogren's after all. I use heat and compression socks to help with that. I have nausea a lot but I'm just used to that now and take an OTC med called Nauzene and sip club soda if it gets too bad. I hope you find some relief with the suggestions everyone has given you - I'm sorry you're going through this :("
I don't believe so.
"Thank you for the response! I didn't mean that I was excessively exfoliating, just that when I do it is so much skin! I also don't use physical exfoliates on my face, only chemical ones such as BHA and AHA. I'm actually pretty big into skincare and already use oil cleansers, cream cleansers, serums, oils, creams, masks, etc. It has been just super dry, especially my body skin, which I also have a BHA and AHA for. I am also in the US and the GP I'm seeing is based on a sliding a scale, however, I have only recently just had my first visit, so I'm unsure how things will unfold. However, I still pan on looking into some form of aid."
"I know how frustrating it is to feel not well but not have any answers. I was lucky enough to have a GP who was smart enough to run an ANA test. This is a basic autoimmune antibody test that, if positive, can help get you a referral to a rheumatologist who can follow up more. I would start with asking for an ANA blood test and wait for those results. If it comes back negative, I’d try it again every 3-6 months."
"Thank you! When I go back to my GP, I plan on asking for several specific tests that people on several of the autoimmune disorder forums have informed me about. I'm not positive what exactly is going on, but I am almost certain it is autoimmune related, particularly Hashimoto's, Sjogren's, or perhaps Lupus."
"For Hashimoto’s, they can test your TSH, which is just basic thyroid function, and run a specific antibody test just for the thyroid. I don’t remember the name of this test as I had it done over 10 years ago. However, ANA is for lupus, sjogrens, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma (maybe a few others attached to this test, too). There are more antibody tests that help pinpoint these diseases more specifically (like one means 90% lupus, etc.) but I didn’t have this run until I had ANA come back positive."

Some other more general tests you might have been told about already are ESR and CRP. These show damage/inflammation but aren’t specific to anything.

A urinalysis can check for protein.

Good luck with everything. I hope you are able to put some names to your mystery!
"Also I have all three that you mentioned - Hashimoto’s, sjorgrens, and lupus. Do you find you have a dry mouth and/or dry eyes?"
"Thank you so much..I truly appreciate all the help and feedback! This is what I needed help with, I didn't have a clue as to what specific tests I should ask about till recently, and this info most definitely has helped."
"I do have dry mouth, have for years. My eyes, it just depends. Some days they can be dry, but not excessively."
The reason I ask is because it was hard for me to realize that I actually had super dry eyes and mouth because it slowly happened over so many years that I got used to it. I even remember reading about Sjogrens for the first time and thinking that I didn’t have it.
"Oh, I understand. All my symptoms have been progressing for about the past 8 years now. It's just I'm now to a point where something has to be done, I'm simply not functioning at this point. My eyes probably are more dry than most, but my mouth is more so dry."
"If you’re blind in one eye, you need to go to the ER! That could be a lot of really bad stuff like a torn retina so go NOW! Good luck!"
Are you on plaquenil?  My rhuematologist mentioned a rare side effect of it that can cause blindness.
Hi I actually went to an eye doctor my retina is fine. The cause is optic neuritis which the doctor said is caused by a sjogrens flare
"Nope no plaquenil yet, doctors are sending me to a specialist soon to figure out why my optic nerve is swelling."
"Not sure about the asthma part, but the rest of it sounds like Sjogrens symptoms. If the symptoms have significantly increased in nature and/or intensity without apparent cause, I would consider that a flare."

There's a discussion about Sjogren's and asthma on the first page of Sjogrens World forum right now. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?topic=31000.0

I hope you're able to see a rheumatologist and get treatment soon.
"I'm having a flare up too, is my first since diagnoses and I'm not sure what I did to set it off :("
"Thanks, I’ll have a look at that."
I have never heard of low gamma globulin being a test in the context of Sjogren's. Is this something you would recommend everyone with Sjogren's be tested for?

"About plaquenil: I found it reduced autoimmunity-induced fatigue, but it certainly didn't cure it. The side effects tend to be pretty mild, but you do need to monitor your retinas on at least a yearly basis, as plaquenil can cause retinal thinning."
"I'd also like to add that if you don't like your rheumatologist, it should be possible to get one that you actually like - even with bad insurance. My insurance isn't great either, but I decided to drive to a major US city to see mine, and I find the treatment is much better. Maybe if you find a rheumatologist in a major city or at a teaching hospital you will have better luck."
"I'm not sure why my doctor ordered the gamma globulin test -- or the Sjogren's, either. Probably because of the symptoms I'm struggling with."

"Thanks on the Plaquenil. I decided to go ahead and pull my allergist/immunologist into the mix and give her all the test results. We'll see what she has to say. Navigating doctors and making sure none of them drop the ball is not the easiest thing to do. Based off what she recommends, I'll search again for a new rheumatologist once my new 2018 insurance kicks in (I have to change most of my doctors thanks to how the insurance works around here, ugh)."
My ophthalmologist prescribes a mild steroid eye drop called Lotemax very judiciously (small bottle only lasting a short amount of time for crisis) because it can cause eye damage. She said it can be used daily if patient is monitored regularly for the damage. I forget what kind of damage.

"Have you tried Restasis drops, Xildra drops or punctal plugs yet?"

You might want to try using eye gel drops or eye gel before going to sleep. My eyes are definitely worse with lack of sleep.
I use Restasis and Zaditen for my eye inflammation. My eyes would get *catastrophically* worse after a bad night's sleep.  This has mellowed out quite a bit since I had punctum plugs installed.
"I use restasis, it’s helped a lot actually with the everday pain, but it’s sort of plateaued now and it doesn’t stop those inflammatory episodes.  I also use hylo gel drops and a thicker gel at night."

"Btw the damage it can cause is that continuous steroid use can raise your intraocular pressure which can lead to glaucoma and they can also cause cataracts. Dexamethasone is pretty notorious for it so even though it’s very effective it’s only used for very short amounts of time. Usually the pressure decreases when you stop using the steroids but I think once you go over a certain threshold glaucoma becomes a real concern. Lotemax is actually a favourite for things like this, because it’s a sort of best of both worlds steroid. It’s less strong than Fluorometholone (which is an older steroid) but it’s got much better penetration and is really low risk in terms of eye pressure. It’s just that some people are really sensitive to increases in pressure so you still have to be careful with it. But because it’s on the safer end of the spectrum some people can use it for longer periods of time."
"(Also, I've used FML steroids in the past and I've found that my eye pressure actually went down in that period. To the point where they felt uncomfortable. Anyone else have this?"
Here's a list of lab tests and non-lab tests with descriptions of each. https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/sjogren/start/2
"Get the ""Early SS"" blood test done.  Only a couple of labs do this test."
Thanks
I had two rounds of Accutane around 10-11 years ago. I'm not diagnosed with Sjogren's but I experience several of the symptoms including dryness.
Nope sorry.
"Diagnosed SJS and no, never took accutane."
"Yep, I took Accutane 10 years ago."
My boyfriend has sever dry mouth from accutane but doesn't have sjogrens.
"No, not me."
This
Yes. The biopsy doesn't check the dryness of your mouth.
Have you had a blood test? Positive SSA and/or SSB indicates Sjogren's and that could negate the need for lip biopsy.
it was negative...years ago
my ana is negative and my rf
but i read that ssa/ssb has like a 30 percent false negative rate

Some people swear by the 'auto-immune protocol' diet. There's a subreddit for it if you want to check it out.
"Will definitely look into it, thank you. The list of possible side effects there are pretty daunting for me, too, so I'll definitely talk it over with the doc."
"Thank you, I'm looking into this right now. My diet is somewhat healthy right now (compared to last year), but I really should keep a food journal. One thing is for sure: In the last couple of years, I have noticed much more severe responses to certain food than in the last decade. Has the AIP diet worked for you?"
[deleted]
"Instead of following the AIP diet, I had bloodtests done for IGg and eliminated foods based one their scores. A year later I was able to reintroduce everything except lactose (gave me terrible muscle cramps). It's helped my muscle/joint pain, but not my eyes and mouth. I'm still considering going for the full AIP diet someday."
Thanks for the info. It'll make me feel a bit more confident moving forward. Did you feel a bit bad getting used to it in the beginning?
[deleted]
"Yes quite often skin crawls too. Comes in waves, but happens quite often."

"It could be, the crawling I believe is a symptom... some people believe the spider web feeling is ""supernatural"" that its residual energy from a *looks both ways*"

A ghost. O.O
"Hmm... when I typed my symptoms into google (I know, I know) MS and Fibromyalgia came up."
I think i'm haunted by the ghost of neuropathy.
"Neurologist handles MS, rheumatologist handles fibromyalgia... please see a physician!"
Yeah me too. >.<*
The hard contacts were way too painful.  The soft contacts tended to crawl up into a ball and come out of my eyes.  I lost several lenses that way.
It's been 9 hours and you don't seem to have a response so I'll share my experience with contacts.

"Wearing them wasn't really an issue, sometimes you blink and your eye hurts so you put a few lubricated eye drops in and move on, the annoying/difficult part was removing them at the end of the night because your eyes get dry and they don't seem to want to come off."

"Some days they would come off with a little work and hardly a fuss, other days were straight 8-15 min struggles as it felt the contact had fused with my eyeball. If you get contacts you can expect days like these but they might not be as numerous as mine."
"If you really want contacts, get the daily disposable lenses. The other types will irritate your eyes more. It really depends on the level of dryness you experience though."
"I wore daily disposable contacts for 18 months and eventually had to stop. My eyes would get so dry, even with rewetting drops, the contacts would pop out. I also found out all the pink eyes  I was getting was actually to posterior blepharitis; which is actually pretty common with SS."
"Thank you so much for your insight,  I greatly appreciate it!"
thank you! Very useful
"My SS came on at 18 after a severe strep infection, but it took 10 years to diagnose since men aren’t “supposed” to get it, especially young ones.  I have had a plethora of neurological problems due to my Sjogrens over the years. I had a sudden sense of nausea that last for six months straight once.  24/7.  I never threw up, but wanted to.  I lost so much weight I had to force myself to eat.  They called it neuropathic nausea probably caused by SS affecting the vagus nerve.  One day it just went away.  I’ve been on gabapentin for years, which they said should have helped the nausea but didn’t.  Typical anti nausea drugs won’t work on something with a neurological origin.  Next year I had sudden burning mouth syndrome for six months.  That was unpleasant.  Now I’m battling unilateral vocal fold paralysis where I’ll suddenly lose a lot of my voice for no apparent reason.   I hope your symptoms clear up soon, I know how frustrating it can be."
"I had ligament pains in my hands, and I Told my pcp about it and they did a blood sample and I had high levels of SS. so they referred me to a rheumatoid arthritis specialist who can diagnosis it. I couldnt get a appointment for 2 months, then the rheumatoid arthritis place did another blood sample to see if I have any other autoimmune diseases. I just had SS and they officially diagnosed me on Aug 11th of this year and been on plaquenil, I hope it doesnt get worse. hopefully you caught it soon enough that you don't run into other major things. I mostly run out of energy (10hr work days) and my muscles/joints hurt (mainly my hands) Good luck! btw I'm 34 male"
"I had noticed that there are few accounts of young males having SS. It's still unconfirmed for me obviously, will hear back in a couple of weeks to know for certain. Glad to hear my symptoms aren't entirely unusual. Thanks for the good wishes too, same to you as well :)"
"Sorry to hear that man, I hope your symptoms pass soon! I too have had the muscle ache (especially in my neck and back) and I know how much of a bitch that can be to handle."
"I'm in my 50s now and have been told that had I been diagnosed sooner that maybe my condition wouldn't be as bad now, so if you do get diagnosed I hope it will help you.  I was 20 when I noticed the dry eyes and that I couldn't wear contacts anymore.  Had a few eye infections, swollen glands, etc.  Everyone kept rationalizing it was something else.  No one thought to check a 20 y/o man for SS.  This was back before the internet, so that didn't help me.  Ten years later  I found the answer in a dry eye pamphlet in the eye doc's waiting area.  I had an eye infection again.  Last sentence in it said it may be from a disease called Sjogren's.  I asked about it and two weeks later I had my answer.  SS-A and SS-B antibodies were off the chart."
"Thank you, I hate when I get pains in my neck, I can barely turn around while i'm driving. it's getting better but I hope in time you don't have to as much in the future. NSAID are helpful when I'm having a real had time.  Have you tried them before?"
"Interesting! I stopped wearing contacts recently for the same reason. I haven't had any infection or anything like that but they've become uncomfortable to wear (and I've had them for around 4 years with no issue). Overall, I've only had my symptoms for between 1-2 years so hopefully it's still early stages."
"I've previously been diagnosed with IBS, which I believe to have actually been the chronic appendicitis. Though a lot of the symptoms that have now fully manifested themselves were put down to that diagnoses."
"Not as of yet, but I'll keep those in mind! Interestingly, the aches are something I can learn to live with if I really set my mind to it. It's hard, but I've done it. It's more the nausea that worries me the most, I'm hoping that's not long term!"
"I have some nausea in my stomach, someone suggested drink some milk and that should help it."
"Did you try splitting the dose to one in the morning and one in the evening with not ""a big meal"" each time? Alternatively, you can try ramping up. Just take one a day for a while and when your comfortable with that up it to two. In addition, taking it with milk may mitigate the nausea."
You can split the dose as another poster says. You also can grind the pill and sprinkle it onto food.

"If you really have trouble tolerating it the brand name tends to not cause the stomach issues, but is much more expensive."
"I got headaches from the generic brand, but no side effects when I take the name brand. Maybe something to look into?"
"the first two weeks I tried to spilt the dosage but I still need to have big meals with them, figured if I just had 1 big meal I can take both. I just want to avoid the diarrhea that comes with it."
"hmm that's good to know about the brand name one. and a great idea about grinding them. might have to try that out, Thank you!"
I'm going to see the dr next month. I'll talk to him about it. I haven't gotten any headaches.
"Never heard about this before. I did some googling and apparently there's a correlation between autoimmunity and schizofrenia, but not so much with bipolarity. (one of the papers: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950824/)"
"No but I’m associated with a large group of people that have anxiety, feel overly responsible, and are perfectionistic. They seem to have a higher rate of auto immune then other groups of the same size I’ve know."
"Thanks! I saw a few papers for OCD from a friend, but not much on bipolarity either."
"Welcome. What makes you believe they are related, if I may ask?"
"Ever since my autoimmune conditions have gotten worse, I've had new and worsening psychiatric symptoms. I've seen some studies linking Sjögren's to OCD and schizo-symptoms, so I'm looking to research that further."
"I think a couple of people on Sjogren's World are on it . You might want to check there, also. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=ae219a27c76c35bf21616c0ea01cf51f&board=1.0"
"I agree with this post completely. I got my Sjogren's after an acute bout of food poisoning. I also ended up getting ankylosing spondylitis, but I was able to cure that with a low starch diet (read: Dr. Alan Ebringer and the AS Institute)."

"I don't know why the AS totally responded to the diet but Sjogren's did not, but that is exactly what happened. That said, if you eat the wrong things, your eye dryness will get a hell of a lot worse."
Start eating more Fiber rich foods and a mediterranean diet.
Wow!! Thanks for replying where was the Ankylosing spondilosis? I'll check out that doctor
What wrong things? 0_o
"Gotta be careful what type of fiber you're consuming. If it's not autoimmune Paleo friendly, you may run into issues. For many people with Sjogrens, autoimmune Paleo is a safer diet than the Mediterranean."

"That said, for those that can tolerate it, the Mediterranean diet is great."
"The ankylosing spondylitis doctor is Dr. Alan Ebringer, but he has subsequently retired. You can find his research papers on Google Scholar. Let me know if you find anything you want to read but are stuck behind a paywall."
"Gluten, nightshades, sugar, eggs, nuts, dairy, soy."
"Can I ask how much this helped you? I followed an elimination diet for nine months (based on blood tests, supervised by a doctor) and it had absolutely no effect on my eyes. I've found a moderate correlation between lactose and joint pain, but that was pretty much it =/  Would love to hear if you have any suggestions."
"Well like I was saying, it completely resolved my ankylosing spondylitis. Yes, avoiding these foods doesn't make my eyes moist again, but it does prevent my eyes from getting worse."

"For example, I know that if I drink soda, my eyes will get much more inflamed than normal. Was your elimination diet following the autoimmune protocol (AIP)? I am a huge proponent of this diet because when I don't follow it, invariably bad things happen."

"In terms of suggestions, the things that help me are Restasis, cevimeline, Theralife autoimmune supplement, fish oil, resveratrol, CoQ10, sauna/steam room, moderate exercise (biking/swimming for the joints), and getting plenty of sleep. I've tried a lot of other things, but these are the only things that I definitely feel a difference from."
"Hi,"

"My wife has experienced this surgery.  Her goal was to receive a comprehensive sjogren's diagnosis.  She had the surgery performed in addition to blood work, an ultrasound, x rays and a tear (eye) test."

"The lip test biopsy was painful and very invasive.  The shots to receive the biopsy were painful, and having her lip pulled down during the process was uncomfortable.  There were several days of recovery, and her lip was very swollen, with 6 stitches, making eating and drinking difficult."

The results of the surgery were inconclusive. The other procedures she had confirmed her sjogren's.

Please let your mom know that it should not be something she takes lightly.

Thank you for advocating for your mother!

"I have primary Sjogren's and I will try to answer your questions as best I can. However, I'm not a medical professional and this isn't medical advice."

"A lip biopsy is a simple procedure and is fairly standard. Not everyone has it done, but the doctor who wanted me to have it done described it as a quick and simple procedure. I didn't have it done though because another doctor of mine had concerns because of another disease I have."

There is no one test that will definitively say that someone has Sjogren's so there are several that a doctor will choose from that best suits a particular patient's needs as will as the diagnostic criteria that helps make an accurate diagnosis.

"The blood test and the lip biopsy are just two of them. The diagnostic criteria for Sjogren's varies somewhat from one country to another, but in order for a proper diagnosis, the patient will usually need to have a positive blood test for antibodies and at least one of most of the following: eye symptoms, mouth symptoms, eye signs, mouth signs, and the lip biopsy. The difference between symptoms and signs is that signs are the actual tests used to measure saliva or tear production and symptoms are what the patient feels and how long they have been having issues. [Here is a link[(https://www.hopkinssjogrens.org/disease-information/diagnosis-sjogrens-syndrome/americaneuropean-consensus-criteria-sjgrens-syndrome/) to the actual diagnostic criteria in the U.S."

"For the lip biopsy, she will probably be given a local anesthetic to numb the area that they are going to remove the sample from on the inside of the lip (IIRC it's the lower lip). A small 1/2 inch shallow incision is made and a few glands are removed with tweezers. Then they suture the area closed."

"There may be some soreness for a few days after the procedure.  With any kind of procedure there may be a risk of infection or maybe even some other risks, but the doctor doing the procedure will go over those risks before the procedure. After the procedure, they should explain things to do, things to avoid, and things to watch out for."

"Since you have questions on whether the test is actually necessary, I would suggest you call both of the doctors and ask them specifically why they decided on the tests that they did. I have found out that over the years just asking why they came to their decision is often one of the best questions I can ask. Also, mention your mother's concerns and fears. Sometimes doctors forget how scary procedures can be to patients."


"Supposedly the biopsy isn't even necessary. My labs came back positive but my biopsy was negative, so they have no idea what it all means. For me, the procedure itself didn't hurt, but was just nervewracking because I'm a sissy and they had me hold my own lip down the whole time. Watching a scalpel come at your face is definitely weird. I popped a Xanax, had a friend drive me/be there for support and I made a playlist to listen to during the procedure. I didn't have any stitches since they cauterized it to close it up. I felt fine afterward, but after a few hours when the numbing shot wore off, I was uncomfortable. I was swollen up on the bottom lip for about a week and had a hard time eating and drinking--definitely couldn't use a straw--and kind of had to just dump drinks into my mouth and eat small bites of soft stuff. My lip looked disgusting while it was healing because of the cauterization scab, but I could only see it if I folded my lip down. I had a section of numbness in my lip for about 6 months, which freaked me out for a while, but eventually all the sensation came back. Sometimes when I drink something cold, I can feel the numbness for a second, so that's been the only lingering ""issue."""
"I'd think that there's not enough behind the idea of the lip biopsy to support it being ""necessary"" or even *helpful* when diagnosing most people. I'd also be wary about jumping straight into chemo. My doctor pushed it like crazy and I turned it down, which potentially would have done *nothing* because my primary is currently in the process of verifying that I don't actually have sjogrens (at least not primarily) and that my main issue is actually autoimmune hypothyroidism. I'd do a lot more medical sleuthing before committing to either the biopsy *or* the chemo."
What were your mom's blood test results and what symptoms does she have?

"I was diagnosed based on blood test (positive SSA or SSB, I don't remember which) plus dry eyes confirmed by ophthalmologist and dry mouth. Because positive blood test and other signature symptoms, no need for lip biopsy. That's usually done when symptomatic but negative blood test. My rheumatologist prescribes meds for dry mouth as can a dentist."

"Most rheumatologists have patients try plaquenil first, and if that doesn't work then move on to chemotherapy. Those are usually prescribed if patient is having symptoms in addition to dryness, such as fatigue or joint pain."

"I would question the need to jump straight to chemo (I assume Methotrexate?) without trying less risky meds first.  For some low dose corticosteroids work, though it's not for all.  Like everything it has its own risks too.  Plaquenil helps with arthritis like symptoms and salagen or evoxac can help some people with dry mouth.  Keeping your teeth and gums clean is paramount in SS.  I get fluoride treatments every year to help ward off cavities even though insurance doesn't pay for it.  As for lip biopsy, I got diagnosed over 25 years ago and Schirmer's test, obvious dry mouth, and positive SSA/SSB and RF were good enough then.  Glad I didn't have to do that.  I've heard the criteria changed and not all docs are happy about it.  Keep educating yourself about the disease for your mom and stick with reputable sources.  There are a lot of people out there promising ""cures"" for a disease that is incurable."
I would seek a second opinion. I know a lot of rheumatologist that won't even do lip biopsies. Blood work and symptoms should be enough information for a diagnosis.
"Yeah, I'm worried. The doctor said it would be painless, and it would only be sore for a couple of days. But, I want to ask the doctor if my mom could avoid the biopsy all together, and have the other tests confirm her sjogren's."

Thanks. Advocating for my mom as a patient has made me want to become a doctor because I can empathize what it's like being on the other side.

"Honestly, a lot of times, doctors are intimidating. And I think the pitfall for a lot of patients is that we don't ask for second opinions or more questions, because we're afraid to look crazy and annoying."

"Doctors are people too, and are vulnerable to making mistakes."
"Thanks for the info. I'm not sure what to do now. Maybe we should go and talk to the rheumatologist. She is the doctor who initially referred us to the otolarynologist because my mom's mouth is dry, and she wanted my mom to go and get artificial saliva."

"Idk what would be better, chemotherapy vs. artificial saliva?"
"I will have to get back to you on that. We took the blood test on Friday. I wouldn't know how to access/read the results. I've only recently taken on the role as her caretaker, as my older sister moved away for college."

What are SSA and SSB? They are antibodies?

And my mom is not showing/feeling any signs of joint pain.

"I did a lot of research last night, and I found Xylimelts recommended by a lot of Sjogrens patients online. I went out to buy a pack for my mom, but she seemed hesitant to use them. I assured her there were no known side effects, and tried to explain how xylitol will help relieve her dry mouth symptoms, but she doesn't believe me. (English is not her first language, and as a result, does not know how to use the internet and look at resources/forums). She believes if they were effective, her doctor/dentist would of prescribed them already."
"Also, after reading about your moms symptoms I would be wearing of her starting a chemotherapy. That's just my opinion. I would defiantly research a rheumatologist that takes your mothers insurance and bring copies of her blood work."
[deleted]
"Artificial saliva would be wayyy less invasive. I'm surprised they're not starting there, however that would only help (potentially) that one symptom. Did they try any other autoimmune meds yet? They should exhaust those resources before even thinking about chemo. If her only symptom is mouth dryness, it'd make even *less* sense that they're so pushy with chemo"
"The problem with artificial saliva is that it is basically cover-up. It does nothing to actually deal with the disease the way chemotherapy would. My own personal experience is that artificial saliva isn't worth it. There are over the counter things that are cheaper and more effective, and depending on your insurance, they might not cover the artificial saliva at all or they may cover it if your mom has a proper work-up. The saliva can be very expensive (or it was when I took it 5 years ago)."

"Does your mother have really dry eyes? If she does, maybe she could have the eye tests instead of the lip biopsy. There are also tests to measure how much saliva she produces. Perhaps those tests would be better for your mom."
"Yes, SSA and SSB are antibodies. Here's a website helpful for understanding conditions and lab tests. https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/sjogren/start/2"

You can get lab test results by asking the doctor's office for a copy or accessing them online if the doctor's office participates in using electronic records. What was the nephrologist's diagnosis based on?

"Xylimelts are helpful. The doctor wouldn't ""prescribe"" them because they are over-the-counter meds and therefore don't require a prescription. It's important to use saliva producing products to protect teeth from bacteria (causes cavities and can lead to tooth loss) and aid digestion."

Sjogrensworld.org is another helpful resource with forums containing information as well as message boards. Here's a thread about other OTC products Sjoggies find to be helpful. http://sjogrensworld.org/forums/index.php?topic=10139.0
I wouldn't say xylitol has no side effects... it gives me instant diarrhea ;) but it certainly helps some folks!
Both ordered blood tests were confirmed positive.

"I actually advocated for my mom at her recent rheumatology appointment. I told the doctor that I asked a pathologist (a doctor I met through volunteering in the ER), thought I'd ask her for her opinion anyway since pathologist are the ones who read and assess the biopsy. The doctor shut me down and told me it was inappropriate of me to ask the pathologist and for the pathologist to answer... Which really upset me, but I was just in shock b/c... well, I didn't expect to be reprimanded for that by a physician."

"Anyway, both blood test came out positive, and the rheumatologist STILL recommends for the lip biopsy, which I think is dumb, and I want her (the mean doctor) to go suck it."
Thank you so much for the feedback and advice
Sorry to hear you are suffering. Did any of the doctors test your blood for SSA and SSB antibodies?
"I'm afraid I can't help with the diagnosis, but are you set up with eye drops and glycerin mouth gel?"
"Super dry mouth here...as far as dealing with it during the day...gum has been my lifesaver. At night, I have my humidifiers going and that seems to help. I had heartburn and ibs and was prescribed lansoprazole. It eventually went away and I actually don't have to take the lansoprazole anymore. As for work...I completely exhausted myself and ended up resigning...I probably should have asked for time off looking back...definitely be up front with your work about your condition, they will probably work with you, maybe giving you a little more flexibility. I ended up taking a part-time job, which honestly has made a huge difference. But I can't stay part-time forever unfortunately. But I do know what my limits are and what to look for in the future. Don't be too hard on yourself and take breaks when you need it :)"
I have not tried anything like this. But there are 35 reviews for this product on Amazon Quartz Silicone Shield for Nighttime Shelter https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IIFF29M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_vcaAybW3D9CSD

They seem to work in general as long as the pair fits you properly.
"Diagnoses are a bitch, hang in there kiddo =("

As for the procedure: you lay down on a scary-ass table. A needle with anaesthetics to your gums (eek!). After that you can't feel a thing and the doctor sort of rummages around in your mouth for a while and suddenly it's finished.
For the next couple of hours your mouth will feel numb and anything you say will sound absolutely ridiculous. Try not to drool. Good luck!
"your comment cheered me up so much :D I'm feeling much better the past few days. Like I've had mouth surgery before, I can totally do this. Thinking about whether the biopsy will be negative or positive isn't gonna help me at this stage as i've no control over it, I don't know when the biopsy is even gonna be - could be many months until it happens. Sure it will be fine - worst case scenario is it's negative and Ive to go back to the drawing board. Best case is its positive and I can get a frickin diagnosis. In the meantime, I'm going to see how I get on with plaquenil :) thanks for your help :)"
"Dental insurance in the US is a joke. If you can't appeal to your medical insurance for coverage because decay is due to SS, leave the country. Seriously. Medical tourism is a thing for a reason. There are plenty of qualified dentists in reputable clinics that will do the work for a fraction of the cost. I'm eventually going to need an implant which is 5k in the US and 1-2k everywhere else."
"Ugh, dental work. A lot and expensive with Sjogren's."

"I don't have financial advice for you but wanted to make sure your wife is aware of Salagen and Evoxac. They are prescriptions that help production of saliva which is important because saliva cleans teeth and reduces oral bacteria. The prescriptions can help prevent or reduce decay. If one doesn't work for her, she can try the other."
"Work with your dentist on a plan that also maximizes your insurance. I ended up spreading everything over a few years so that insurance would cover a good chunk of it, but first you need insurance. Dental insurance isn't that great, but it is better than not having any. Even if you decide to go to another country to have the work done, you should still get dental insurance to at least pay for the routine cleanings (and for any occasional cavities that might happen) she is going to need even once the main problems are sorted out."

"Good dental hygiene is so important as well. Cut down on things that tend to be really damaging to teeth. Consider using a fluoride toothpaste (I use regular Crest) or one for dry mouth. Also consider using an alcohol-free mouthwash with fluoride or dry mouth. Talk with the dentist for specific recommendations for your wife. Mine prefers me to use fluoridated stuff to strengthen the enamel, but her dentist may prefer using the dry mouth products instead. And of course floss daily too. I have peridontal disease and while there isn't much to one gain due once the gums have receded, I have been able to stop them from receding any further and have maintained that over several years now."

"There are many things to help with dry mouth too. Always carry a bottle of water and sip from it a lot. Use gums containing xylitol and/or Biotene oral gel for dryness. Put humidifiers around the house if you live in a dry climate. Medications can also help. I use a generic Salagene, but there are others."
"I just got 2/3 new crowns done myself. I had to wait for the new fiscal year for the third crown. I'm also using Care Credit, which is a medical credit card with no APR for the first six months, so that made it possible to space out the  bills.  I have a lot of friends who have successfully done the medical tourism route. If I were in her shoes that's probably what I'd do."
"You're not the first one to suggest it - all options are on the table, quite frankly."
"Nice, she's following this thread so I'm sure she'll take it to her Rheumy - thanks for the tip"

"Wow, thanks so much for the advice. We're working with her rheumy and her dentist now - I'll keep everyone posted on the outcome. Thank you!"
"Oh, another preventative thing is I get fluoride treatment after each cleaning."
"I have SS and produce plenty of saliva while eating...  It's more when it flares up I get fatigued and my mouth and eyes become dry.  Other times I'm fine.  I'd keep an eye on it, but ther could be other reasons you're having these experiences as well. (E.g. drug reaction, allergy meds, etc.)"
"I get dry eyes (the stinging can get really bad), mouth, and mucus membranes, as well achy joints, but tests for Sjogren's came back negative.  I think it is mostly my fibromyalgia issues, dehydration, and low humidity.  It might pay to get an antibody test run if you are really worried, but there are a lot of other things it could be such as minor sinus irritation, allergies, dry air, a fan, but I would expect symptoms to be worse.  Heck, mine nearly cripple me sometimes, and I don't have it.  I would be more suspicious if the symptoms were worse, or if you had another autoimmune issue or history.  Keep an eye on it, and keep a journal of symptoms.  Any doctor will want a history before running expensive tests."
"I guess I'm having a hard time knowing how ""dry"" is dry. I'm not on any medication and haven't really introduced anything into my diet. But I'll keep and eye on it for sure, thanks!"
"Thanks, I'm hoping it's a sinus thing... With Sjogrens I've heard symptoms can start out more mild and become serious later, so who knows."
Have you asked your doctor for Evoxac or Salagen? They are prescription drugs that help produce saliva. You can also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy. Other things to try are dry mouth spray and dry mouth mouthwash which are found in drugstore dental aisles.
"YES. I have a hard time swallowing and I often freak myself out and can't swallow (used to choke a lot before I got diagnosed). Drink a lot of water with your meals. If you are having a bad period, stick to softer foods like soup and rice and things like that to ease the anxiety."

"Makes it hard to take your pills, too. I really understand."

Are you on evoxac or salagen? I don't take either any more (bad side effects on me for some reason) but they really do work.
"I'd also love to know if this is a thing. My blood work came back positive for Sjogrens last month and now I'm waiting to see a rhuematologist next month. My symptoms sounds almost the same as yours. Dry eyes, chapped lips, dry nasal passage, swollen lymph nodes, and a damn post-nasal drip that won't quit. I bought a humidifier as well but it doesn't seem to do anything for me."
My most difficult problem is nasal dryness.

I have been treating it quite well with a humidifier. I was running it 24/7 when it was quite cold. Now that it's warmer I'm draining a tank 2 to 3 times a week.

My stop gap solution is to wear a face mask. The moisture from my breath helps to soothe my sinuses. It also protects me from wind.

"I have found that any sort of solution put into the sinuses just makes things worse. Anything with water seems to evaporate so fast and makes my sinuses painfully dry. Some gels sting too much, and others if used for too long prevent natural lubrication causing ""boom bust"" cycles of relief and painfully dry."

"I try to promote natural fluids to form. I stopped/changed medication that causes musosal dryness, like gabapentin and steroids. I take flaxseed oil and fish oil."

I haven't been diagnosed with Sjogren's. I have idiopathic dryness from head to toe. I won't be surprised if I am diagnosed in the next 5 years.
"Reflux (can be silent... meaning no heartburn) can also cause post-nasal drip or ""globus sensation"". Worth investigating at least! Hope you get to the bottom of it!"
"Wow, you have to wait 2 months to see a rheumatologist? I'm not looking forward to that."
I take fish oil as well which helped with dry eyes initially but I've been on it for a few years now so it's hard to say if it makes a difference with my dry sinuses. I'll look into a face mask when it's really bad.

"Also, I was on gabapentin for migraines/headaches but it actually made my headaches worse- perhaps the dryness was a factor that I hadn't considered. Thanks for your thoughts and suggestions."
Update: the doc said post-nasal stuff was unrelated for me…
"The gabapentin made my headaches A LOT worse, which I primarily attribute to the dryness."

I have noticed a strong correlation between my headaches and sinus dryness.
"This is suprisingly comforting to hear. I thought I was going crazy thinking the med I was taking to help my headaches was making them worse. My neurologist really wanted me to give gabapentin a fair chance, but after I went the whole month of october with only 6 headache-free days, she switched me to a different med."
I'm glad :)

I've been switched to Lyrica for my headaches. I haven't noticed any dryness from it yet. I'm currently at 150mg/day slowly raising 50mg/month until either the headaches go away or I hit 450mg/day.
"Hi there, I have fibro and sjogrens. The problem is that, just like with fibro, the symptoms can really vary from person to person. The majority of symptoms you're describing I've actually never had! My main issues are dryness and a weakened immune system. But that certainly doesn't mean you don't have it. Would your doctor be willing to do a blood test? That was how they originally found it for me (my symptoms developed a few years later)."
"I know it's difficult, but try to minimize stressing about it too much, as that could certainly increase symptoms (sjogrens related or not)."
You may want to get that lump biopsied.
"Hi, my parotid glands have been swelling up painfully during mealtimes and then slowly reducing back to normal for the past year and a half. My ENT was pretty confident that this was the result of a salivary stone and was looking for lumps like the one you're describing. (The fact that he can't find any has led to a neck CT yesterday and me thinking I have Sjogren's since I have a multitude of other symptoms that point to it - currently working on a diagnosis). Have you been to an Ear Nose and Throat doc or asked your PCP about the possibility of a salivary stone?"
Between my fibro and now this lump I've seen my doctor like 4 times in the past month. I saw a neurologist who was useless but my main doc also suggested I see a rheumatologist so I'm going to set up an appt on Monday.

"From what I have read and like you said, symptoms can very from person to person. I don't really have issues with dry mouth but I do get really bad dry lips and I drink water like a fish. (always thirsty)"


"I am not officially diagnosed with Sjogrens, but rather a blanket diagnosis of UCTD (suspected as Sjogrens and Lupus). This all started two weeks after our wedding-- obviously not great timing, but as some have reminded me, ""at least it happened after the wedding, and not before!"""

"At first my husband didn't say much. I would show him new symptoms, my hives, or try to explain what was going on. He would say ""I'm sorry"" and basically leave it at that. It made me feel like I was complaining or looking for pity, when in reality I was just trying to feel validated. Sometimes it feels like you're losing your mind, when new things start happening. It's hard to explain, but I wanted to share it with him so I didn't feel like it was just in my head. We finally had a breakthrough.. I started crying, telling him I was so sorry about all of it, that it's not fair he is having to make dinner every night because I literally cannot do anything but lay down and ice my hands... He told me that he just doesn't know what to say, and would take it all away if he could, but that he feels helpless."

"Once I put myself in his position, and realized how helpless he truly feels, I started letting him help me more. He knows that sometimes I just don't feel up to doing stuff. He says, ""what can I make you for dinner? Why don't you go lay down"" or, ""can I get you an ice pack?""."

"One of the hardest things about being ""chronically ill"" is the guilt that comes with it. When people ask you how you're doing and you have to lie because it's just easier that way. Otherwise you sound like a Debbie downer, and no one likes that. It's easier to just say ""fine"". I appreciate that he doesn't ask me how I feel. He knows if I am feeling bad I will tell him, and when I do tell him, he knows it's really bad."

"Maybe have a conversation about how he wants you to approach things, what you can do to help when he is in the middle of a flare, or if he wants you to ask how he's feeling, or explain that you want him to tell you, and you won't ask until he does?"

"If you haven't read the spoon story, look it up. I'm on mobile and can't. Just understand he has limited energy to put towards each day and exercise. If he chooses to use it on one thing, he won't have it for another. Ask if you can be involved in doctors visits, etc."

"Research Sjogrens and educate yourself on all the things it can affect. A lot of people think it's just ""dryness"" but it's not."

"Try to be patient because if he is working with a rheumatologist, he may be in the middle of finding the right combination of medications, and it can get better. Also, there's a good Sjogrens support group on Facebook. You could join it, or have him join it. Hearing other people with the same issues helps sometimes."


"A little background- I have primary sjogren's, have been diagnosed for almost 5 years. Often I have no energy, my joints hurt terribly, my eyes feel like they are on fire, etc., basically all the stuff.  Here is what I expect out of my husband:  Be understanding, treat me normally.  That's it."

"I know he's not magic. I know he can't make anything go away. Sjogren's syndrome does what it does and nothing he could do would prevent it. I don't want or expect him to wait on me.  Sjogren's can make you feel pretty terrible, and all that feeling terrible makes it really easy to fall down into a pit of self-pity and wallow there. I feel like if he coddles me too much, it would make it even easier to get into that mindset, and to me that would be worse than the sjogrens."

"For example, every fall we go to the renaissance festival, which I love. Often, I am in the midst of a sjogren's flair during that time. I go anyway, because F sjogrens. And I will walk around while my bones hurt until I can't walk anymore. Twice, we have had to leave after only being there a short time because I just could not walk anymore, the pain was too much. On those days, all I want is for him to just be understanding (which he is, very much so) that I have some limits and sometimes I just have to call it a day. The next few days when I feel bad, I just want him to treat me normally. Expect to see me sitting on the couch and hobbling around, but don't wait on me. And while I do appreciate empathy, under no circumstances do I want sympathy, because it makes it way too easy to feel sorry for myself. Keeping a positive attitude and living as normally as possible (even doing things when I don't have the energy and I KNOW I'm going to feel terrible afterwards) has been so vital for me in living with sjogren's and it's very important to me that my husband do the same."

"Obviously everybody is different, so I'd suggest just talking it over with him. Ask him to tell you exactly what he wants from you on those days, and do that."

"I agree with a lot of what the others have said. Honestly, you'll do both of you a huge favor by not trying so hard to make him be his old self. His life and way of being has permanently changed. That's not to say he can't do things to keep his quality of life high or even  do a lot of the same things but to a lesser degree. However, it's not your responsibility to ""fix"" him. Like the others have said, have an open conversation with him about what he needs/wants from you and genuinely believe him!"
"I started seeing a nutritionist and found out I have a TON of food sensitivities. She said that instead of thinking about what I can't eat, I need to focus on what I can and make the most of it. That's the perspective I take in relation to my new life. It's way more depressing to think about all of the things I can't do anymore (like stay out late, run, etc) than to think about everything I still can do!"

"The best thing my husband has done is simple support and acceptance. If I'm having a flare, he let's me rest. If I'm full of energy, we'll make the most of it. I think the best thing you can possibly to for him is ask him those questions you've posted here and let him know about YOUR feelings too! He may have a chronic diagnosis but you're in a partnership and need to take care of yourself as well."
"Every person I have ever loved has told me my illness is ""too much"" for them. So if you can do anything for him at all - just continue to love him and listen to him."
Yeah the disease has no cure. Yeah it gets progressively worse and worse. The only thing you can do is be there. It's more than the majority of humanity would give.
"The limited energy is the killer for me.  I am very active and he used to be too.  I don't mind going for a run on my own or going kayaking with friends instead of him... But I definitely feel guilty when I do.  He encourages me to go do what I want... That there's no use in both of our lives getting ruined.  Ultimately, I suppose he's right.  I just feel like your husband.  Utterly helpless."

"In fact, one of the things that really tears me up is how supportive of me he is.  He's over there struggling every day and is still being my cheering section.  How do I come close to reciprocating that strength for him?  It really feels impossible.  I feel lost in the maze of his hell."

"But you're right, when he let's me help with things more, I do feel better.  I will definitely bring that up.  There has to be some balance of me feeling useful and him not feeling helpless."
Thank you.  Thank you so much.

"Often we go out to a party or event and I KNOW he is going to be miserable the next day.  It makes me not want to go because I feel like of I get excited about it, he'll feel forced into going, feel terrible the next day, and it will be my fault.  But you're right... He shouldn't just willingly let his life stop, and I certainly shouldn't encourage him to just bow out and letting Sjogrens win!"

You really helped put things into perspective better.
"His diagnosis was less than a year ago, so it is still a very new thing for the both of us.  I like your attitude of focusing on what you can still do.  I see him try to do everything that he used to... try to keep up with me... try try try.  It's really heartbreaking at times.  For both of us.  I know that our lifestyle has to start changing, he just doesn't want to.  So, in the meantime, I am just trying to support him until he figures out what the new boundaries are."
"I'm really, really sorry to hear that.  Sometimes it feels like more than I can handle, like I'm giving up so much of my life to accommodate him when he's not feeling well.  Why?  Why am I doing this at all?  I just keep reminding myself that he's the same person he used to be before, only he lies to me less about how he's feeling.  That makes me feel pretty good.  I guess, it's just easy to focus on the negative impacts... I try to remember that there are also positives too, no matter how far and few between they may be."

"I hope you will find someone that can handle things better.  They're out there, don't get discouraged."
"I'm glad it helped! Sjogren's is not the end of the world (it really, really could be worse!) so it should not be the end of his living life either.  And it won't be like that every time forever. When the flares are bad, it can feel pretty bad, but when I'm not in a flare usually I feel ok, or ok enough. And if I'm exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet there are days that I feel great! It took me a few years to figure out what worked for me and what doesn't and it will probably be the same for him but once he figures it out and has adjusted to life w/sjogren's it's pretty manageable."
I completely understand! I just got my diagnosis within the year as well and it does take some time (and grieving!) to adjust. And it can be extremely difficult with how quickly symptoms come and go. Hang in there!
"I have noticed most the people who successfully found a supportive partner made their bond long before the illness set in. I developed SS in my early 20s. For a new relationship it skews the power dynamic too much. You are in some ways completely at the mercy of your partner because your life is, as you said above, ruined. At least it will never be the quality of life you lived before."
I can't have sex with my partners without suffering. I can hide it but it comes to light eventually. I might be able to find some supportive friends.
I wanted to follow up with - that you already recognize the severity of his illness will be one of the things about YOU that can see him through this personal hell. Not everyone with SS has it badly - when I was first diagnosed it didn't affect me badly yet.
"If people really saw day in day out every day how I'm ill they would know it's very bad but many people assume it isn't because it is invisible. I sometimes can't do anything at all - I can only be present and experience my pain in whichever system/s the SS is flaring. After that, I might have new permanent damages to my body or they might heal."
"You can't work together with someone on a problem you refuse to recognize. Since you do, it means you don't blame him or want to throw him away for having it, If you love him unconditionally you should take great joy in having a partnership where you can help him."
:( I'm sorry to hear you are having increase in symptoms. What did they give you for the neuropathy?
Ropinirole is what they prescribed for the RLS/PLMD and it seems to be helping with the neuopathy as well. That or the neupathy just happens to be worse when my legs are acting up.
"I don't have RLS. I have neuropathy in my hands and arms. It showed on an EMG the first year. Second year EMG showed improvement so now they have me listed under 'dysesthesia'.  I have no improvement of symptoms, just improvement on paper.  I am only on Gabapentin."

I wonder if anyone else here has RLS?

I'm glad it seems to be helping you in both issues. I love it when meds provide relief as intended.
"Yeah, it's been pretty good. This is one of the few things I've tried that the side effects weren't worse that the problem they were intended for. My sis, who also has a host of AI issues, has been dealing with neuropathy long than me, but she hasn't any success with medication helping either."
"23 yo female here with severe sjogrens. I have to use lube every time my boyfriend and I have sex, but it ends up being so much better anyways."
Welcome. Sjogren's is a hard disease to learn about except from our personal experiences. Asking others that have it is a great learning tool. I have learned more here and in sjogren's Facebook page then from any doctor. Ask away.

"Yes, I have problems of dryness during sex. I use lubricant. It can be annoying but it is better than being rubbed raw.  You can also get otc moisturizer for use other than during sex. Vagisil works well."

"If you are intimate with someone, tell them the truth. You have moisture sucking AI. If you're close enough for sex, you should be close enough to tell them that."

"Also, the lubricant will help them. The dryness makes it rough on both parties. Make it part of fore play. It can be fun."

"I think this is a point when you need to be frank and open. Actually work it into before you get there. ""Oh wow, SS sucks. Can you believe how much water I've drank."" Then you can mention how it affects all your moisture producing glands. Then when the time comes just be honest and straight forward and don't be embarrassed."
"I had one done a few months ago. It was done in ten minutes, but even as someone who is not afraid of blood or needles seeing a scalpel cut your mouth open is pretty nerve-racking! I actually almost passed out, but the doctor and her assistants were very good and had me feeling better in no time. It healed pretty fast, within a few weeks for sure. I'm not sure how much it cost as my insurance covered it. What's particularly interesting about my case is that as she was taking the biopsy the doctor said it looked extremely characteristic of Sjogren's, but the lab results came back negative. My rheumatologist diagnosed me nonetheless because of how severe my symptoms are."
"Thanks.  I've been trying to get the cost for the procedure from the hospital which has been challenging. Yeah, I'm worried about it being negative and then being back to square one."
"I feel like I'm always getting bumped back to square one, but hey, you've gotta keep trying."
"Don't stress out, as hard as that sounds! It will make your symptoms worse. I understand where you are coming from--I was diagnosed at age 11-12 and also have tons of medical issues. What helped me deal with it was once I got diagnosed, I thought about it like this:"

"""Nothing has changed. I didn't leave the doctor with a disease I didn't have before. My symptoms have always been there, and now there is just a name for them. Now that we have named it, we can treat the symptoms."""

"Basically, getting diagnosed is step 1 on your road to feeling a WHOLE lot better. Find a rheumatologist--this is their area of expertise. I promise they will help you so much."
"First *hugs*. Second it's very important to realize that your stress level can directly affect SS flairs so step back and do whatever it is that you need to calm yourself- mediation, prayer, exercise, chocolate, knitting or whatever."

"What should you tell them? Everything. It's pretty normal for SS to be present with other auto-immune disease, sometimes several, so they should know how to sift through everything. Positive ANA's are used with other things for diagnosis so that in itself doesn't tell you much.  Here's info on that.: http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Antinuclear_Antibodies_(ANA)/ I think your IC might even trigger that. (FYI, no one here is a medical professional.)"

"Typically they start you on plaquenil, but I don't think they like to put you on it while pregnant so they may start with something else since you're trying. For firm things to start with drink lots of water, sleep or rest as much as your schedule allows, find a good rheumy and a good dentist and eat as well as you can afford.  SS affects people differently and at different levels so asking specific questions would be a great way for us to help you."
Thank you! That's a great way to look at things. I have an appointment with a rheumatologist on July 3rd (earliest they had). My primary referred me to this particular office so I'm hoping they are good there. I'm nervous as a lot of docs over the years didn't take me seriously.
"Thank you! Thanks for the link, that's helpful. I assume because the SSA antibody came back positive that I definitely have SS? At least that's what my primary doc thought. I just hope I get some sort of definitive answer at the specialist in a few weeks."

"I do exercise a lot, and drink TONS of water (mostly because I'm thirsty all the damn time). But I'd have to say my stress over the last year has been through the roof! I had surgery in December (directly related to fertility stuff) and have just had a bunch of very stressful things happen. I have an anxiety disorder that was pretty under control but got quite exacerbated in the last 6 months to a year."

Thanks again for the advice and info. I was feeling so lost and very happy to stumble across this subreddit.
"I promise a rheumatologist will take you seriously! The only reason I was diagnosed so young was because my teeth were literally fillings, no tooth left, and I would ALWAYS choke on my food when I was eating because I didn't realize that my mouth was so dry--I was only 7 or 8 when I started to notice it anyways!"

Just a heads up on some awesome treatment options that have worked for me:

1. Evoxac: its a pill you take that makes you spit more! Side effect: it makes me feel like im kind of sweaty and my heart beats fast. I save that for bad days.

2. Numoisten lemon lozenges: they taste good and help you spit more.

"3. Biotene mouth wash: it moisturizes your mouth, but the taste/texture is kind of weird."

4. Prescription toothpaste with tons of fluoride in it

5. GelTears or GenTEAL eye drops/eye gel for when you sleep. Helps with the dryness a lot.

"6. Depending on your bloodwork, you may get put on something like prednisone (a steroid that helps calm down the inflammation in your body from your immune system attacking itself) or Plaquinil (Hydroxychloroquinine). It was originally used for malaria, but back in they day they noticed people who took it for malaria who also had rheumathoid arthritis or lupus felt a LOT better. This one has very few side effects."
You're welcome. You could always call back and ask about your test result and get clarification.
"Thanks, this is SO helpful! I need those eye drops ASAP! Are they over the counter or prescription? I stood in the ""eye care"" aisle the other day completely lost as to what what would help, so thanks for that! I might need some of the mouth stuff too. I drink like 2 or more liters of water at least a day! I may not be able to do the ""prescription"" stuff as I'm going through fertility treatments though :/"
Well it was my primary (she's a CRNP) so she didn't know a whole lot of details which is why she is sending me to a specialist. She is awesome though and am eternally grateful that she took my complaints seriously and was the one who suspected SS initially. I just got a copy of the lab report in the mail today to bring to the rheumatologist. I definitely have the SS symptoms so that would make sense...
"Over the counter! GenTEAL makes drops And they also make a gel but I don't like the gel, I hate goop in my eyes. Gel tears are AWESOME. Unfortunately the stuff is kind of expensive--anywhere from 8-17 bucks a pop but its worth it. They also sell it at Costco and sams club which I would recommend looking into because you're gonna go through a lot!"

"Ask your dentist if they have biotene samples. Mine does--they give me a little package with mouth wash, tooth paste, mouth moisture wipes, etc"
A professional that listens makes all the difference in the world.
"Fabulous! I have a BJs membership so they might have it there. I'll definitely check. I conveniently have a dentist appointment next week so I'll be sure to ask them! All of this is really awesome, thanks again!"
Let's see [here it is on Amazon for 1.99.](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IZPQ82) [Here is the recap.](http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Lucky_Thirteen)
I remember this one.  I wasn't diagnosed yet so didn't pay much attention to the disease.  Full of Thirteen's drama.  Reading the recap is scary!
"The only daily RX I take is plaquenil. I also take D and a multivitamin.  I have a prescription painkiller, but I only take when even sitting is too painful.  I've also radically changed my diet. I rarely eat junk food now and I found out I'm gluten intolerant so that's actually helped a lot. My digestive issues, unrelated to SS, cleared up but so did some of the joint pain.  I was rather surprised at that. I've found chiropractic care helpful, but you have to be really careful about finding a good one. Many really want you to buy this latest thing or a new treatment or something.  I can't really offer you any help on that last bit.  SS is sorely underreasrched and underfunded."
"She takes D and a multivitamin as well.  She has had reflux, but that was due to a medication that she used to take.  That girl has an iron stomach otherwise.  She hasn't tried a chiropractor yet, but its definitely something to consider. Thanks!"
I love Body Shop's Aloe line.  I have tried:

*calming face wash- I love it but replaced it with something less expensive.

*toner- I adore it. It immediately soothes and cools my skin which is awesome.

*am and pm facial lotions- I like them but they weren't moisturizing enough.

"*exfoliator- Meh, not worth the money. It didn't irritate my skin, but it wasn't rough enough to really exfoliate either."

*mask- Now this is worth it's weight in gold.  I actually use it as a moisturizer.

*lip stuff- Not worth the expense.

I've got two new products I picked up yesterday.  I saw someone else with SS post elsewhere about using Burt's Bees cuticle cream so I'm trying that. I also saw a BB lip balm with mango that looked interesting so I picked that up as well.
The Brita filter water bottle.  It goes everywhere with me!
"* Carmex  I have a big problem with sores in the corners of my mouth.  If I put it on at bedtime and first thing in the morning, they don't start."
"* Vaseline Spray Lotion  It is great for putting on when getting out of the shower.  Or a quick moisture touch up on the way out the door.  Not good for the real moisturizing times, but for ease of use and quick fixes, I love it."
"I really need to start taking better care of myself when it comes to the little things.  I use lotion on a regular basis.  Mostly on my arms and shoulders.  Lubriderm has a new line of lotions marketed toward men.  They have a ""manly"" scent.  I like it.  It's not overpowering like any of that Axe crap.  I can put a decent amount of lotion on my arms, and the scent is subtle enough to keep you from smelling like a douchebag."
"My doctor just suggested I try xylimelts as the pilocarpine isn't doing the trick on its own. They are dissolvable tablets that actually stick to your gum until they melt and make it feel like I used the Biotene gel, without the icky feeling. They don't last as long as it says on the package, maybe a few hours, but they are nice, and you can sleep with them in and not choke."
"I really love Blink brand ""gel tears."" They moisturize my eyes better than regular drops, but I hate the actual gel you can put in your eyes because it is slimy and drives me nuts."

Biotene makes an AWESOME mouth wash that helps my mouth feel moist.

"I also got a prescription ""magic mouth wash"" from my doctor that helps when I have sores in my mouth."

"He also gave me some prescription lemon drops called ""numoisten."" They are fabulous! I believe they were developed at the university of minnesota though, so they may not be available everywhere."

EDIT: has anyone tried the prescription 'evoxac'?
I've not heard of Vaseline Spray Lotion. I will look for it. Thanks!
"The little things can really make you feel a bit better and sometimes those small degrees can really help.  BTW keep a watch on the scented lotion. Often they contain alcohol which can dry your skin.  Gold Bong Ultimate lotion has a good fragrance free one, although it's really heavy."
I like the idea of having something you can use overnight.
I've not tried evoxac.
"My dermatologist swears by Neutrogena with Helioplex.  Prefers I use 100 SPF, but currently I'm using 70 SPF.  I'm very fair skinned & burn easily, but lately when out for more than a few minutes, I can literally feel myself swelling in response to the sun & heat.  Not happy as I also have Seasonal Affective and barely make it through Ohio winters."
I think weekly discussions work the best while our subscriber count is low.

I stay out of the sun as much as possible.  The sun/heat makes me feel more run down and dries me out more.
"I avoid the sun. I get dehydrated so easily. I wear long sleeves in the winter and copious amounts of sunscreen as it warms up. I do break out without sunscreen and I did that before medication. I'm currently using Coppertone Water Babies Pure & Simple 50, but I'm not in love with it."
I have not had problems with sun sensitivity until recently.  I am hoping it is because of the non stop antibiotics.  I was planting some rose cuttings and doing general yard puttering and burned.  One more ache to deal with.
I guess I will start with sun block.  I do not want to give up my yardwork.  So a little more care now.
Do you like the sunscreen?  Do you swell despite it?
"Thanks, I just realized I totally forgot to answer this myself.  The sun makes me super tired too."
"I don't have Diabetes, but I have PCOS.  SS seems to have a high co-morbidity with everything though."
"I don't know but it seems to overlap with a lot of other autoimmune diseases like RA and Fibromyalsia.  I have Primary and an undecided second which the doctor says is most likely Lupus or Fibro.  I don't have enough symptoms for him to make a descision though and, according to him, it doesn't make that much difference since he'd treat them the same anyway. :/"
"The only difference between primary and secondary is that with secondary you also have other auto immune diseases.  So positive for Sjogren's is positive.  Lupus is often misdiagnosed.  My daughter has it/doesn't have it, depending on the doctor."
I have secondary Sjogren's and Hashimoto's and Fibromyalgia and dysautonomia.  Possibly CVID and Lupus.
Good luck to you.
"I don’t find water to be very moisturizing. I do a lot of oil pulling with MCT oil, and drink a lot of herbal teas. I still drink water to stay hydrated, but it’s not very hydrating for the mouth itself."
Water with a little bit of olive oil helps me.
"I have trouble drinking water sometimes also.  I find that coconut water or soup broth works much better - I think because the oil helps moisturize the throat.  Sports drinks and tonic water also work every now and then.  Better than water, anyhow."
"I got them inserted in 2017 and they have been life changing for me. The doctor plugged the bottom punta and that was good for a bit but after just a few days the dryness was worse than before. I went back to the doctor who said some people need to top puncta plugged, too, so she did that and it's been great ever since. Made the difference between being able to continue to work or having to scale back severely or quit. Pretty easy procedure."

"If the plugs work well, some people choose to have their puncta cauterized so they are permanently closed."
I've had them for almost a year. Have helped tremendously. My regular eye dr inserted them in her office.
"I have them.  Never been diagnosed with Sjogren's but starting to strongly suspect it.  They gave me the plugs after LASIK.  Not sure whether it was the plugs or the getting rid of contacts that helped, but my eye dryness has improved by like 80%.  That was in 2010 & I'm still doing well."

The insertion?  Not so fun.  But there are worse things.  AMA if you like.
Have 3 of my 4 permanently closed and going to get the last one done in about a month. It has been a life saver. Did the plugs for awhile but they kept falling out and it was getting pricey.
"well, went in for my appointment today, doctor put in the plugs! My eyes feel fine about an hour after, no irritation,  he did tell me there’s lots of damage and inflammation to the inside of my eyelids which was news to me :(. Hopefully the plugs work out as well for me as they do for you!!"
hey! i actually got the plugs in during my consult! they’ve been in 4 days now and my eyes feel awesome! i wish i’d done this way earlier!
"I hope they do, too. Good luck!"
Niiiiice!  I never knew such a thing existed or I would've too!  Very weird thing when you think of it.  So glad they're working for ya.
I’ve been stalking this post and I was hoping someone would reply to you :(

"I just started Cevilemine and it has drastically improved my quality of life. My husband and I want to start a family within the next year and I am wondering the same thing. I feel like this is a necessary drug, but I wouldn’t want to harm my baby. I spoke to my Rhuematologist and he cautioned the use of it during pregnancy, but didn’t get into too many details."

"Were you able to find any information on this? Obviously everything I find says no, only if absolutely necessary."
"To be blunt, we really can't know."

"If it is an autoimmune illness (e.g. Sjogren's), there is currently no cure for them. A lot of people get worse, but some people do have certain symptoms that come and go."

"If it's some other cause, well, it may be treatable, it may not."

"Some things have medicines or other treatments that improve symptoms, some don't."
"Ask your doctor about taking a magnesium supplement. I had some neurological issues, mostly muscle spasms, that were greatly improved by taking magnesium."
Any chance you had brain fog that was helped by magnesium too?
"Thanks for your recommendation, I bought a magnesium supplement and I believe its helping!"
I also use magnesium in both supplement form and as a lotion. Magnesium Malate is the form I use and it helps me fall asleep at night and to relieve muscle cramps and spasms. I also take Zinc lozenges at night as well that help
"I had LASIK done,  but this was about a year before I was officially diagnosed. The Ophthalmologist knew about my eye dryness, but it didn’t prohibit me from getting it done. I use lubricant eye drops 1-3 times a day now, similar to before."
It is not recommended for people with Sjogrens.

"There are plenty of cases where someone did LASIK, and later got diagnosed with Sjogrens, but manage okay with artificial tears and/or prescriptions like Restasis. I had manageable dry eye and planned on doing the procedure, but my dryness got worse after 5 years and I eventually got diagnosed with Sjogrens. I’m glad I didn’t do the procedure because I don’t know how I could manage eyes any dryer than they are now. If you know you have an autoimmune condition that affects your mucus membranes and will likely cause dry eyes at some point, you shouldn’t do the procedure. You should discuss this w your rheumatologist first and foremost."
"I had LASIK done about ten years before my diagnosis (I actually stumbled across my LASIK paperwork yesterday). I doubt I'd do it if I knew I had Sjogren's, especially knowing what I know now. In fact, when I had my LASIK done in 2006, I was four years away from being so sick that I got doctors involved. I knew I tended to have dry eyes, which is why I stopped wearing contact lenses years ago, but at that time I had no idea what was behind my dry eyes."

"It is probably a bad idea, but I'd check with whichever doctor is helping you manage your illness if you want to be absolutely sure."
"I had LASIK 4 months before I was diagnosed in April. Back in December, they did a Schirmer's test to make sure my eyes weren't too dry (it's just their normal procedure to do the test). I had a little dryness before, but I always blamed it on my contacts. My Schirmer's test was 6mm. According to my rheumatologist, 5mm is considered Sjogren's. The LASIK surgeon did the surgery because I told him I wasn't bothered by dry eye. Though he did say that if I am ever, he'll block my tear ducts and that should help."
"At the time, I hadn't even heard the name Sjogren's. It wasn't until my dentist suggested it four months later that I started looking that way to explain my current months-long flair up."
"Wow this is very reassuring. Did you just have dry eye or any other symptoms like redness, swelling, blepharitis, ect"

"I feel like I’m detached and in a fog when I wear glasses, but I can’t wear contacts"
"I have dry eyes with redness. I very rarely experience swelling. I don’t get blepharitis, but I get styes a couple times a year. My LASIK procedure was 7 years ago and I’m still very pleased with it!"
Maybe give oil cleansing method a try.
"To be honest, I stick to all natural products because of how sensitive my skin is. I find Weleda as a brand really good. I use their calendula face cream and almond face wash."
"I have kinda similar skin and the lotion that has helped me is Avène Hydrance Optimale Rich Hydrating Cream, also other Avène’s products have been good for me."
I use Thayer’s Witch Hazel with lavender before bed every night. It’s really gentle and then I have a Sleep Facial that I put on. It’s called KORRES Wild Rose Vitamin C Brightening Sleeping Facial. It’s basically a really thick face cream that you put on before bed and then I can make it to the morning feeling hydrated. From here I have another face cream. I usually stick with night creams because they hydrate better than the day creams.
"Ponds! My nighttime routine is ""washing"" my face with the cold cream cleanser, then applying a light layer of the dry skin cream moisturizer."

This is seriously the only thing that keeps my painful itchy bumpy red skin at bay.

"(Also, stop exfoliating. It's too harsh for our skin)"
"OMG I have so many suggestions. I thank the good folks at SkincareAddiction for why my face is not a mess even during a flare. The key is GENTLE HYDRATION. A lot of fancy lotions have other unnecessary ingredients that are irritating. I buy all mine at Walgreens or online. Sunscreen makes a big difference. Redness is usually because your moisture barrier has been stripped, so focus on building that back up and your face won't need to overproduce oil to compensate."

&#x200B;

Here is my routine:

AM:

"\- Gentle cleanser, like Cetaphil"

"\- Hydrating ""toner"" like Rosewater + Glycerin. I buy mine from Whole Foods."

"\- Hyaluronic acid based serum. I use The Ordinary's version, but Neutrogena or others make one too."

\- Gentle lotion - I like La Posay-Roche but Cerave is great too

\- Suncreen with zinc and/or titanium dioxide

Option: Vitamin C serum after cleanser - but will make you more photosensitive!

&#x200B;

PM:

\- Oil cleanser to get off makeup

\- Gentle cleanser

"\- Toner, like Thayer's Witch Hazel. Don't use anything super astringent. Personally, I love Innisfree Green Tea Seed Skin. It's watery, and you pat it on after cleansing. But it makes your face feel super soft and happy! Can use any time of day."

\- Niacinimide + Zinc + Hyaluronic Acid (I get mine from the Ordinary) Optional

\- Gentle lotion. The key here is creating a seal for the moisture you have already added back in with gentle cleansing and toning.

"\- Eye cream if you want - I switch mine up. I even use some cheap E.L.F. stuff, lol"

"Option: BHA or AHA exfoliating serum after cleanser. I use Cosrx's, but The Ordinary, Pixi, bunch of options. That will take off the bumps and you only need it 2x week. ONLY USE ONCE YOUR FACE IS NICE AND HYDRATED AGAIN"
Added to my list! :-) Thank you.
I bought some of the face cream and will try it out. Thank you.
Thank you! I appreciate the information.
"Thank you, I really appreciate the tip. I used witch hazel before but worried that it was dehydrating my skin. I guess with cream added after that, it would really help."
"Thank you, I added those to my list! I'm curious, without exfoliation I'm not sure how I can get the dry peel materials off my face? Or do you mean just hard exfoliation? I'm open to ideas."
I hope it works out for you :)
I really hope you find something that will work for you. I completely understand the struggles. I hope and believe for you.
I don't use any gritty or chemical exfoliants.
"Rather, I slather the cold cream all over my face, and gently rub in circular motions with my fingers so it ""melts in"".  Then I gently wipe it off with a warm wet washcloth, which is plenty to get the flaky skin off."

I'm thinking your skin is flaky because it's so dry and delicate at this point.  Switching to an oil-based cleanser (like Ponds) will drastically reduce the flakes :)

"Edit: Ponds has a new product out, a ""Cleansing Balm"".  I like the way it feels, but it's still not enough moisture for my skin.  I'm literally stuck with the cold cream cleanser :)"
Thanks for that additional info. I feel so much more confident after asking! Lots to try but also lots of good to hope for. :-) Have a great weekend.
Do you have muscle pain?

"CK elevation is usually related to myositis (aka muscle pain). Next step would be to repeat blood work (make sure not a one-time abnormality) and if positive again, see a neurologist and have an EMG done."

Did you have your ESR and CRP - inflammatory markers - taken during same lab workup?

"Sjogren’s is a connective tissue disease, myositis overlap is on rarer side of manifestations, but not exceptionally rare."

Low IG levels as in total IgG? That could be sign of primary immune deficiency.
Did they check IgG total and sublevels?
"There is IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4."

"Let me know, glad to help."

[Sjögren’s Syndrome Imitating Inflammatory Myopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6279011/)
What is CK?
I have low Ig levels. I have to see an immunologist for it. My CK is fine.
Creatine Kinase. Higher levels indicate muscle damage
Interesting. I'm going to glance over my blood work and see what it says!
"Yep, took it for about 3 months (it seems longer but I'm pretty sure I only got it refilled 3 times), didn't notice anything."

"In hindsight, I may have been taking too much (doc started me on 4mg)."

"Its worth noting that the symptom I was looking for help with is small fiber neuropathy (which is really bad for me), so if it helped with any other symptoms I might not have noticed."
I tried it for about 6 months or so. Don’t remember the exact dosage but it was maybe 2-4mg. My ophthalmologist prescribed it to help with inflammation/dry eye. I discontinued it since I didn’t notice a difference and having it specially compounded was quite expensive.
"I'm on 25 mg/day. My dry mouth and eyes are worse, so far, but it has only been two weeks."
Hello I just started my LDN been on 1 mg for only 5 days and have already had enough positive effect that if this is all I get I’ll stay on it. Hoping for more improvements of course. It’s my only pharmaceutical at the moment but I’m scheduled to start ivig. I may hold off on ivig until I can measure the full effects. I think it’s worth trying
ugh I have SFN as well! What is helping me now is a compounded supplement of mostly B vitamins and minerals my doctor has designed based on metabolic deficiencies and excesses I have had very. low zinc and  high copper ( which itself can cause AI) the side effect. is it is reducing oxidative stress and my neuropathy pain is not as noticeable. When I go off for significant. amounts of time (1-2 months) my pain is pretty bad. Acupuncture also helps my SFN pain but can't do that all the time. Im sorry. LDN didn't help you. It seems to help some people a lot some a little and half not at all.
that is a good go of it. Im sorry it. wasn't helpful to. you. Im going to try it b/c its a pretty. benign option. I wish more would try it so we could get more intel on its effectiveness if only anecdotal. I hope you. find something that helps you.
That sounds like more than most use. Most stay between 1-4 mg . I hope it helps
"It is, but it is much cheaper. At 1mg it was $90 for a month's worth because it had to be special ordered. The higher dose is only $16 per month. 1 mg did nothing for me."
Ohhh 😮 def a consideration I just thought lower dose range was how it was effective. Interesting
"Sjögren's Syndrome is associated with a dry mouth. Diabetes is associated with thirst. They are two entirely different symptoms and very distinct from one another. I have both type one diabetes and Sjögren's Syndrome. Your symptoms lean towards diabetes, but I would assume that they tested your blood sugar early on. If not, get that done, especially with those eye changes."

"The hypermobility and stretchy skin caught my attention, both you and your sister. You may want to poke around r/ehlersdanlos as that disorder comes with a lot of other issues, including dysautonomia (cardiovascular changes). I think that you will fit in there and they're super helpful."

"I agree that you should see a rheumatologist, but first find out if your blood sugars have been tested. Another clue to potential diabetes would be that the thirst, blurry vision, dryness, etc would be worse when you eat carbs/sugars. Sometimes, people live with undiagnosed diabetes for a long time before it's noticed."

Best of luck to you!

"Edited to add that salt cravings are associated with adrenal issues. Have your cortisol levels been checked? I don't know that this helps you, but I thought it worth noting."
"Hi!  Have you been tested or diagnosed with Sjogrens?  If not, it's probably worth asking for a referral to a rheumatologist. It's frustrating when you have symptoms all over the board, but that may be the specialist to begin bringing it all together. If diagnosed, they may be able to offer different options to address symptoms and also take a closer look at your issues with hypermobility."
"I have sjogrens and can relate to never feeling thirsty, I don’t know if it’s caused by that or not but I’ve been that way for so long and have to force myself to drink. But dry mouth and joint pain are some of my biggest symptoms, do you have either of those? You said you do have saliva but it just feels dry? That’s weird, almost like a cotton mouth situation. For me I just have a lack of saliva. The symptoms that got me diagnosed were my salivary glands just under and in front of my ear will get blocked and swell up huge for a day, and my white blood cell count is always low so that also got the docs interested in doing blood tests. Definitely try to see a rheumatologist so you can be sure."
Hi crossboneslife.

"oddly, I had a few high blood glucose measurements. But they were only high when I was extremely dehydrated (thus when I had one of those flare-ups where I could not stop peeing), otherwise completely normal. I also had further tests, like longterm sugar, a glucose challenge test: all completely normal as well. I have one blood sugar test with a test stick that was normal, and elevated in the serum test taken seconds later. Never elevated glucose in urine."

"I found this article a while ago which seems to suggest that dehydration might lead to increased blood glucose, but mainly in serum: https://www.practicaldiabetes.com/article/effect-dehydration-blood-tests-2/"
"I can't find it now, but I once read a second article going more into depth with this, again focussing on glucose, electrolytes and lipids and how they might be elevated when dehydrated."

"If I would constantly pee large amounts and constantly feel the same I might want to consider something like diabetes insipidus, or one of those hormones that control kidney function, but my problems fluctuate as badly as my thyroid, which makes me wonder whether they could be autoimmune-related. It's like: one week/month they swing towards excessive thirst, the other towards no thirst at all regardless of what I do. One week/month I might steal a salt block from a horse, the other I can't stand salt. One week/month every movement seems to make the skin on my fingers crack and everything else (other than mouth) is superdry, the other it's at least bearable. One week/month I seem to be losing electrolytes like crazy, the other they seem to stick. It's just crazy."
"Oh, you mentioned sugar: Nope, does nothing. For ages I thought these sudden bouts of confusion, weakness etc were related to low blood sugar. Fits the description perfectly. But blood sugar is normal, and eating sugar does nothing. Also doesn't do anything for dryness or other problems."

"Morning cortisol was tested once, and was completely normal. While pretty much every electrolyte was low at one point or another, salt was always middle of the range. It was never tested when I was craving salt like crazy though. Thus no idea if something is different then."
"Ok, I'm in a thirsty phase again it seems. It's not so much thirst, but... odd. Imagine desert soil after the summer, baked hard and solid. Then it rains for a short moment and the water just stands there on that solid surface, then runs off or evaporates without doing anything to that soil. That's how it feels. I have saliva in my mouth but all of my mouth, throat, oesophagus feel dry. I drink and nothing changes, I want an icecold beer (I don't drink beer, mind) as I feel it will change something but I know it won't. I put moisturiser on my hands, and there's a slippery layer on my hands  but the skin still cracks underneath."
"Nope. I lived in the Middle East first when this problem became acute. In a country with no endocrinologist other than diabetes experts, and 6 months waiting times to see a rheumatologist. Then in the UK, and well.. NHS.. do I need to say more?"
"I have raynaud syndrome, though fairly mildly in hands, rather bad in toes. Runs in the family as my mom and her mom had it as well, though a lot worse. I usually find it difficult to get my fingers moving in the morning and been having rather bad finger joint pains that lasts for 1-2 weeks a few times per year for years. Never been investigated other than a negative test for gout (not expected otherwise as I hardly eat trigger foods)."

"Wiki (I know, not an authority) mentions that an early onset symptom might be excessive saliva. So who knows... cotton mouth really describes it. It's so odd, having saliva but a dry mouth at the same time. My thyroid and contraceptive pills regularly get stuck somewhere in my esophagus even though I've already chosen brands that are less porous than others."

"Plus there are occasional periods of acidosis that gets me in hospital if very severe, otherwise it's just an annoyance that results in yet more loss of fluid, plus potassium, bicarbonate and magnesium loss. Anion gap and delta suggests it's primary and not a compensation for a too high pH."
"My pills get stuck in my esophagus too it's so annoying. I try to chug water when I take them and it's usually fine but I had these antibiotics once that got stuck every time and one day it caused these really painful spasms for like an hour.... lame. But anyway, yes I have raynauds too, it seems to come with a lot of autoimmune problems. Well, you said you have hashimotos right? So you're definitely at risk of others AI's so it's good you're keeping a look out. I believe a normal doctor can order the blood test? I know they will send you to a rheumy for an actual diagnosis but with the help of the internet you can probably read the lab work."

Have you checked recently to make sure your thyroid levels are good? I know an out of balance thryoid causes soooooooo many symptoms.

"It's definitely lack of saliva and lack of tears that are the hallmark signs to look out for, but of course you will only know if you get checked out. And keep an eye out for lupus too."
Thanks :) I'm seeing my new GP next week so lets see what comes out of it. Reading along here made me add a few more things to my symptom list that I never considered to be a symptom for anything.

"Well.. thyroid is an ongoing thing.. it's usually fine, but every now and then I fall into a big hypo (glad the blood test caught it before I started feeling bad) or a hyper (yay, my flat is never cleaner than when I'm in a hyper ;) )"

"So lets see how things go at my GP. I heard that GPs here are as adamant to refer to specialists as in the UK, and tend to suggest to just take a paracetamol if you don't feel well.. so lets see."
I’ve used Vidisic Carbogel (I live in the Netherlands; never heard of Xiidra). I don’t use Vidisic anymore since my dry eyes got worse. I have ciclosporine eyedrops now and hardly need to supplement with regular eye drops at the moment.

"I know it’s an annoying reply, but did you contact an eye doctor for advice? That really helped me so far :) I’m replying to you because I recently joined Reddit and I see this subreddit exists but sadly doesn’t appear to be very active."

Good luck!
"My opthamologist also recommended a heat pack on my eyes for five minutes at a time, four times daily. It is soothing, and assists my eyes with keeping my oil glass fluid."

"My “hot pack” is s clean, white sock, filled with white rice. I hear it in the microwave for a minute or so, then lie down with it across my eyes."

The dr. explained to me that my eyes should have a thin film of oil to hold tears in place. Not only do my eyes make zero tears (really. Zero.) but the oil film is the consistency of Crisco in the winter. I find the hot packs to be soothing and effective.

Hoping for the best for you.
"If anyone wants to purchase Xiidra, pm me for details. I have full unused boxes (12 pouches each box). I'll ship to you for free (USA)."
"Yes, Xiidra is a newer prescription drop that competes against cyclosporine eyedrops (known as Restasis in the US). My doc had me try Xiidra first, although I *might* end up taking both drugs combined if this keeps up. Thanks for the reply."
"Huh, that's interesting. I don't totally understand how a heat pack would help, but I'm happy to give it a try! And yes, I'm right there with you in the ""zero tears"" camp, lol."
"If our eyes did not have a thin layer of oil over the top if our tears, we would constantly weep tears. In my case, due to Sjögren’s, my oil is thick, more like crisco than oil. Heating my eyes melts the crisco-like texture of my oil to the more natural fluid-like consistency. I am no ophthalmologist, but this is my best understanding of what my ophthalmologist told me."

"Also, on a side note, my dr has limited my use of OTC tears to four times/day. There is an excellent, but expensive OTC product called, “Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye Ointment “. It blurs your vision, but is for use just before bedtime. It can be quite helpful."

Hope you find relief.
> has limited my use of OTC tears to four times/day

Interesting. I would probably die if I were limited to four times a day.

> Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye Ointment

Thanks. I'll give this a try.
"I have been on the serious gut healing journey for about three years, unfortunately it hasn’t healed my autoimmune disorders or changed how I feel that much."

"For dry throat and lungs stuff, get yourself an air humidifier. I bought one a while ago and haven’t since woken up because of my awfully dry mouth and throat during the night."
Go see an eye dr and get a script for Xiidra. Really great eye drops for me.  Use twice a day. Over the counter option is refresh eye drops.

Ask your dr for cevimeline it’s a drug for dry mouth. Works good for me.

"For dry nose, use Ayr nasal spray/gel."
"For your eyes: My eye doctor prescribed me Hylan eye drops, 6 times a day when i was diagnosed a year ago. Then,  2 months ago at another check up,  she assessed i needed more than this: so she prescribed me with Vidisic Carbogel... an eye gel i use 3 times a day.  This combination is working and gives me relief from my burning eyes."
"(I'm in the Netherlands, so google will tell you the name of these meds are in your country)"
Bottom line: you need prescription from your eye doctor

## Panel Remarks

"The presence of the antibody(ies) at the level(s) reported suggests that the patient is likely to have Sjögren's syndrome, especially if associated with clinical symptoms of dry eyes and/or dry mouth. Clinical follow-up with a rheumatologist, eye care professional (ophthalmologist or optometrist), and oral medicine specialist is recommended for further patient management."
Ask for Evoxac or Salagen prescription.
Thanks for asking. :)

He ordered more blood tests to rule out other autoimmune diseases. He saw my salivary glands are swollen and told me to see an ENT. He prefers that I continue with Hashimoto's prescreption for a couple more months to see if anything improves or not before making a diagnosis.
Should I not ask for more tests first?
Sounds good. Hopefully things calm down and you don't have Sjogren's.
Your doctor may want to have more information before diagnosing. https://labtestsonline.org/conditions/sjogren-syndrome
I find that good omega fats like fish oil and sea buckthorn make a huge impact on my eye symptoms. I always like to give a shout out to AIP too and figuring out the inflammatory food triggers in your diet.
I get that eye twitch occasionally... Usually I up my magnesium intake and that helps make it subside. It is massively annoying!

"As far as testing, you have two choices. Ask your regular doctor for an ANA. If positive, insist on further testing aa referral to a rheumatologist for official diagnosis. Or, go to your eye doctor and ask for the Sjō test. Only eye doctors have access to that one for some reason. Call around and ask before you go. The test is a couple of years old, and according to some docs I've talked to, pretty good at identifying Sjogren's."


I have positive ANA and my Neurologist has ordered a lip biopsy to test.  If your Dr is hard to get in with you could ask for a referral to a Rheumatologist.  Good luck
"The eye doctor can do the test? I will ask the eye doctor then, thank you. He will be easier to see and more helpful than my PCP. He can also recommend any other tests for the eye doctor."

"I should have mentioned I already take magnesium (500 mg), potassium, and calcium, as well as Vitamins B and D, because of my other health conditions. Any upping the magnesium, and I would be running to the rest room!"

"My thought is that this is Sjogrens, or else something to do with diabetes (not treated, still ""pre-diabetic"" as I'm one number off for like ten years from diabetic, which the diabetics say means I'm diabetic! You have to laugh, for what else can you do?) - I definitely seem to have a lot of the Sjogren's signs though."

"I wonder if I can ask my gynecologist, whose easy to get in with, for an ANA? Seeing a PCP around here is silly. They look at a computer screen, don't look at you or examine you, and then whatever their verdict is left with the front desk, who can't give you what they said there but have to call you about it later! And 90% of the time, they say, ""The doctor recommends you try meditation and bike riding."" Really, it's pretty silly. Once in a while I get my blood labs checked, but I have to be very, hyper-assertive for a routine TSH after cancer!"

"So looking at alternatives. Eye doctor. Calling tomorrow to make an appointment, thank you."
"Thank you. Unfortunately to see a specialist, like a Rheumatologist, I first need to see that Dr. in person to get a referral to another doctor, even if I offer to pay out of pocket. It's very difficult as a system."

"I am starting with the opthalmologist; I know I have dry eyes. Really dry eyes. Maybe that doctor will suggest to my Dr. to refer me to someone? Maybe he can even order blood labs? Unsure, but it's all part of one big sort of hospital."
"Make sure to ask specifically if the have the test called ""Sjō"". The eye doctor can't do the other tests, and not all of them have access to the test."

"Also, there's a lot of good science and results behind intermittent fasting to stave off type 2 Diabetes. My a1c was starting into the pre-diabetes range, and now it's backed off. I only eat during a six hour window and it's really made me feel much better overall. Fasting bg is back below 80 every morning. There's a subreddit for news and support. It's worth trying to see if you can back away from that cliff!"

Good luck!
"My sjogrens diagnosis was only made a few months ago but I've had migraines all my life. One of my triggers has always been, not drinking enough water, your post has made me wonder if my sjogrens has been around longer that the 6 years I think."
My migraines greatly improved after I had my children &  significantly improved after my menopause.
I know my comment doesn't give you any answers but I do hope your symptoms improve.
I was getting them whenever my salvitory glands got too inflamed. A hot compress and massage tend to alleviate the swelling and the vertigo will go away. I rarely get it anymore.
My dry eyes themselves cause very bad headaches which can be nauseating. Sometimes you may not even notice how dry your eyes are. I went for years thinking mine were sinus headaches before I was diagnosed.
"Of course staying very hydrated helps. Also humidifiers, cold and/or warm type treatments for eyes.  Different internal and external medicines, drops, etc."

I read recently where the shape of the eye can contribute to migraines (or something like that). It made me think that the inflammation that comes with sjorgrens could be the cause for many headaches.
"Yep, I have severe migraine plus vertigo. To be honest I haven’t yet found anything that would help with migraine. Curcumin tablets ease the flares a bit but that’s all. I would love to hear if anyone knows anything that could help."
Right now I am on 600 mg of gabapentin for it. This seems to have been the best change for me.
"I think you may benefit from keeping a diary, as migraines can be food related. I have also found dehydration can trigger migraines. Forcing on your eyesight plays a role as well."

"I have had migraines for 14 years, and have taken many drugs as an attempt to help. I used to see a neurologist frequently, until he decided to wean me off the drugs as I was pretty young at the time. I've been treating my migraines ""naturally"" ever since. I also get vertigo, but it doesn't always occur along with migraines."

"Laying in the dark, away from sensorial stimuli helps a lot, as well as using cold packs/ice cubes in a towel on my forehead. Mint tea is great for nausea. Relieving neck tension is also necessary (I bought a massage device and hot packs for my neck, and I'm seeing improvement)."

I hope it helps :)

"How do you tolerate Gabapentin? I was prescribed this drug for neuropathy/CTS-like symptoms, and I was never able to take it for long :("
I am tolerating it well! I wish the weight gain wasn't a side effect so I am having to fight that.
Previous thread on topic of saliva meds but not beta blockers: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/935w0t/meds_to_increased_saliva/
"I pose a totally untested theory that our inability to use moisture on our body affects our muscles, nerves, bones, etc., making us the hot mess of pain we are. I’ve had my diagnosis for 11 years or so. I ache constantly. My muscles are so tight, pt can’t get them to stay loose, particularly in my neck and upper back, due to a fall 20 years ago. Don’t I sounds 70? I’m 55."
So sorry to hear about your pain and suffering. =(

"I still find it incredibly strange that we all have Sjogrens and yet experience so many vastly different symptoms. Mine isn't as severe as many, though I do have bad periods. Regarding bone pain, I know nothing of the mechanism but I can offer that it's something I've felt in mostly my right and left fibulas. It feels like it's broken but I can walk on it with a bit of pain. It stays with me for days or weeks at a time and then, just like it showed up, mysteriously disappears. It can be so frustrating and disheartening knowing that good days are just temporary and that something is looming over the horizon. Keep up the good fight, and I hope someone else offers more insight than what I have to offer."
"I have a lot of what feels like bone pain too, but I also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS), which is often a comorbid condition with Sjogren's. I don't know which condition causes my symptoms. If you have hypermobile joints,  you might consider being evaluated for EDS."
I have dislocations and subluxations daily.  Unfortunately every doctor I've seen in Georgia just passes the buck saying they don't diagnose EDS.  Ugh.
"I feel your pain. I'm in Georgia too and have gone through *soooo* many doctors. It's incredibly hard to find a good one. There's a Facebook Georgia EDS group I'm part of that I could introduce you to, if you'd like. They keep a list of doctors that other EDSers recommend. If you're having dislocations/subluxations daily, it really sounds like EDS to me (of course, I'm no doctor)."
"Please, I'd appreciate any help!"
My blood work came back negative but I was still diagnosed with Sjogrens.  Thought I read up to 70% of SJO patients test negative so don't put much weight in the test.
"The short answers are yes, no, and it was covered by my insurance."

"The Sjo test runs 4 standard blood tests (ANA, RF, anti-SSA/B) as well as 3 additional ones that a study showed to correlate with SS. Many doctors don't put a lot of stock into the additional tests due to a lack of data. That said, it can't hurt to get the test if you were planning to have the standard blood work done anyway."

"I have always been seronegative. I've seen estimates ranging from 20-40&#37; of SS patients being seronegative. I believe that this is low, as many seronegative patients are never properly diagnosed. That said, there aren't a lot of differential diagnoses for dry eye and mouth, and SS tends to manifest with other autoimmune diseases like celiac disease. I'm not a medical professional, but your description certainly sounds like SS."

"What do your doctors think? Have you seen a rheumatologist? A good rheumatologist won't immediately dismiss your concerns due to negative blood work. If one does, it's time to find a new doctor."
"It was just routine bloodwork that my insurance covered. I have had a big fat positive result many times now for SSB. I also have dry eyes, dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, etc. And they put this all together to diagnose me."
Thanks for your reply.  My optometrist thinks it is likely Sjogrens or another auto-immune disease like Lupus.  I found a really good optometrist who also has Sjogrens and Lupus so she knows autoimmune disease and says my dry eye fits with that.

My mom has rheumatoid arthritis so I'm going to see her rheumatologist since he will know the family history.

Do you remember what the amount billed to your insurance for the test was?  Deductibles are a pain. ;)
"I understand the insurance issues. During the year of my diagnosis, I hit my out of pocket maximum due to all of the tests I had done and specialists that I saw. Unfortunately it was several years ago and I no longer have the EOB for the test. I seem to recall that it was over $500. The price may have fluctuated since then. I would call your insurance company and make sure it is covered ahead of time."

It sounds like you're on the right track. A rheumatologist is the logical next step. Good luck with your diagnosis and treatment. I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.
"It is possible, but other things are, too. There are two things stacked against you getting a Sjogren's diagnosis. First, males make up only up to 10% of Sjogren's patients. Second, you are super young."

"Because of the first, doctors will be very likely to just ignore your suggestion of Sjogren's-other diseases share dry eyes/mouth as a symptom."

"Because of the a second, even if they take you seriously, you aren't likely to turn up positive on blood work for a while. I started showing symptoms at 17, didn't get my diagnosis until I was 39."

"That said, it does seem like you have something going on autoimmune-wise."
"Sounds like a serious possibility, you should get your blood tested and rule out other things."
"You mentioned drinking a lot of water... Are you thirsty or are you doing this because your mouth is dry? Those two things are extremely different. I have Sjögren's and type 1 diabetes. While Sjögren's Syndrome causes a dry mouth, I don't feel thirsty."

"If it is thirst, especially with a lot of urination, get your blood sugar checked. It can cause fatigue, too."
"I agree, this does seem possible."
[deleted]
"Thanks for your response! Did not know that. Literally googled dry mouth dry eyes and every link just popped up about sjogrenns. Also I have no muscular pain or anything so probably not this, but i'll keep an eye on this in the future."

"> That said, it does seem like you have something going on autoimmune-wise"

"Could you elaborate maybe? Anything you know what looks like it? In the end its basically chronic dry eyes, dry mouth and in daytime a 1-2 hour fatigue (fine for the rest). May it just be simple diabetus or something else causing dry mouth etc? (Always thought I might had it, but I didnt tick all the boxes so I never got tested)."
"Thats not the same as blood pressure is it? Because that was normal last visit. The dry mouth thing is just something I realised 5 weeks ago because somebody said it to me (how absurd I drank, but waived it away because of smoking), so I never asked about that. But planned an appointment for now with dentist for dry mouth, will check how I can do a blood test at the doc?"

"Yes very thirsty and pee a lot so, readng the comments probably not sjogrens haha. Thx anyway!"
"I was showing positive on ANA for 5 years, my Dr never mentioned it. I asked her about it, she said, ""it's usually a false positive!"""

"One month later, and with a new doctor, a diagnosis! Go figure. :)"

Doctors are not great at Sjogren's.
"No, it's not the same as blood pressure. They only need a drop of blood and it can be done with a finger poke. Results in a few seconds."

"Other symptoms of elevated blood sugar or type 1 diabetes include blurry vision, weight loss, stomach pain, fruity smelling breath. But oh, the unquenchable thirst is incredible."

Best of luck!
"IMO, for cardio swimming and biking are great, because they're both easy on the joints. With Sjogren's I recommend avoiding focusing on specific muscle groups - like doing a bunch of chest exercises - because this tends to provoke a lot of inflammation that the body cannot manage well."
Have you tried ketogenic diet or zero carb diet?

"I used to have pretty much the same issues as you. Had no energy at times to do nothing or allmost nothing. Overdoing it was an issue, would lead to months of basicly sedentary lifestyle cause of tiredness. I went first with keto which helped a lot and was on it for like 6-7 years. Made switch to zero carb late last summer. Zeroing has been the best decision I've ever done. Helped in everything and huge difference to keto and even if keto is way better than the normal diet there is no comparison to zeroing."

"Wow, that's something I hadn't really considered-- thanks for the input. It seems pretty obvious now that I think about it, but I tend to experience less exhaustion and pain when I do an ""overall"" workout day than ""leg day""/""chest day"" etc., like you're saying. I think sometimes I feel like I'm not doing ""enough"" on those days, but maybe that's what my body needs. I appreciate your response!"
"I've been thinking about changing up my diet, and keto seems to be a good way to go for me. I have some food allergies that make dieting difficult, but keto has always been something I've felt I could probably make work. I appreciate the input! Thanks for the suggestion"
Thanks! I hadn't considered compression socks at all. Thanks for the advice!
"You're very welcome, those of us with Sjogren's have got to look out for each other!"

"I used to do a lot of weightlifting, and Sjogren's definitely changed that. I know exactly what you're saying about ""overall"" workout days versus leg days or chest days."

"If you're looking for sports or activities that are good for Sjogren's, I would look into rock climbing. It is a full body workout, and the intensity is completely dictated by you. It also involves a lot of stretching which is good for keeping the body flexible and nimble."

"Yoga is good too, but it's either too boring for me or too expensive."
[deleted]
"To be honest I'm pretty afraid of heights, so I'd never really considered rock climbing-- but that makes some sense, so I am definitely gonna look into it. Could be a good opportunity to overcome some of my fears, too!"

"I enjoy yoga, though I get what you're saying on both points. On the cost front, I've had a lot of luck with donation-based studios (however, I live in a small town, YMMV). It can be tricky with crowded classes in the evenings, and limited offerings. I find that Hatha/Vinyasa or other gentle yoga classes don't stress my body too much and provide some much-needed meditative time for me, though I imagine that wouldn't be appealing if it's boring to you. :-) Sometimes I definitely find myself waiting out the clock in there"
"It's definitely a balancing act! If you don't work out at all, you feel worse. If you work out too much, you feel much worse. It's all about finding that perfect ""Goldilocks"" level of activity. *sigh*, c'est la vie!"
"Totally, I was afraid of heights when I started rock climbing, too. It is a great way to overcome that fear, but if you don't want to push yourself that way, you can also just boulder - it is great fun in itself."

"I'll have to check into yoga classes available in my local community. I hadn't considered donation-based studios - I will definitely check if any are in my area, thank you :)"
Yeah! I think I'll give it a shot; I've been looking around today and found some local groups that I think can at least work for trying it out.

"As far as donation-based yoga studios go, I'd also caution to make sure that anyone teaching in those environments is well-qualified. At least where I'm at, the instructors at our donation-based studio tend to work on a volunteer basis and are newer to the practice of teaching yoga. Luckily, the owner of this particular studio regulates it well and I feel comfortable with every instructor I've encountered there over the past 5-6 years. However, I've visited other donation-based studios while traveling where I didn't feel as confident that an instructor was prepared to teach. Again, YMMV. Good luck!"
Thanks! I will be sure to find instructors that know what they're doing. I can see how only ever having novice teachers would really sour the experience.
"Preservatives in eye drops can damage eyes if used long-term or in high volume, so it's important to use preservative-free when possible. I like Refresh individual vials (available in 100 packs at Costco!) and TheraTears bottle during the day. I also like Refresh gel drops at night. If those don't sufficiently help, you can ask your eye doctor about prescription Restasis and/or Xildra."

"If all of that doesn't work, you may also want to inquire about punctal plugs. I got top and bottom done on both eyes and it's make a world of difference."

"Another thing is the prescription I take for saliva production, Evoxac, also helps me with tear production but I don't know how common that is as a side effect."
"Hi! Plugs are a great help. I have lower plugs and also use preservative free eye drops throughout the day, Target brand, nothing fancy. At night I use the oil ointment sometimes.  They still bother me but it's manageable. Also a high quality fish oil such as Barlean's will make a huge difference.  I take a ton. Good luck!"
Thank You!

I don't know if I have Sjogrens but I have had dry eyes and dry mouth problems for 5 months now.  I was told medication to promote saliva causes really bad side effects.  Also I was told you can see the plugs in your eyes.  I can't think what else this problem would be if it isn't Sjogrens.  My blood tests (I've had several) show nothing.
"The only side effect I've heard of for saliva production med was it caused excess sweating. Comments regarding that have usually been regarding Salagen, not Evoxac. I can't see any of the 4 plugs in my eyes and haven't heard of anyone who's experienced that has (I've been an active member of SjogrensWorld.org for more than 2 years)."

"If OTC eye drops are not sufficient, you can get help for dry eyes from the eye doctor without a Sjogren's diagnosis. There are also OTC dry mouth products available at drugstore and online."

"Have you and doctor ruled out dryness from side effects of other meds or diabetes? Also, some seronegative people get lip biopsy to determine Sjogren's diagnosis, but that comes with some risks."
You absolutely cannot see the plugs in your eyes. You would need a magnifying glass to see them. They help tremendously with dry eye and are one of the solutions out there. Been using them for a decade.
"Thank you for your reply.  Yes they have ruled out other meds.  I was on propecia for a while but stopped 5 months ago.  I am worried this has triggered Sjogrens.  I will talk to my doctor but I've had multiple blood tests that reveal nothing.  I do get GERD Silent reflux like symptoms but have been told by Muliple GPs they doesn't believe I have this.  It started with me producing too much saliva, then quickly to this.  It's causing me big problems."

If Exovac can help my eyes and mouth that would be a godsend.
It means a lot to me that you took the time to reply.
I got told they fall out?  Now it's just my mouth:(  Any ideas?  Thank you very much.
"My doctor says he can  see one of my plugs. If I look *really* closely I can see a bump that may or may not be the plug. No one else has ever noticed it, so please don't be worried about that =)"
"I've found I don't tolerate many of the generic forms of Plaquenil due to the inactive ingredients that name brand Plaquenil doesn't have. There is a website called dailymed.com and it is a good resource to find ingredients to all meds. There is a generic by Prasco that has all the same ingredients as plaquenil, just have to get your pharmacy to order from that specific distributior. Hope that made sense, and you find it helpful!"
[deleted]
"Thanks, /u/StonerSpoonie. I appreciate your help. I will try to see if Cigna will let me get that."
"Headaches can really mess with your ability to function. I hope you can find a better solution. I'm encouraged that there is at least research into Sjogren's. I feel a sense of progress coming off my rheumatologist, she's on top of the cutting edge stuff and feels like there are promising developments."
Ditto what they said. My immunologist said many of her Sjogren’s patients don’t tolerate one of the main manufacturers of Plaquenil because of the inactive ingredients. Dailymed is my bible now to look up ingredients 😂
"Oh, wow, immunologists deal with Sjogren's too? I have an appointment in a couple of weeks with one to talk about mast cell activation syndrome. The list of symptoms is nearly identical to Sjogren's symptoms (and probably a 100 others). But all these crazy food allergies, I have to keep trying to figure out what's going on."
Here's a list of tests your eye doctor can do to assess dryness. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964175/

"Like /u/myintellectisbored, my ophthalmologist did some tests and informed my rheumatologist of the results which helped support and expedite my diagnosis."
"Nope.  My chronic eye problems were never diagnosed by probably close to 10 different eye doctors of various backgrounds, specialties, and experience levels.  I never heard of Sjogren's until I found it in a random reddit thread and had my endocrinologist, of all people, test me for it."
...could just be basic hyperventilation?
"Sjogren's can present with intense bouts of lethargy, but lethargy can also present on its own which is what it sounds like you might have. Lethargy in and of itself is often caused by a poor diet or a lack of hydration. I would suggest drinking a lot more water than you have been recently and see if your symptoms improve."
"Sure, but it's been going on for a few weeks and it keeps getting worse. Never had issues with hyperventilation before. No anxiety attacks or anything like that. Do you have any experience with this type of thing?"
"The problem is that the yawning is completely disconnected from my fatigue levels. I can be wide awake and energetic, and still be unable to stop these ridiculous yawning sessions =/"
"It doesn't sound like any of my symptoms, no, but my Sjogren's seems to be more mild than other posters I see here.  I may not be the best person to ask."
When presenting with constant yawning it can still be a sign of fatigue. People who are wide awake but still suffer from fatigue have been known to have yawning sessions.
Okay. Thanks for letting me know = )
Thank you! I hope that's all it is.
I had negative biopsy and labs and my rheum put me on plaquenil. She doesn’t think I have sjogrens but possible an unidentified autoimmune disease. My symptoms are bad enough that it is worth trying. I have small fiber neuropathy and pots and fear if I don’t do something to address the root cause it will get worse.

If the plaquenil doesn’t work after like 6 months then I’ll stop taking it. I’ve been on it a month with almost no side effects.
[deleted]
"Seronegative Sjogren's Syndrome is quite common; estimates place seronegative patients anywhere from a quarter to a third of all SS patients. Seronegative patients can certainly benefit from Plaquenil; I have always been seronegative (lip biopsy abnormal but not high enough to be positive), but I have had two rheumatologists prescribe Plaquenil, and I do find it beneficial for joint pain and fatigue. Keep in mind that it is much less beneficial for dryness, if that is your primary symptom."

"Plaquenil side effects are relatively minor in the short term; though the risk of permanent eye damage, while rare, does increase as the years pass. Compared to other systemic treatments (chemo drugs, biologics, etc.), Plaquenil is on the mild side. If you suffer from fatigue and/or joint pain, I'd recommend a 6-month trial to see if it helps your symptoms."
"You sound similar to me. I'm investigating small fiber neuropathy. My hands have been numb since 2010,  pain manifested in both of my arms 24/7... Sometimes it goes into my legs. I don't have inflammation in my body and all of my autoimmune tests are negative accept my compliment levels have tested low.  Let me know how Plaquenil works with you. I'm so curious.  Did you get a biopsy for small fiber neuropathy or just Sjogren's?  I would look into MS but the dry eye thing is very specific to Sjogren's...."

I agree with your rheumatologist that it's naive to think that we've identified all of the autoimmune diseases out there!  Tip of the iceberg.
"Thanks, I figured. Yeah I don't have pronounced symptoms directly related to lupus etc.  I don't have inflammation in my liver or anything, if anything my liver enzymes are low."
"That's good to know that even if your lip biopsy is abnormal your rheumatologists take you seriously. I have extreme joint pain. I don't even like wearing a bra!  Dryness is a nuisance but I'm mostly irritated by the pain.  I have the symptoms of small fiber neuropathy which I know Plaquenil wouldn't help, but I also have stiffness.  If it comes back abnormal I'm definitely doing a six-month trial.  My c3 c4 came back out of range low once which is strange"

Also I have hypermobile ehlers-danlos syndrome but that would not make my complement levels low or cause my terrible neuropathy flares. It's not a disease. I have multiple things going on.  It's really overwhelming. I'm in extreme pain when I'm not doing literally anything. Not moving.
"i had a SFN biopsy (foot and leg) as well as Sjorgrens lip biopsy.  SFN was positive, and autonomic testing showed neuropathy as well."

"I don't have dry eyes or dry mouth.  The neuropathy is manifested as autonomic symptoms (POTS, orthostatic hypotension) and a burning and prickling sensation that started in my feet and has spread to most of my body at times."

"I was nervous about Plaquenil as well, but I went to an opthamologist who is 80y/o and has had a lifetime of experience with patients taking plaquenil and he said that the risk was very minimal.  And of course as long as you get eye tested regularly you are relatively safe.  I am willing to try anything at this point, even higher risk options if necessary, as the disease is affecting my life greatly."
"Hey, so I have a reminder here to update you on my Plaquenil process.  I stopped Plaquenil about 3 months ago.  I felt that it was not helping me.  Turns out I also had B6 toxicity from taking too much supplement.  I have been getting worse since then.  I think this is a result of B6 toxicity.  My rheumatologist said that it was very unlikely that I had autoimmune issues, since the plaquenil was not helping me after several months."

"To clarify, my original symtoms (the reason I went on Plaquenil in the 1st place) were not due to B6 toxicity.  I only started taking B6 once I was on Plaquenil."
"RemindMe! 5 Months ""update u/Fadedwaif on my Plaquenil success or failure"""
"I had a qsart test for small fiber neuropathy but I guess that's not a good test. Especially compared to a biopsy... I didn't feel pain or anything, it was just like whatever. That's interesting your eyes aren't dry. Do you get waves of pins? I get them And a couple of times they've actually started around my stomach... And after the wave my fingertips will be more numb. I have the glove distribution 24/7  Also it'll feel like I have sciatica. I have dysautonomia flares as well where I feel like I'm choking, can't breathe and I'm going to pass out.  None of the treatments for small fiber neuropathy sound any good to me which sucks.  But Plaquenil sounds nice for the stiff feeling. I do have a stiff feeling all over.  I take hot baths constantly to try to get rid of it."

Another quirky thing about me is I have insulin resistance despite being painfully thin.

Good luck I hope Plaquenil works for you

"QSart is good but it's not as definitive as a biopsy.  I think the main reason for a more definitive test is for insurance approving  certain drugs like IVIG.  The biopsy isn't bad if you ever think of getting it, the worst part is the numbing injections and the anticipation.  No pain afterwards, and three small scars which fade over time."

"I don't think I have Sjogrens but I'm still subscribed to this sub because I'm on Plaquenil, and I deal with many of the same issues the Sjogren's people suffer from.  The pins are in waves, and sometimes in random spots for a second.  I guess I have more than one kind of prickly sensation too. They come when I'm feeling worse in general and go when I'm better, and seem to be affected by blood flow like after exercising or taking a hot bath."

Yeah small fiber neuropathy treatments are limited.  I am hoping that I can at least stop the progression.  And exercising can help regrow nerves so I am trying to do as much as possible but that takes time.  Exercise is also the #1 thing that makes me feel better.  IVIG can help too though that is hard to get insurance to pay for.  My rheumatologist mentioned it as an option if Plaquenil doesn't work.

Thanks and good luck to you too!
"Does heat make you feel better?  I'm addicted to hot baths, and I used to put my hands over a steamer because I noticed when my hands were veiny they felt better.  I also paid tons of money for physical therapy which helped also.... My physical therapist thought I had complex regional pain syndrome which doesn't really describe me.... But I'm glad she took my pain seriously"

"As a side note, my hands were numb and then 6 months later they randomly regained sensation. And at the time they regained sensation it was hot and I was exercising a lot... I could see all the veins in my hands bulging. I don't tell this to people because I know it sounds crazy. But then one day they went numb again."

IVIG therapy is the only decent sounding treatment. $$$$ And it sounds like it might have a lot of side effects. I have normal IGG levels too... But I think most of us do.

"Good to know about the biopsy. I don't care about pain at all, just seeing blood!  I figure anyone in as much pain as we are can probably handle a biopsy :)"
"I love hot baths too, although I can only tolerate a certain amount of time in the bath before I start to get light headed and I have to be careful about the temperature.  Heat takes away the achey pain and lifts my fatigue a bit.  I try and take them before bed because they help me sleep better.  Showers are good too but I can't spend as much time in them due to standing up."

I wonder if they are helpful or harmful in the long run though.  I'm not really sure.  As a temporary measure they are such a relief.

"Yeah you know in terms of pain relief I was thinking, I've taken hydrocodone, smoked cbd etc.  Dont feel much different but a bath helps the most, no joke.  I get dizzy too from pots. The dumbest thing I do and I continue to do it is to drink tea/coffee then take a hot bath.  Recipe for fainting!  Lol"
"If you aren't sure about Sjorgren's, you should get to a doctor first."

"This sounds especially bad for sjorgren's-related tooth problems, you may have something else going on."
"I have sjodgrens and I am pregnant.  I currently do not take the medication (plaquenil) every day, as I didn't want it to affect the baby."

"My doctor told me that it wouldn't harm the baby or baby's development at all, but my symptoms aren't bad enough for me to take the drug in the first place."

Just be straight forward with the doctor. Tell them your concerns and your hopes and all of the symptoms you have been having or have had.  I'm afraid that I don't have specific questions because everyone is different.

My first appointment was an hour because he asked me everything under the sun that I didn't tell him.  He is extremely attentive and made me feel like I was the most important person in the hour that I had him.  I can call him at anytime if I have questions or need an earlier appointment.

"In regards to the baby.  Sjogdrens can cause a super super small percentage of baby's to be born with a heart defect.  I'm considered high risk because of it and from week 16-week 26, I get to hear the heartbeat once a week to see if the heart is beating as it should.  It's kind of scary but you need to let the anxiety go because there isn't anything you can do.  If they do hear a problem they will put in a pacemaker (insane as that sounds).  We are week 22 and baby is perfect and the bonus is that we get to hear their heartbeat every week."
It's wonderful to hear your baby is doing well! You must be very excited!

I hope our doctor is as attentive as yours.
What industry?  There may be a job in that field that you can take for the health insurance until you're established enough to get a decent salary.

"When I used the Marketplace last year, my options were significantly cheaper than 400-500.  I was paying $350/mo for the $0 deductible plan, which was the most expensive listed. This is obviously going to vary a lot by region, but it's worth taking a look.  You might be surprised."

"No, you cannot currently be denied coverage for your disease.  If Obamacare is repealed, which was very much being considered earlier this year,  that may not be the case, but the story on pre-existing conditions seemed to change every single day.  I also don't believe they can currently charge you a higher price."

"I have not been diagnosed long enough to deal with insurance regarding Sjogren's, but I can tell you some fucking horror stories in regards to my diabetes.  Advice:  do *all* your own research, know which drugs and generics are on your insurance's preferred list and which tier it's on because your doctor will absolutely prescribe the one you can't afford, and document *everything*.  I'm currently in the habit of checking my online bank statement, my online insurance claims website, my HSA account balance, my prescription meds site for shipment dates, and I periodically check if  copay prices have changed on anything *every day*, and they still slip stuff past me. (And before I scare you too much, Sjogren's management doesn't appear to have anywhere near as much involvement as diabetes management, so this all is probably way overkill for your situation.)"

"And story time:  I was also young and invincible, and so I didn't get health insurance.  Within two months I was in the hospital for a week in the ICU because apparently my pancreas stopped working.  Don't risk it. I cashed in every bit of karma I was ever owed and got my hospital bill forgiven, but the sticker price was high enough that I'd have never paid it off.  You do not want to risk it."
"I get a super weird feeling in my body, like I am about to have a fever, or I feel really weak. Also usually starts with a swollen lymph node and waking up with joint pain."
"In my experience, the best indicator is right when you wake up.  Do your toes hurt?  Bottoms of your feet and palms of your hands on Fire?  Does it hurt to bend your fingers?  Do your legs ache, bone pain?  I literally sleep with ice packs on my head.  The constant feeling of having a fever, even when you don't, is helped with an ice pack on the back of the neck.  Works great for the migraines.  Anyway. I basically do an assessment of my body and you can generally tell when things are heading towards a flare.  That helps a lot in knowing how much I can do that day.  Now if we could just figure out how to make others understand and realize how debilitating and FRUSTRASTING this illness is."
I k owyou I'm starting to flare by swelling in my hands in the morning when I wake up.  Starts getting progressively worse over a few days with my eyes starting to feel like they have sandpaper for eye lids. Also get very foggy and just tired. Also have certain muscles which get very painful and tight (particularly in right hip but also knee) I can also easily gain 10lbs. I am usually about 145 and fairly muscular so 10lbs is a LOT. I have to have clothes to fit during those times because my work pants turn into leggings.
"My sjogrens flare starts when intestine gets stuck in an abdominal wall or pelvic muscle pockets, and then food passes through it. I have to exhale out until i cant anymore and arch my back hard while pushing my stomach up. then i can feel the intestine pop out between the muscle (usually at the bottom of my far right bottom of ribcage, four inches below belly button, or far left under ribcage. Once the intestine is free from the muscle pocket, the sjogrens goes away temporarily.  My rheumatologist diagnosed me in 2016 when i had super dry tongue eyes, burning skin,  and bone dry mouth. Along with fatigue and joint pain."
Thanks. I am recently diagnosed and trying to figure it all out!
Jeez that sounds horribly painful! I hope you don't experience this often!
"I saw your post about curing your Sjogren's on another page; my guess is that you got Sjogren's from your hernia causing the iron deficiency, which increases something called MMP9, which causes Sjogren's.  Various things can cause an increase in MMP9 though, so unless someone is also suffering from Iron Deficiency via hernia/choked intestines they probably won't benefit from your cure. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20674992"
"I was diagnosed with Sjogrens only yesterday and was told it could affect the organs,  I'm so sorry you have that happen,  you're the first person I have read about having this type of symptom and pain.  Your comments helped me.  Thank you."
How are you feeling now? What prompted you to go in? Do you have other questions? I have had this for a long time and am happy to help. :)
"Mine had ALOT to do with how the intestines were configurated, i had 2 sections of small intestine stuck between two side abdominal muscle strings, but once i pushed it loose, the sjogrens foot blistering symptoms went away. I had pushed stuck intestine free right under my center rib cage, and that relieved the skogrens burning eyes and tongue. It seemed like intestine was stuck in tissue under my stomach"
"Thank you! I am exhausted most of the time. I had severe insomnia for about six years - sometimes only sleeping 16 hours in two weeks. Last year I finally started figuring out how to treat my insomnia. By May things were mostly under control...and then I started feeling fatigued, severely fatigued like I had the flu even after sleeping 10 hours. I was barely making it through the day. I tested positive for the Sjogrens antibody August 15, 2017 and started Plaquenil. I also just got a rx for modafanil but I haven't started it yet. I really hope it works. The fatigue, difficulty concentrating, headaches, and brain fog are the worst symptoms for me but I do also have pain. So far, I seem to have been in a continuous ""flare""..."
Wow that is absolutely amazing. I can't imagine the pain that caused you. I hope you feel at least a little better after that
"I understand. I also deal with the fatigue, and currently my worst symptom is severe joint pain. I remember periods where I was actually running a fever from the sjogrens flare up--it makes you feel like you have the flu, but you're not contagious, so ur is kind of hard to explain to work and friends and family. Now, I also have crowns on all my teeth. Are you experiencing dry mouth and dry eye?"
I don't actually have a fever but I feel like I do...and positive on the dry mouth. I consequently drink tons of water and have to pee all of the time. I worry about my teeth because I also have TMJ so going to the dentist is horrible for me. People really don't understand the fatigue....which affects my mood in addition to the general depression of having to deal with all of this. Do you work? How do you manage your low energy?
"I do work full time, 40-50 hours per week. I don't start til 830 which really helps me get rest, but on my early days, I am a wreck, and all my coworkers know it and help me out. I go to bed at 930 every night, because I have to. My biggest fear is not being able to work when I am older--I am only 27 now, and I Don't know what I would do."

I am curretnly on Imuran and prednisone. Are you on anything besides plaquenil? It helps some people but I think it is kind of crap for people with severe sjogrens. Have you ever tried prednisone for flareups?
"Sorry, yesterday got a little crazy for me. I also work. I start at 8 two days a week, 8:30 two days a week and 9 one day a week. It definitely makes a difference to start later! I also fear not being able to work or accomplish my goals...but you are very young to be dealing with this - my heart goes out to you."

I haven't tried anything besides plaquenil as I was just diagnosed about two weeks ago. I have also just been prescribed Provigil for the fatigue. I hope that works because in addition to working I just started a training program to further my expertise. Stress definitely makes my symptoms worse as I don't sleep as well and everything sort of cascades from there...

Where do you live? Thank you so much for sharing!
Nope. Nope. Nope.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
If you have primary Sjogren's do not do it.
I've had two different eye surgeries but they weren't to correct my vision. One was for recurrent corneal erosion (they scraped off both corneas to let them grow back) and the other was for a detached retina in one eye. I didn't complain about dry eyes until after the first surgery (corneal erosion). Then the surgery for my retina somehow made that eye even more dry. I have no clue how those surgeries made it worse but they did.

I say listen to your ophthalmologist. You may not have permanent problems but do you really want to take that risk given the nature of SS?
I had it before I knew I had sjogren's. It has caused me countless issues.
Personal experience you can share?
If your lasik person is willing to give you it knowing you have Sjogren's that person is not a very skilled health professional.

I keep a bottle of water with me at all times. I keep 2 small bottles in my purse in case I forget to bring one. I also keep 2 large water bottles in my back pack at all times. I don't need an app to remind me to drink the water I just do. Keep bottles of water with you and you will be fine.

"-artificial tears. genTEAL makes a gel and drops, and other brands make gel-drops. it will help IMMENSELY!"
"-go to the dentist. i go 4 times per year because my dentist took pity on my teeth and gives me two extra free cleanings, but she really needs to stay on top of her dental hygiene. a prescription fluoride toothpaste will help a lot, as will mouth washes and drops to help keep the mouth moist. I use the biotene mouth wash."

"does she have any intestinal problems or joint pain? i find that when i am over tired, my joints hurt just as badly as my moms do when she is in a flare up (she has RA)"

"edit: I also got magic mouthwash from my doctor to help with mouth sores, as well as 'numoisten' drops for dry mouth."

"there is also a prescription called ""evoxac"" that helps you have more spit and more tears. I usually only use it in a flare up because it makes me kind of sweaty."
"That is a really broad question.  Are there specific areas she needs help with. As to general advice I'd suggest drinking as much water as possible, sleeping as much as possible and taking care of herself in general."
"Fortunately, she works for an eye hospital so we have access to a lot of eye drops.  She does prefer genTEAL, I believe.  She hasn't been going to the dentist as much as she probably should, but she does use a good toothpaste and biotene. I will look into the numoisten drops.  Her rheumatologist suggested exovac when her dryness worsens.  She does have horrible joint pain.  Sometimes to the point where she has to lay down for a bit.  Her flare ups seem to coincide with her stress level, but that is just an observation that I have made.  Thank you for your input, its greatly appreciated."
"Yes, its supposed to be broad because I am looking for things that I can do to help her in her everyday life that are particular to people living with loved ones that are afflicted with Sjogren's.  I don't want to coddle, but I would like to be of assistance as she is determined to take on tasks that she later regrets due to pain.  Any particular foods that I could prepare that may help, any products I could buy to help with salivation, etc..."
"As you get to know her disease you will probably find her flairs are a direct result of stress.  The dentist is very, very important.  It should be a high priority."
"One suggestion that doodlebug said is let her determine where she needs help. Being diagnosed with a major life changing illness is difficult. I insisted on doing things that I would pay for later because I didn't want to admit defeat. It felt as if I was giving up if I allowed others to do""my"" responsibilities."
"Research, learn and be there for her. My SO does not fuss at me much anymore on my overdo days because he understands my emotional struggle with SS. Communicate your willingness to be there and let her come to you.  Soft hugs to her and blessings to you both."
For as broad as you're looking for I'd suggest getting a book on Sjogren's.  I suggested narrowing it down because it would take hours to write everything down.

Also things vary greatly person to person. How severe is her SS? Can she work? Is she struggling with constant pain?

How to help daily? Maybe help her plan things so she's using her energy efficiently.  For instance multiple trips up and down stairs on a bad day are very wearing. Be willing to revisit the household chores division regularly. Have back up plans in place for her bad days.  Perhaps she has certain responsibilities on good days and others or less on bad days.

As far as food goes I'd buy the best food you can afford and lean towards whole foods because eating prepared foods is tempting when your tired.  Since I don't have someone to take care of me I prepare food in advance so when I'm sick I have easy stuff like homemade oatmeal packets. If she has a really dry mouth you want to avoid very dry or crunchy things. Spicey food may be an issue as well. Heartburn can also be a problem so highly acidic food could cause more heartburn.

"Above all, of course, it doesn't matter what the drs, books or strangers on the internet say she needs to tell you what she needs help with. That's all I have time for atm but I can come back later tonight and write more.  I know you are looking for all the information, but asking more specific things would help me, and others, help you and your gf better."
"Thank you very much for the input.  I want to help because I see the after effect of her ""overdoing it,"" but I have to let her because I don't want her to feel abnormal.  I guess I should go about life as I normally would until she asks for assistance.  We have both, lets say, upgraded our diet to organic whole foods.  She does have a hard time avoiding acidic and spicy foods as Italian and Indian are some of her favorites.  She has found a great rheumatologist that doesn't prescribe opiates.  If you don't mind me asking, what treatment are you on?  Currently, my fiancé is on a Plaquenil and Meloxicam regimen.  Its seems like every pharmaceutical used in treatment has some pretty bad side effects."
"No I don't mind. I'm currently only on Plaquenil. There are two reasons for this.  The first is that I don't have insurance or the income to deal with large medical bills so I'm not as aggressive with this as I would like to be not are there very good public health options where I live. Second is because the rhuemy I have has tried a few cheap treatments, I'm pretty sure just to shut me up, and I found that the problems and symptoms were compounded on them.  You could start a new thread to specifically ask people what they take. It may get noticed better separately."

If you feel like she's overdoing it on a regular basis perhaps you could talk to her when she isn't tired (HA!) and see if you could set up some type of accountability system. She may not be recognizing it or she may still be in denial of what her limitations are. It's really difficult to adjust.
"Let's see..first, spicy foods only need to be avoided if she has a problem with them. I cook with spices and love some fire. But it doesn't bother me."
"I am on plaquenil, nucynta (for pain), a steroid inhaler and a nebulizer because it has decided my lungs are the best thing to attack. Meds will vary for all of us based on symptoms.  I have 2 other auto immune diseases, so I have overlapping symptoms and treatments."
"First, thank you for replying.  Unfortunately, we can't have narcotic pain relievers in the house.  I'm sorry to hear that it has decided to attack your lungs.  My fiancé just got diagnosed this week with interstitial cystitis (sp?) in her bladder. So, I guess the Sjogren's has decided to go after her bladder."

Are you using Advair?  My father develops drugs for asthma and COPD and he says that Advair is one of the better inhalers on the market.  Just be sure to wash your mouth out after each inhalation as it can lead to thrush.
"Hopefully your fiancé will never need the narcotic pain meds.  I had my neck broken, have had 3 neck fusions so far.  Hopefully it will behave and I won't have to go any further up.  Plus I have high pain from SS, Hashimoto's, dysautonomia, FMS combination.  I avoided pain meds even with this until this year."
"No, I am not using Advair.  I am not asthmatic nor do I have COPD.  I just have lack of moisture which can lead to bronchitis or pneumonia over and over again.  He has me on steroid inhaler and nebulizer for moisture.  Plus the first week of each month I take antibiotics.  He was shocked that as sick as I have been that there is no damage at all in my lungs or bronchi."
"I have personally tried several inflammatory/low-carb diets, including the Autoimmune Protocol elimination diet and the Perfect Health diet. I do believe that there is a connection between diet and health, particularly for autoimmune patients. Unfortunately, the quantity and quality of studies focusing specifically on diet and autoimmune patients (outside of celiac disease and IBD) is low."

"While I've found that avoiding certain foods (wheat, sugar, dairy, etc.) does help reduce my symptoms, it has not been the magic cure that some of these diets propose to be. I'm leery of anyone advertising a diet who stands to significantly benefit financially (books, branded or pre-packaged food, etc.) in patients using it. That doesn't mean such diets can't be helpful, but any diet shouldn't require a significant amount of additional money over trips to a grocery store."

"I personally would try the AIP or another elimination diet as a way to find foods to which your body reacts poorly. I believe that everyone is different, and there is no 'one size fits all' diet solution."
Links? What is it??
"Probably to late to comment on this, but since my IBS & Sjogren's Syndrom are BFFs that diet would probably leave me in the bathroom all day. So I recommend caution when adopting a diet like that."
I hope this link worked...dr Jean Seignalet developed a diet that specifically addresses sjogrens among other diseases and claims can really help.....
Stopautoimmunity.com

"I'm skeptical of anything that involves me having to pay someone money to tell me stuff like ""eat fruits and vegetables"". All I'm seeing on her Instagram and website are ""pay me money and I'll tell you stuff"". The four week course is *five thousand dollars*. Another course is *three thousand dollars*. There is no breakdown anywhere of what the protocol is. That doesn't smack of someone who wants to help me."

"To be really blunt, I'm getting really tired of people trying to sell things to people who are suffering. I'm also really tired of the implication that us having these illnesses is our fault and everything would be cured if we just ate the latest ""superfood"", never stopped doing yoga, and shoved raw kale up our asses."

"Has anyone broken down her ""protocol"" somewhere for free? How similar is it to Autoimmune Paleo (AIP) or the Wahls Protocol or the countless others?"

"I'm not knocking all the others. I did become a fan of Sarah Ballantyne's work (""The Paleo Approach"" et al) just because she spent so much time writing big books breaking everything down with science, blogging, and writing out the protocol for free online. She's even mentioned in a few places how she still struggles with symptoms even when doing everything right and that nothing is a cure-all, it just helps."

"You just have to look at these things critically. If someone is trying to sell you a product, they're going to show you all the success stories and toot their own horn as much as they can. Always look deeper into it, realize what might be anecdotal evidence, what might be faked, etc. Just because someone is a doctor doesn't mean they are a good one."
Cool keep us updated after more time. I did a nutrient dense devengan diet years back and did not feel better. I do best on autoimmune paleo. Some are cured with simple dietary changes but most are not. Hope u continue to see progress
Also doing a Whole Foods plants-based diet and doing really well. Only one flare in several weeks and it used to everyday.
Thank you for saying everything I couldn't articulate!
"Just to clarify, her protocol is for free. So no money needed and I paid no money. That's exactly why I trust her, I paid no money because I watched her webinar which she does when time permits. Otherwise her book explains her protocol."
"Ah man I feel like you ruined it for everyone with all the people upvoting you. I understand you're feeling your pain and I am right there with you but you just wrote this whole message and closed your heart to a free message From a sincere source. Oh well, I felt an obligation to share and so I did. Take it or leave it :)"
"She's actually not asking you to pay anything. She has a protocol, she put it in a book. I just watched her three webinars that she did on her own time and stayed 3 extra hours to explain and answer questions."

"While I am skeptical just like you, she's an MD that is talking about her own experience. The only time you would pay if you wanted coaching."
"Please sign up for her webinars when they happen and see for yourself that she doesn't want your money. She explains that her protocol ( which she tells you in the book or webinar that she does every couple of months) that plants remove all inflammation and that Paleo includes meat and meat is extremely inflammatory. Take from it what you will. As she put it, ""it could be crap, but it's free crap"" when you have a huge problem like an autoimmune disease, I think it wouldn't be horrible to try a different way to approach an illness. But to each his own. I am just sharing because I know what it means to suffer as I have undiagnosed Sjogren's."
I sure will keep you updated. Thanks :)
"Thank you for responding. That's what I am doing as well, consuming a huge amount of leafy greens and omega 3s in the form of a smoothie. I felt better and lighter in general. I have yet to see the results on my overall health as it has only been a week."
"Hey, don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's working out for you."

I just didn't see anything anywhere on her Instagram or website that was free and it all seemed very sales-pitch-y. Personally that just turns me right off of things.

"I know there are other programs that are on the scammy side. I have a personal moral obligation to speak up when I come across something that might be unfair, unjust, or scammy."

"More so I just wanted to warn folks to be careful, and realize that there are tons of ""protocols"" out there that claim similar things but don't work for everyone. If this does work, awesome. If it is free, neat."

"If I were her, I would get some new folks in charge of her website and social media, though, to communicate her intentions a little better."
Is this a joke?
"So, you cured two incurable autoimmune disorders (one that targets skin and one that targets moisture secreting glands) by fixing an intestinal obstruction even though neither autoimmune disorder has anything to do with intestinal obstruction? And then you give advice on how to deal with said obstruction in a manner that could damage the intestines?"

Neither Sjogren's or psoriasis is caused by heavy lifting or straining on the toilet or sneezing too hard. They are caused by an autoimmune system choosing to attack the body. There is no cure for either of these diseases.





"While I don't doubt that you do feel better, but if that is the case, you did not have Sjogrens or psoriasis .  Be glad you do not have it, as you would not be feeling better now.  There is no known treatment to remove the antibodies that have learned to attack host tissues, and pushing intestines around would have no effect in that manner.  If you had a kink in your digestive tract, you were probably suffering from malnutrition/dehydration.  Regardless of what was causing your symptoms, I am glad you feel better.  Intestinal obstructions are no joke, and cause a variety of symptoms, which I am sure include dehydration.  Side note:  NEVER try to treat intestinal blockages yourself!  You can die very quickly from a twist, called a strangulation, because the strangulated section of intestine will turn gangrenous and kill you in a horribly painful fashion.  If you suspect intestinal blockage or twisting, go to the doctor, and do NOT poke and prod yourself."
"This is what should come up in the dictionary under ""hypochondriac."""
"I admit I'm sceptical, but I'm glad you're feeling better! Have you seen your doctor since this happened?"

You clearly have no understanding of how medicine works.
You must not have had Sjogrens.  Sjogrens is incurable.
The area i pushed upwards was
Where caecum and ileum are in the pic.

http://www.myvmc.com/uploads/VMC/Anatomy/gastro/small_intest_450.jpg

After about 10 minutes my Sjogrens symptoms went away.

Something about that area affected caused my symptoms for the past year. I had to push pretty deep in upwards motion for it to readjust.

Im suspecting some type of digestive gas or blood vessel strangulation in that area that was causing my Sjogrens.
"u/emmgoose , it's so disappointing to read so much negativity towards someone who has found relief from a severely depressing disease.        More than dissapointing, it's pathetic that all these patients haven't done the research to discover that many patients have found relief from autoimmune diseases through drastic diet changes.   Your post is another testament to the growing research that (some) autoimmune diseases are directly caused by gut and intestinal issues."
"No. i really got rid of my Sjogrens by ""pushing"" the intestinal sections back in line. I had to exhale hard and arch my back while pushing, and it moved the intestinal section back in place. The Sjogrens is gone now."
"No you dont understand. I accidentally cured my sjogrens by readjusting my intestine fromthe outside. Im telling you how to prevent the intestine from getting back out of place, which happened a couple times after fixing it (avoid lifting/sneezing too hard).  My sjogrens was caused by intestine misplacement. Yours may be caused by whatever...obviously i am not you."

I didnt tell anyone that they must do anything. I only am telling my story on how i made it go away. If you dont want to hear it Dont listen. Oh wait you already didnt listen. Then just find another post to look at.
"I agree. No regrets, however. Symptoms are gone and my life is brand new again."
It was alot less damaging than the Heimlich maneuver.
You're all being huge dicks.
This is really not a fitting way to address /u/Emmgoose. He feels he's really on to something here. The likelihood that he is mistaken doesn't mean he has hypochondriasis. Please don't throw around diagnoses you don't understand.
"You dont understand that when two doctors (pcm&optometrist) diagnosed me after positive tests/symptoms and issued prescriptions, thats not a hypochondriac. Know what the dictionary says before you make sarcastic comments."
"No need to, its gone now. I dont even need to renew my prescription now."
"I eat normal food, no vitamins now, but pushing the bottom right belly up hard with my palm removed the sjogrens symptoms that i had an entire year. I felt the intestine go back in its proper position. Started 3 days ago. I really really thought this info must be let out to the public. If its reproducible from others, then there is something ""maybe"" specific to this sjogrens.  I dont know why i went from sjogrens 100% to zero right after pushing the lower right intestine upwards! Wtf!"
Well enjoy your lifetime then. I will enjoy mine.
"Yeah, the intestines gets caught in places, tangled, or embedded in muscle tissue areas and many people dont know why they are sick for years. Every so often the intestine still gets caught in the inguinal muscle area (causing the sjogrens symptoms) and i have to do freakin yoga stretches and exhale hard to get it loose. Then the symptoms clear."
"I understand what you wrote. What you do not understand is that Sjogren's is not curable. Neither is psoriasis. And neither of them are caused by intestinal ""misplacement""."

"I am glad that whatever you did has improved your life, but don't think for one second that I will stand by and let you post inaccurate information regarding chronic and serious disorders."
"Choking to death is something you do not have time to wait for a doctor on, and the average person has been proven time and time again to be competent enough to perform the Heimlich maneuver correctly.  Simple instruction is enough to do it right, and the negative effects are nothing compared to the immediate threat of choking to death.  Besides, if you keep up on emergency medical procedures, the current standard for a conscious choke victim is back slaps to encourage coughing, or chest compressions if they are unconscious."


"The average adult has over 25 feet of intestines, and you would have NO WAY of knowing where exactly a blockage or twist is, let alone at what angle to manipulate it, or that it isn't so blocked or twisted that pushing it around would even help, if not make it much worse.  You are encouraging people to do something that could KILL them, when if they really thought they had this problem, they could go to their doctor or an ER.  That is what my grandmother did when she got a twist in her small intestine.  After days of indigestion, she did exactly what you are suggesting here.  Within minutes her indigestion turned into searing pain, and my uncle had to drive her the 30 miles to the closest ER.  The doctor had to perform surgery, and she barely survived."

"Again, glad you feel better, but the advice you are giving is dangerous, and unfounded.  What you are suggesting people try is potentially life threatening, and since Sjogren's (or in this case, most likely malnutrition/dehydration) is not choking to death, you have enough time to go to a trained doctor for an exam.  I am sorry your post didn't go as you expected, but don't encourage people to do something dangerous, then compare it to an easily learned, emergency use only medical procedure."
> He feels he's really on to something here.

And I feel the earth is actually flat. Respect my feelings please.
"You mentioned nothing about the doctor testing for ANAs.  If you really had Sjogren's, you'd most likely be sent to a rheumatologist to confirm the diagnosis, check for other AI conditions, and manage your treatment. But most obviously, if you had Sjogren's, you wouldn't be able to ""cure"" it by pressing your stomach."

"You're a cray cray who gets off on attention, first from claiming to have an illness, and then when that gets old, from claiming to cure it. Super insulting to people who actually suffer from it. Get a new hobby, maybe try knitting?"
"Three days remission may not be long enough to consider yourself cured, so stay alert to the possibility of a recurrence."

"Ok fine. Dont believe my experience. Stay in your belief that it is proven (by ??) to be permanent and that there is nobody in the entire globe that did something to make it instantly gone. Meanwhile... my eyes are now clear, skin smooth, and mouth moist. Have a good day"
There's a growing group of researchers that believe many autoimmune diseases are directly caused by gut and intestinal issues.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036413/
I didnt tell anyone to do anything.  Please read carefully. Im just sharing my experience. Your reading comprehension needs alot of work. I didnt give advice either.
"You are being political, and are making my health testimony into part of your political spin. If you want to make things into a political party, you really need to bring your poison plug elsewhere."
"I didnt get off attention. Im telling my experience. If you think im lying, and experience didnt happen, then you are so psychic that you obviously know what kind of test it was that i had, because you are God himself. I dont care if you comment or not. I just want to share."

"You are ""so"" smart that you ""know"" that my test didnt have ANAs. Which it actually DID cover. So genious of you. I Hope you feel smarter telling me to knit, while i hold a copy of my old lab test results that DID have a section covering ANA ranges."
"I feel a slightly tight in the chest, but at least im 3 days sjogrens free. Went from eyes on fire at night, cottonmouth, dry skin. Now im driving with windows down, no lotion needed, and havent touched my eye moisturizer in 3 days. It did SOMETHING."
"What I've stated has been proven by medical science from all over the world. It isn't a belief, but a fact."
"So you don't think that in any way someone might be desperate enough to copy you, especially given your detailed instruction?  There is no way whatsoever someone might mistake the detailed description of your experience to be advice is some way (sarcasam, since people might misunderstand something they read).  Your common sense needs a lot of work.  You are posting to the internet, where people believed you could charge an iPhone in the microwave, or that there was an app that turns your tablet into a weight scale if you stood on it!"

"I am sorry for being harsh here, and I tried to be calm and reasonable, but my grandmother nearly died by doing exactly what you did because she heard about it somewhere.  What about the next person who remembers some post they read online, but doesn't have a way to get to a hospital in time?  While you are probably beyond thrilled that you aren't suffering anymore, I am sure you have no intention to give medical advice, but you need to be aware of how what you are sharing can come across to people."
"Ahaha I said that you *never* mentioned it, I didn't say anything about your test not having ANAs. Maybe try reading comprehension as a hobby instead."

"Or why don't you tell your story and get featured in some medical journals? After all, you've managed to do something that doctors and scientists haven't been able to accomplish after decades of hard work! And with a 10 minute turn around time from poking your stomach, wow."
I'd sooner believe that /r/greenbeansaregood is psychic than believe you are not mentally ill in some way.
"Let's take it on faith, say, that your symptoms abated after you freed your intestinal constriction."

"I.) Could be a coincidence, two things happened at the same time that have no relationship with each other."


"A.) If so, the manipulation had no effect,  the Sjogrens being an autoimmune disease can come and go, especially early on in disease course."

"B.) Better absorption of nutrients might have created an autoimmune holiday, though I'm not sure if this is a possible effect of intestinal manipulation, especially where scarring is the issue.."

II.) The action did cause symptomatic relief.

A.)The immune system is being challenged by fresh damage you did to your intestine so is letting up on the antibody attack to healthy tissue

B.) There is a causal effect from mechanical intestinal issues we don't yet understand.

1.) A much higher than normal comorbidity  of Sjogrens disease and celiac patients. 15% of Sjogren's patients have celiac disease. CD is 1500% more likely in Sjogren's patient than the general public.

a.) Something as yet unknown about intestinal issues may trigger Sjogren's

b.) Lack of saliva and other digestive secretions cause intestinal issues that can lead to celiac disease.

"Note: It is hypothesized among celiac researchers that an initial damage in the form of physical trauma, illness or gut-irritating agents such as capsaicin, certain drugs, etc. that causes epithelial (gut lining) damage is necessary to start off the celiac disease cascade whereby leakage from the intestine through tight cellular junctions set off an inappropriate immune response. People with the genetic profile for celiac disease (those with HLA DQ2 and/ or DQ8) will not activate their potential illness unless the disease cascade is initiated. Only 80% of those with celiac genes get the disease."

"Perhaps there is just more to intestinal involvement than we yet know. Remember, autoimmune disease was considered very rare as recently as the 80s. The research on it is still in its infancy; science moves very slowly."

"Please, nobody try to manually manipulate your own intestines, especially if you have known digestive issues."

"Also, OP, if you have visually detectable intestinal scarring, please see a GI and get tested for Crohn's and celiac diseaae."

Edit: Here's a paper on the co-morbidity of Sjogren's and gluten intolerance: http://www.ifsmed.com/media/image/JournalofGlutenSensitivity_Sjogrens.pdf

"This is a bit confusing because in the past few years, gluten intolerance that isn't celiac disease is medically termed ""non-celiac gluten sensitivity,"" which is a completely separate animal from celiac disease. I'm going to go with the probability that they mean ""celiac disease"" when they say ""gluten intolerance."""

Im here to share my experience. Thats all. You haven't had one. So whine and complain on another thread.
"If someone is really gullible, they have no business on internet health forums. Natural selection will decide their fate. Again, im sharing my experience to see if someone has had the similar experience. Being an adult means being an adult and taking responsibility. If they are underage their parents need to do their job. Im not here to babysit grown ass people with 20 legal disclaimers."
"Since you want to go to threads poking, digging, and blasting people for omissions and exclusions, you have wasted my time as well as your own. Thanks."
[deleted]
"I haven't had one what? Experience? I've got 26 years of experience with Sjogren's. I don't usually post my own story, but I use my experience plus the research I have done over the years to help others here who have questions about it. I will post my own experience this time though because I think you should see it. I can't make you read it, but I hope you will."

"I've had Sjogren's since I was 17 years old, but I wasn't diagnosed until I was about 34. The first symptoms I noticed: I couldn't be in bright light without it feeling like I was being stabbed in the eyes and I started having problems talking and singing because I had no saliva. It seemed to suddenly start over night although I doubt it did. Maybe it did. I don't know. One day I'm out in the sun not having any problems; the next I'm doubled over in pain because my eyes can't take the light and buying gum and throat drops because my mouth is so dry. Eventually I had to add chronic fatigue to the list."

"I went to various doctors and no one could figure it out. My main complaint was dry, painful eyes and severe dislike of bright light. I was basically becoming a recluse, preferring nighttime to daylight and hating going anywhere that involved being in the sun. This eventually led to a severe vitamin D deficiency by the way."

It took me nearly 20 years for a diagnosis. I have copies of most of my medical records and it fills 4 3-inch binders. I had eventually gone to a rheumatologist for a second opinion regarding fibromyalgia (another disease I have). She decided to run some tests because she had some other concerns that weren't related to fibromyalgia. Those tests came back with a positive ANA. She had the lab run the test again to make sure it wasn't a lab error. It came back positive again. She then decided to run an ENA panel test. It came back positive too for both Anti-SS-A (Ro) and Anti-SS-B (La).

"At this point, she tells me to see my eye doctor. The eye doctor performs a couple of tests: Schirmer's tear test and the dye test. She also checked the quality of my tears. I do produce some tears, although not much, but my tears do not contain any of the lipids, proteins, or other things in tears that are needed for the tears to adhere to the eye."

I was then sent to another doctor who recommended a lip biopsy. My rheumatologist didn't think it was necessary as I was diagnosed with Sjogren's at that point so it wasn't done. She also didn't do any of the saliva tests because she said it was very obvious that I don't produce much. I was diagnosed with Primary Sjogren's Syndrome.

"I use three types of eye drops to try and prevent my corneas from being scratched too badly. I take medications to dampen my immune system and deal with some of the pain from Sjogren's and another autoimmune disorder I have. I have a medication that I use to increase tear, sweat, and saliva production. I carry fluids with me everywhere and I have to have fluids when I eat because I can't swallow if I don't. I also deal with chronic fatigue."

"I have been living with Sjogren's for 26 years. I have to have lab work every 12 weeks and I have to see my rheumatologist every 3 to 6 months to check the progression of the disease and to make sure my meds aren't screwing up my liver. I have to see my eye doctor every year to make sure my corneas aren't getting too badly scratched and to reconsider other options for treatment. I currently use three different eye drops numerous times a day in addition to the med that helps tear production. Right now, we have been debating on having eye drops made from my own blood. It's expensive though and not covered by insurance. I also have to see my dentist at least twice a year since losing teeth is a common problem with Sjogren's because of the lack of saliva. I also chew gums and mints that have xylitol to help reduce bacteria and provide comfort to my dry mouth. I also take really good care of my teeth with brushing and flossing."

I also have Raynaud's phenomenon (also known as secondary Raynaud's). It is often seen in people with Sjogren's and affects the blood flow to the fingers and toes.

"This is what Sjogren's can be like and is like for many. It is hard to diagnose so it is common to go a long time without being diagnosed. I think it is getting better, but still not great. Sometimes, people are even misdiagnosed with it because the symptoms can be found in so many other diseases. Some people have it more mild. Some people have it more severe. There are a lot of symptoms besides dry eyes and dry mouth that people can have. It can cause joint pain and it can attack organs. It can increase the risks of developing lymphoma cancer. Sjogren's is a serious disease and the treatments for it are pretty strong too. I've tried a lot of different things to try and treat it before settling on what I've been doing the last few years. It sucks, but any chronic debilitating disease sucks. I have just learned how to manage it and live with it."
